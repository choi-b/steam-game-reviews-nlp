       "  'review': 'No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it. \\n\\nWhen you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.\\n\\nYou win or you learn, you never lose.\\n\\n[b] CS will never die. [/b]\\n\\nEdit: Source 2 is still not out. You can play on 128 tick rate servers on third party clients like FaceIt, ESEA, 5E Play etc.',\n",

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\\n\\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\\n\\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it\\'s F2P i feel like it\\'s gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\\n\\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I\\'ve gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn\\'t a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\\n\\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn\\'t a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren\\'t.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in  the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.\\nIt was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. \\n\\nSome years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. \\n\\nWe formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.\\nHowever, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called \"CS Promod\" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.\\n\\nAfter a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm\\'s ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. \\n\\nCS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro\\'s do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol\\' days (from what i\\'ve read).\\n\\nThough it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. \\n\\nSince all those years i\\'ve tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.\\n\\nHowever if you\\'re looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.\\n\\nI hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community. \\n\\nBest Regards\\nKnight',\n",

       "  'review': 'The competitive Counter-Strike scene is at its peak. There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.\\n\\nI played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product \\n\\nCounter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).\\n\\nBecause a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.\\n\\nIt was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).\\n\\nPlaying Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).\\n\\nPlaying Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.\\n\\nIf you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.\\n\\nIn the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"As someone who has played the RU version for 1000hrs+ and have leveled two characters legit and boosted 8 of them (to 50) my two cents about the topic:\\n\\n+ The game is a fun journey from start to the endgame. The leveling process gets a bit dull, but on your first character it's manageable.\\n\\n+ The start of the endgame is quite fun. When you first hit 50 there's a lot 'island quest' storylines to complete, reputation quests to unlock, new guardian fights/new dungeons/new raids to experience, some 'sea events' and other 'timed events' to check out. Progression feels pretty good and smooth (until you gear gets around +9, the +10-+15 upgrades are significantly 'harder' to succeed => More fails => More costs => Way slower progress).\\n\\n+ The equalized arena PvP is fun although very CC-heavy and takes a little learning curve to get into. However the rewards are quite poor beyond the 'weekly' ones, so unless you are really into PvP you probably won't spend a lot of time playing it. The ranked PvP is only TRUE SOLO QUEUE, so no premades (which is pretty fun for solo players!).\\n\\nWhat does this actually have to do with potential P2W and 'forced alts'?\\n\\n+ Kinda tricked you with the topic. The game is a fun journey even before you need to think about spending.\\n\\nTo the actual topic:\\n\\n+ Once you hit your first progression wall (starting from +9 / +10 upgrading) you'll start to see yourself being handicapped by various resources. It might be materials (drops from limited daily dungeons/daily quests etc.), it might be shillings (daily dungeon/daily quests/'limited' cube dungeon), or it might be gold (weekly dungeons/weekly raids/weekly quests). To get through this wall you'll either need to just take it slow (log-in and do your daily/weekly things) or go faster (start making alts that allow you to farm more of the aforementioned) or go super fast (start top-upping with $/€'s and turn that into gold to get the resources needed for the upgrade gamble).\\n\\n+ 'Taking it slow' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character\\n\\n+ 'Going faster' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character + 1-2 hours or so per WEEK per alt character\\n\\n+ 'Going super fast' is only limited by your bank account <- beware though getting to 'max gear' as soon as possible removes many gaming goals you might have when 'taking it slow' or 'going faster'\\n\\nNow there are other monetizations that boost your progression in various ways but these are laid out in other posts and are not that significant. Basically with 50$ you'll get all the permanent things you'll ever 'need' and then you have the option of running the recurring 'crystalline aura (sub)' for extra benefits. The only thing I'd raise as a 'must-have' is the pet which is around 5-10$ and it's ACCOUNT WIDE, so you'll only need one of them. The reason for the pet is auto-looting, which is a major convinience for your daily dungeon running (the pet picks up the constant loot pinata from the daily dungeons instead of having to run around furiously smackin the loot button). Pets are also given out through events so you are likely to get one for free sooner or later.\\n\\nTLDR; The game is a fun journey from 1-50 regardless of whether you spend a single dime or not. When you get to the mid-late game (of the current patch) you'll either take it slow (1 character), go faster (alts) or you go super fast (spending $/€'s).\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I know what you\\'re thinking, \"Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!\" Well, that\\'s the funny thing about this game. You don\\'t really realize what you\\'re getting into until you reach the true endgame. I\\'ll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. \\n\\nFirst off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there\\'s certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is.\\n\\nI reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn\\'t coming from your friends, or other players, no, it\\'s coming from the devs. They\\'re laughing at you. \"Look at this loser\" you hear them say, \"he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot\".\\n\\nNow I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it\\'s very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. \\n\\nThe last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself \"Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don\\'t, quit, and live a happier life?\" So I did. I don\\'t think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention...\\n\\nBasically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I didn\\'t like how this game made me feel anymore. I wasn\\'t having fun anymore. I\\'m sick of hearing laughter in the distance. I\\'d rather be happy. I\\'d rather spend my time on things in life that add value and joy and peace to my soul. This game just feels like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to get me to buy some and hang out with them. Fuck that.\\n\\nOh, and the game\\'s bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed.\\n\\n*edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn\\'t played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more afterwards to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon\\'s are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It\\'s not worth it. As new games and MMO\\'s come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on. Thanks for reading.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’m going to write this review in the hope that new players gets a basic understanding what they’re gonna get into. At the time of writing, I stopped playing the game almost 2 weeks ago. Today I logged in to take a snapshot of my character screen (like a souvenir) then I uninstalled. This is going to be a thumb-down from someone who have spent 2,000 hours in this game... yeah, I’m going to be *that* kind of person for once.\\n\\nLost Ark is a game that gives you a lot of thing to do but you’re not going to particularly enjoy it. If I have to give an honest opinion about how much I enjoyed Lost Ark in the 2k hours I’ve played, I’d say maybe 20% was fun while 80% was a waste of time. The game WANTS you to waste that time so that you get to the good part.\\n\\nReminder: I’m writing this for NEW PLAYERS. So, existing players who gonna read this and comment (I won’t disable comment, criticize within reason) just keep in mind that your/our experience from launch and the experience of someone new today is going to be a stark contrast.\\n\\nThe story is just your average MMORPG shtick. Very likely you’re going to stop paying attention at the poor English localization half hour in the game and you’ll start mashing your G key (thus the meme you might have seen already). You’re going to press G for the next 12 hours or so if you’re fast and you don’t get too sidetracked. Else you’re looking about 15 hours of G-spamming.\\n\\nThe story is not compelling, you get an occasional cool cutscenes which pretty much tells you everything you need to know then you are sent on your way to do the tedious of story question: Go to X, speak with this NPC, spend 1 minute to go to Y, Speak to this NPC, go back to X and speak with that NPC again, rinse and repeat ad-nauseam.\\n\\nYou do the above for 12 – 15 hours before you hit “Tier 1 gear” at which point you start shifting in what’s gonna be your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark career.\\n\\nThe progression from T1 to mid-T3 is going to be brutal for you. It’s a dead zone, YOUR dead zone. There’s only bots wherever you’re going and the content you can do barely has players to help you with. This is literally going to be a phase where you’re going to spend roughly the next 100 hours (realistically it’s going to be closer to 200 hours) to get in a decent spot in T3. “Decent spot” is an always moving target as the game gets new content and the playerbase keeps moving forward. How tedious it’s going to get there all comes down to how merciful (or in touch with the playerbase) the dev is feeling is feeling at that time.\\n\\nAs you settle in your daily routine, you’re gonna realize how much RNG is involved in various aspect of the game and how much of it purely waste your time in a way you’re not going to enjoy. Imagine an important item locked behind a collectible that have a low chance to drop three times every week. You might get it on your first try, you might end up getting it on your 20th week (it’s a thing: ask anyone about the “Moake” hell and how group of friends gets their item drop while others are still left behind after 3 months still killing the same boss).\\n\\nGold is going to be your most valuable currency but the one you farm is going to have trash value. Why? Bots. Oh that Schoolgirl skin you see people walking around in? You can get it in the cash shop for $40 OR you can spend 45,000 gold to purchase it in the auction house. What? You’re only making 3,000k gold week? Well, tough luck! Save for 15 weeks and hope that inflation, caused by the disgusting amount of bot, is not going to make the price rocket to 60k by the time you get your 45k. Oh, you can’t even save that gold because you actually need it to hone your weapon, armor, to purchase mats, to buy dungeon/raid chest, etc, etc. Guess you’re out of luck!\\n\\nBots are rampant. About 4 months ago, I thought bots were at the worse point (looking at the price of RMT) but oh boy how wrong I was. RMT price is currently half of the price of what I thought was the worse point 4 months ago. What does that mean? The current of the game in terms of botting/RMT is TWICE as worse as the time that I thought it was worse. Inflation is at an all time high.\\n\\nIf you still manage to push through all these barriers and somehow manage to get your character high enough for the end-game raid content then congrats! Also; tough luck. No one gonna take you in their raid. The game is such a huge time sink that there’s very few who are willing to spend the time to fail with you in a raid because you WILL fail and you HAVE to fail to learn but the likeliness of having 7 other people who are either happy to teach you or fail with you is so low that you’re going to be spending quite sometime in the party finder just to go nowhere.\\n\\nThis game was fun back when it launched. Having a huge group of actual people running beside you in-world was such a breath of fresh air. It was fun, everyone was learning, everyone was talking. The current new player experience is a dead zone that I don’t wish upon anyone. The end-game is brutal once you reach it not because of the content difficulty but mostly due to how you’re going to get filtered out. Everything in between is a huge waste of time aimed at squeezing play hours from the players.\\n\\n\"Lost Ark respect your time.\": So we were told, turns out it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Lost Ark is alt friendly.\": When the game foundation is built upon having multiple characters, this statement is far from the truth. There\\'s so much things to do to make this game alt friendly but dev outright refuse. One of the biggest offender is materials such as Shards which are character bound. If this was an alt friendly game, Shards would never be bound. Neither Guardian/Destruction/Leapstones would have been bound.\\n\\nLost Ark doesn\\'t respect your time and is possibly one of the worse case of botting I have ever seen in an online game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I have read stories about people getting false bans, but never thought it would happen to me until it did. Got perma-banned for \"cheating\", tried to dispute it, they wouldn\\'t tell me the reason and sent an automated email response instead. I have never cheated (I don\\'t even know how?!) or bought gold or anything. I\\'ve just been playing everyday, enjoying with my family and my boyfriend. I even recently decided to support the game and put in real money to buy skins.\\n\\nThe fact that they took my money and then banned me a couple days later for no reason is enough to turn me off from this game.

       "  'review': 'I played the game for 445 hours. I had fun playing the game. I purchased multiple founders packs, even purchased the vanquishers pack because I was enjoying the game. One day I went to log in and found I was banned and the only information I had was a \"Code of Conduct\" violation. I submitted an appeal and after 4 days heard nothing back. I submitted another appeal and was informed that my account was commerce locked for refunding a founders pack and that the ban would not be lifted. I checked my purchase history to confirm because I didn\\'t remember refunding a founders pack and I have no refunds for Lost Ark. I appeal again and am told the matter is closed and no further responses from AGS CS are warranted. I look at the forums and find that people are being banned because they purchased skins on the in-game auction house from people that later refunded their founders packs. I was banned because someone else refunded an item after they sold it on the auction house because the skin I purchased and equipped is linked to an account that was banned. AGS is the worst gaming company I have ever worked with. They were horrible at managing New World and now they are completely botching Lost Ark. I will not recommend ANY game that AGS is involved in.\\n\\nUpdate May 1, 2022. They finally removed my ban by sending an alert saying it was an incorrectly applied ban. AGS is absolute trash.',\n",

       "  'review': '[b]If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you![/b]   Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead.  Excited yet?  You\\'ll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job!  Wait, there\\'s more!   If you don\\'t, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content.  That\\'s right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you\\'ll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you\\'ve never before dreamt of!   Don\\'t wait, apply today!\\n\\nSnarky sarcasm aside...  This is a pay to win game.  That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can.  They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that.   However, even if you pay you\\'ll find it\\'s never enough, unless you\\'ve spent thousands.   I\\'m serious, it\\'s beyond insanity. \\n\\nI have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you:  it\\'s just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content.  You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren\\'t over-geared for it, other players will  express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up.   It\\'s a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.  \\n\\nThe only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players.   All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression.   Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you\\'ll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character.  Which means you\\'ll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too.   The grind-god is never satisfied.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold.   What is gold good for?   The Auction House.  Upgrade items and gear.  Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals.   That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.   \\n\\nWhat the heck are Pheons?   They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters.  The gear you wear is what determines your item level.  After you obtain the gear, the chance you\\'ll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials.  Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in.   So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.\\n\\nHow do you get Pheons?   You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals.   How do you get blue crystals?   By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons.   Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.   \\n\\nOf course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server.   These bots have one goal - farm gold.   Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn\\'t buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue.   It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren\\'t a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag.   Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.   \\n\\nYou see the problem yet?   Even if you had millions of gold, it\\'s not the gold that is worth anything - it\\'s their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value.  [i]Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK[/i], that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups.   Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.\\n\\nWhich is another point of contention - worthless currencies.  There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum.  Maybe as many as 60?  I\\'m not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it\\'s just stupid.  Almost all of them are unnecessary. \\n\\nThere are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous \"I\\'d rather watch paint dry\" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you\\'ll try to participate in, and so much more.\\n\\nAvoid this game like the plague.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn\\'t want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.\\n\\nThe dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.\\n\\nPeople who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won\\'t replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don\\'t use the boxes.\\n\\nPvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules \"No healing potions, no ultimates\" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it\\'s my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can\\'t do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I\\'ll leave it as \"I\\'m new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being\".\\n\\nAddressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don\\'t feel it\\'s a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That\\'s pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don\\'t have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it\\'s not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.\\n\\nClasses. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won\\'t be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren\\'t available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I\\'m not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn\\'t\\' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.\\n\\nSo to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.',\n",

One day I decided to sit at a breakable wall on Mount Zagoras and attack it to get the 3 hidden/ blocked collectibles.

       "  'review': 'I have been playing since launch and have since put 2.5k+ hours into this game. I have held out as long as I could in hopes that this game would get better because it has a lot of positive aspects – cool classes, great combat, and a wide variety of vertical and horizontal content.\\n\\nHowever, the game’s community is by FAR one of the worst I have experienced. To mirror some of the other reviews – people are incredibly toxic and gate-keeping is the worst I’ve seen in any MMORPG. Don’t have enough item level, engravings, or a specific title? You’re not getting into a party. If somehow you do make it into a group, be prepared to get chewed out if you make a mistake because many raids have a raid-wipe mechanic where all eight players need to be on the same page. Your average player has very little patience for wipes and will force a group quit after a few failures instead of communicating or trying to teach players how to do a raid mechanic properly. With that said, I have met a small number of helpful players in the 8.5 months playing the game but they are definitely in the minority.\\n\\nOther issues I’ve seen with the game that haven’t been addressed are the rampant bots and inflation. I can’t speak for all regions but on NA West, the server I play is on like 75% bots and it’s honestly disgusting to see how many of them are running around the capital cities. AGS/Smilegate claim they are doing everything they can to combat the bots but it’s obviously not working – you see items on the auction house being sold for millions of gold constantly which is obviously real money transactions happening. The price of items and blue crystals (premium currency you can buy with real money or gold, needed to buy gear and cash shop items) is skyrocketing to a point that is just laughable. The price for 100 blue crystals exceeds that of Korean servers now because of how insanely out of control the botting problem is on NA servers. A single earring can cost 300k+ gold which is absurd when an 8-man raid only gives 3-5k on a weekly lockout. Class engraving books have tripled in price the past few months – it will now take upwards of 400k gold to get 20 legendary class engraving books, depending on what your build is. As a new player, it will be extremely difficult to catch up without at least swiping your credit card a little bit. \\n\\nThe last issue I have is how prevalent RNG is in this game and maybe a non-issue for those that are accustomed to this type of game. I currently have every adventurer tome at 100% except Brelshaza for South Vern and almost every collectible at 100%, key word almost. The RNG aspect is so heavily ingrained into every aspect of the game that you could get royally screwed on certain drops for months/years if you are unlucky. For example, at time of writing this, I am still missing the Lush Reed island soul and Forpe Island sea bounty to name a couple, despite having run them every time available since launch in February 2022. Gear progression is all RNG based as well – the success rate for honing your gear to the next level drops to such a small amount (1-3%) that you could spend weeks of materials/gold just to increase one piece. \\n\\nTo a lot of players I’m sure these gripes are OK and no big deal but for me personally, this is incredibly demoralizing gameplay and feels like I am wasting so much time just to fail. I’m surprised I’ve invested as much time as I have and uninstalling the game honestly feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. If you are looking to be rewarded for investing your time, look elsewhere. This is NOT a casual friendly game.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"Let me preface this by saying this review's purpose isn’t so that I get unbanned, at this point I don’t plan to ever return and play any AGS games. This is the first time I’ve been banned on any online game and this is the point that really irks me. This is here to provide some awareness for anyone who may be interested in this game and hope that others who’ve been unfairly banned will speak out so at the very least others may be aware and AGS may actually start becoming better or competent. \\n\\nBackground:\\n•\\tOver 800 hours on the account.\\n•\\tMy characters and some relevant equipment are as follows (AFAIK, Gem levels may be all over the place, 1 or 2 level 7, most were 4 or 5, few 6), I don’t bus at all and I’ve only ridden on a couple busses mostly for new 1370s. Bought the Gold Pre-release founders pack on release:\\n•\\t1462.5 Paladin – 1x level 7 Gem, assorted other gems usually all under 5 as I just forged most of my gems for 2 x level 7 Gems before the ban; all legendary accessories 3/3/3/1/1\\n•\\t1430 Glaivier – level 4-6 Gems, relic accessories 4x3, 1x1\\n•\\t1415 Deathblade – level 4-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1\\n•\\t1415 Sorceress – level 4-5 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2\\n•\\t1415 Bard – level 3-4 Gems (new Powerpassed character), legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2\\n•\\t1402.5 Gunslinger – level 3-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1 or 2\\n\\nSuspected Triggers for Ban:\\n•\\tI’ve been selling as much stuff as possible to try to get enough for Legendary Grudge Engraving. Recently, I merged all my Paladin Gems and got 2x level 7 Gems but both were damage Gems so I moved those to my DB to reforge and bought 1 level 7 CD gem for around 15k Gold I believe (NAE Market Price). The DB rerolled the 2x level 7 Gems and sold them for 16k list, 18k BO which both sold on the market. Also sold T3 Destruction Stones and Honing Stones.\\n•\\tBought a Swimsuit skin with RC and sold some of the pieces on the Market for Market price (pretty heavy fluctuation during the final weeks of the sale)\\n•\\tBought new skins for my Bard and Sorceress and replaced some of the older skins by selling on the market for market price.\\n\\nBan and Appeal Process:\\nI found out I was banned on Sunday at around 9 PM EST. Obviously, I could not tell what triggered my ban so I sent in an appeal request at Sunday at 9:16 PM.\\nI received a reply at 9:28 PM saying that my ban was permanent and the disciplinary action was merited but they did not state why I was banned apart from Cheating which still does not tell me anything. \\n\\nI sent a reply back stating I still do not know what I was accused of and I can’t provide evidence against something I do not know, noted that my characters were the ilevels above and their gems/accessories being not high value. I also noted that most of my characters had rested bonus so I probably wasn’t botting and asking for escalation and got this as automated reply saying I’ll hear back from them within 6 hours.\\n\\nAfter that I did not hear anything back. I re-sent in an appeal on Monday and it was becoming clear that they do not read these at all and just send the same prepared responses without any review. This went on constantly so at this point I’m pretty confident that they don’t ever read these and just block you. I read on their forums that sometimes the German one may actually result in an actual person reviewing the case but same response in German. I have sent in other appeals but all had the exact same response.\\n\\nSeeing as AGS refuses to even tell me why I got banned or even bother to read my appeals, the only thing that this really tells me is that the claim that Moderators read appeals is a bald-faced lie and any CM who says otherwise is perpetuating this lie.\\nBased on what I did on my account, I suspect someone who RMTs bought my gem or skins and I got flagged as a Gold Seller as based on what I could see, RMT is not necessarily a permanent ban. This was added in my later appeals but same response. My Steam account is an account with over 200 games and is my only used Steam account, to be a used as a Gold seller would be highly illogical. Also, I purchased a pre-release package so its an old account.\\n\\nNow why am I making this review? After reading the forums and Reddit about these posts, there’s usually some people mentioning that their friends also got banned unfairly but just gave up. Seeing as some of these posts are starting to crop up more, I would implore them to make some noise about it so that AGS may finally have to act. At the very least, it can provide a warning to anyone on the fence that this may happen to them and they should be wary. \\n\\ntl;dr - highest ilvl 1462.5, couple lvl 7 gems, sold 2 lvl 7 gems and some skins on the market and got banned. Appeals get a response in 5-10 minutes upholding the ban without saying why I got banned.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The game itself is magnificent. Surely, it may have some mobile like feel and it does have some of the sins of F2P model, but if you play the game, you can instantly feel that it\\'s a product of love by the development team. Fights are mechanically challenging, graphics are stunning, contents are more than enough to keep you occupied and coming back for more.\\n\\nSo why the negative review? Simple. The game is published and serviced by one of the worst companies I\\'ve experienced through out my over 2 decades of gaming. Amazon Games Studio.\\n\\nThey have done injustice to the game since pre-launch. Butchered the original version in the name of \"Westernization\". To watch the original director actually complain about what they\\'ve done, changing names of characters and applying censorship changes, on an OFFICIAL interview was simply depressing.\\n\\nGame launches, guess what happens. Server overload and instability every single day. Maintenance, patching, more problems, more down time, rinse and repeat.\\n\\nEconomy already went to complete ruin because despite the numerous warnings against how rampant the game will be with RMT and botters without proper measures in place to deal with it preemptively. Out of 1M concurrent you see, literally 50% are suspected to be bots because according to steam accomplishment, less than 15% of players even reach the end of leveling tutorial, and how inflated the market is is simply ridiculous. When community kept warning AGS about how this will happen, they said \"they will be monitoring closely\". What a joke.\\n\\nSo they finally \"do something\", mass ban wave. They pay news outlets to publish articles that they\\'re banning 1 million bot accounts and they should be praised for working hard to keep the game clean.\\n\\nState of the game remains the same. Guess what though, thousands of players get caught up in false positive bans but they have no infrastructure to support the appeal process. Hell, they literally closed down call center couple weeks ago after Lost Ark\\'s explosive launch. People get stuck in endless loop of sending ticket and receiving macro response without even getting an answer on why they got banned.\\n\\nYou have people getting perma banned for refunding founders pack PRIOR TO GAME LAUNCH, in many cases, to upgrade to a more expensive packs.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for trying to break down barrier that takes 15 minutes to break while listening to music.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for buying skins in Auction House because seller of the skin refunded.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for receiving mail attachments.\\n\\nWhat a complete and utter shitshow. What exacerbated the situation is that initially, Community Managers tried to gather information on the community forum to help the cases get reviewed.\\nThe next day, different CM closes down the topic.\\nNext day, these topics start getting deleted.\\n\\nLevel of unprofessionalism is simply incredible and the game really deserve better. \\nIn no other industry would this type of behavior and incompetence be tolerated. It\\'s a tragedy.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The core gameplay of Lost Ark is fantastic. The classes have unique power fantasies and are fun, and the legion raids are some of the most fun activities in any MMO I\\'ve played. Unfortunately, I can\\'t recommend the game since it\\'s bogged down by everything else.\\n\\nFirst off, Lost Ark has a severe gate-keeping problem. The game heavily encourages players to create more characters through events like the powerpass and express pass, and each new character has a set of daily and weekly activities they can do, including three legion raids per week. A total of 6 characters can earn gold from those raids, and the gold and gear reward from those raids form the bulk of gold income for an account.\\n\\nThree raids on six characters is a lot of time, and public groups for them often require proof of previous raid clear experience as a result. After all, nobody wants to waste time on wipes when they have other raids, dailies, and weeklies to do.  If you don\\'t have that visible experience in a new raid (raid titles, gear, very high item level), you potentially face hours trying to get into a group to get that visible experience to make it easier to get into groups. New players coming into the game often can reach the item level and gearing required to complete a raid, but very few experienced players want to play with them. And the game does not provide any incentive for playing with new players. The only way to do the legion raids and get the gear from them as a new player is to buy a paid carry, often using gold from the raid itself. Apart from the gold loss, a negative side effect is that players who buy carries often don\\'t get the mechanical experience of actually doing the raids, which only get more complex and challenging.\\n\\nMeaningfully progressing to the point where gate-keeping is a minor issue requires a lot of time, especially as a new player and even for the first few legion raids. This time multiplies for every character you create. I have 6 characters and doing the daily and weekly activities on them often feels like a part-time job. While rested bonuses build up for dailies you haven\\'t done, the rewards are far less than doing them every day (75-66%), which results in slower progression. The other aspect of dailies that make it feel like a job is they\\'re far less interesting than the raids. The main culprit is chaos dungeons. Chaos dungeons are basic add-clear dungeons which are similar to rifts from Diablo, but the mobs are far less interesting and mechanically complicated. Simply put, they\\'re a chore. They don\\'t encourage the kind of build-crafting and mechanical skill that legion raids do that are the most fun parts of the game. Unfortunately, they\\'re also the most valuable, giving the most amount of materials needed to progress a character. Unfortunately, Smilegate has already said and reiterated that the requirement of doing dailies on each character will not change.\\n\\nThe social systems of Lost Ark is among the worst I\\'ve experienced in an MMO. While guilds exist, the game does not incentivize playing with guildmates. There\\'s no account-wide guild membership system; each character has to join an individual guild and each guild has a low character limit. Combined with the requirement that each character\\'s name be unique, I\\'m often wondering who a character belongs to. The most developed guild feature in the game is a guild shop, which rewards currency for logging on every day and doing weekly quests, which add to the list of activities needed to do on each character. The most meaningful interactions for a guild are on Discord.\\n\\nA lot of the systems I\\'ve criticized have an easy way to circumvent them: by paying real money. With the currency exchange, you can trade money for gold, which allows you to buy almost everything needed to gear up your character: materials for increasing item level, high-quality gear, item quality increases, card set damage bonuses, paid raid carries, and more. Lost Ark even has packages with these items for direct sale. This is the aspect of the game that feels the most \"pay-to-win\", and it unfortunately drives the severe bot problem Lost Ark has.\\n\\nLastly, AGS and Smilegate interactions with the community is lacking. Smilegate in particular does not acknowledge the western version of the game in any way. Despite Smilegate stating they aspire to be a global game developer, it\\'s clear they\\'re far from it. Often AGS community managers won\\'t know if something in a patch or major update until a few days before its released. And the major issues which elicit a sluggish and inadequate response from Smilegate, as the developer, feel as if the western version isn\\'t a priority despite its status as one of the highest-revenue games on Steam. The most they provided to the western audience during their last major yearly presentation, LoA On, was a lackluster English translation. The description of a free reward pack as being \"for the KR region only\" was the insult to injury. This is behavior that is far from other MMO developers like Square Enix, and is in contrast to Smilegate\\'s Korean reputation as being transparent and engaging with their community.\\n\\nI can\\'t recommend this game to a new player. Unless someone new is willing to spend an exorbitant amount of time to gear up and find guilds and parties willing to take on new players, they won\\'t have a good time. Many friends who have similar hour counts to mine have burned out. I\\'ll also likely take an extended break soon, and potentially leave entirely. If new players are gate-kept and experienced players quit, it doesn\\'t feel like a trend that is healthy for the game in the long run.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve played enough to know what this game is and what it is not.  I will start with what it is.\\n\\nLOST ARK IS: \\n- Very pretty.  The graphics are appealing, even if not stunning. We have to remember that this game is not a new game. It has been out in other countries for years. At the time of it\\'s true release though, it was top notch.\\n\\n- Easy to play and navigate. It reminds me of a browser game in that it walks you through each quest and a very \"hand-holding\" kind of way. You get big map markers that tell you right where to go. You don\\'t even need to read the dialogue of NPCs if you don\\'t want to.\\n\\n- Deeper than it seems.  Although it plays like a simple browser game. Lost Ark has plenty of systems to keep a player occupied. There are skill, crafting and even a type of reputation system that allows the player to get more advanced items and stats. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here. I could see spending more time playing with these systems than actually hacking and slashing in some circumstances,\\n\\n- Mostly a true free-to-play game. A player can play all the way through Lost Ark without spending a dime. It may take longer and not be as individualized (you will be playing a cookie cutter version of each character), but it can be done. There are also ways to earn in-game currency if a person really wants to do some customization of their character\\'s looks. There are some features that make the game a \"Pay to Progress\" game, but nothing locks you out of content so you can play it all if you have the patience.\\n\\nLOST ARK IS NOT:\\n\\n- Diablo. The hype train for Lost Ark seemed to be marketed toward fans of Diablo and it\\'s hack n slash mega-loot game play, but this isn\\'t a fair comparison. There are some superficial similarities, but fans of the Diablo franchise won\\'t get their fix from this game. Lost Ark is much more like WoW than Diablo, but even that isn\\'t a great comparison. \\n\\n-A game changer. As with most mega-hyped games, Lost Ark is not going to change the meta when it comes to ARPGs or RPGS. It\\'s a fun game with some complexity, but it doesn\\'t so much do anything new as it incorporates bits and pieces from other games and melds them together.  The wait was so very long for this game that it will take some time before honest reviews are common. There is a glamour spell on the game that will wear off in time to reveal a solid, fun, and less-innovative game than we thought.\\n\\nConclusion: It is a game that fans of the genre should try. There is nothing bad about it. The story is standard good vs evil kind of stuff. They stuff the game with pretty girls and macho boys, just as all such games seem to. It\\'s a decent game that had zero hope of living up to the hype. \\n\\n\\n 7.7 / 10 - Fun. Free. Worth playing.\\n\\n Note that I am not presenting a \"Pro vs Con\" list. I am not that kind of critic. Just because I don\\'t like a feature does not make it bad.  Game Devs make decisions and I am not going to second guess them in a Free to Play game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"While you are in your 24k queue on an EU server here's a guide on how to make pizza dough for a delicious pizza of your choice!\\n\\nIngredients:\\n500g '00' flour or plain flour, plus extra for dusting\\n1 tsp salt\\n½ tsp dried yeast (not fast-action)\\n400ml warm water\\nOil, for greasing.\\n\\nSTEP 1\\nIt’s easiest to make this in a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). Put the flour and salt in the bowl and mix the yeast into the water. It’s always a good idea to wait 5 mins before using the liquid to see if the yeast is working – little bits will start to rise to the top and you’ll know it’s active.\\n\\nSTEP 2\\nTurn on the motor and pour in the liquid. Keep the speed on medium-high and it should come together as a ball. If the bottom is still sticking, tip in 1-2 tbsp of flour. Knead for 5-7 mins until the dough is shiny and it springs back when you press your finger into it. (If kneading by hand, it will take you about 10 mins.) Try not to add too much flour if you can. This is a slightly sticky dough, but that keeps it light and it rises beautifully.\\n\\nSTEP 3\\nUse oiled hands to remove the dough from the hook and bowl. Oil another bowl and place the dough in it. Turn it around so that it’s lightly coated in the oil. Cover tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size. If it’s a hot day, it should only take 2 hrs to rise, but it could take 4 hrs if it’s cold. (If you don’t plan to use the dough for a day or two, place it in the fridge straight away; take it out 3-4 hrs before using. Punch it down first and bring it together on a floured surface.)\\n\\nSTEP 4\\nDivide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls (see Shaping the dough in tips, below) – dust them in flour as they will be sticky. Keep them covered with a tea towel or cling film while you prepare the toppings. (you can also freeze them in sealed bags. Just thaw in the fridge on the day, then bring to room temperature 3 hrs before using.)\\n\\nSTEP 5\\nTo shape the dough: If you want to get air pockets and a light but crisp dough, then don’t use a rolling pin. It flattens and pops the air bubbles. (Two days in the fridge will produce the most air bubbles – take it out three to four hours before using.) If your dough is at room temperature, you can use your fingers to gently stretch the dough out. Once it’s about 16cm, place the disc over the tops of your hands (not palm side) and use them to stretch it further, up to about 25cm. You can start pressing out the other discs, then wait to do the final bit when you’re ready to cook. Once you’ve mastered stretching the dough out, you can experiment with other shapes: rectangles, rounds or squares all look authentic.\\n\\nSTEP 6\\nTo cook the pizza: An outdoor gas barbecue is best for controlling the temperature, but charcoal will give your pizza a more authentic, smoky flavour. For gas, turn the flames down to medium-low so that the bottom of the pizza doesn't burn. When cooking on a charcoal barbecue, let the coals turn grey before you pop on the pizza.\\n\\nSTEP 7\\nPlace the pizza on a floured baking sheet (with no edge) or a pizza peel – this is a flat pizza paddle with a long handle, which makes it easier to get the dough on and off the grill. The flour will provide the 'wheels' for it to slide onto the grill – don’t use oil as it sticks more and won’t transfer as well.\\n\\nSTEP 8\\nMake sure the grill is hot and the flames have died back if cooking on charcoal. Slide the dough onto the grill, close the lid (if your barbecue has one) and give it three to four minutes. The dough will puff up; it's ready when the bottom has light brown stripes. Use tongs to pull the dough off and turn it upside down.\\n\\nSTEP 9\\nAssemble the pizza of your choice – see 'Goes well with', right, for topping suggestions. Remember that less is more, as the dough will stay crisper and the toppings will cook better.\\n\\nSTEP 10\\nPlace the pizza back on the grill, uncooked-side down, and shut the lid. Give it another three to four minutes, then remove when the cheese is melted and the toppings are hot.\\n\\nIf your queue is still not over you may be obligated to go to the pub for a couple of hours!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't recommend this game to anyone, here's why:\\n\\n-gate keeping culture. You won't experience latest content if you're a damage dealer class simply due to lack of supports and abundance of damage dealers. You'll be staring at a lobby screen and scrolling through a dozen of lobby rooms named ''LF SUPPORT'', making your own room is pointless because you'll be waiting for a support for hours only for your party to disband after first wipe. Of course if you have many friends and a guild you're good to go, for the introverts I'm gonna say sorry guys and gals - don't waste your time here.\\n\\n-the western publisher doesn't care. About anything. At all. Taiwanese release has been announced and it promises many ways to deal with bots, one of which is registration using a phone number, employing a real person so he manually bans bots, no censorship on female skins, you get the gist of it. The western release is a short time gamble to squeeze as much money in as little time as possible, my predictions for 2023 will be around 40+ thousand concurrent players gate-keeping each other and crying on official forums by the end of the year.\\n\\n-one of the most toxic communities I've seen, your mistakes during the end-game raids will be intolerable and you'll be swiftly removed from the party. You're a new player ? You'll be playing alone for the first 300 hours. When you reach T3 you'll probably get denied from the parties due to your engravings not being up to their standard. To reach that said ''standard'' you'll have to pay a lot of money for engravings, accessories and gems which either will make you RMT or quit when the realization comes. One of the most unfriendliest game for a new player to ever exist.\\n\\n-the routine of a non-casual lost ark player is to waste 4-6 hours a day managing 6+ alternative characters, doing chaos dungeons, guardian raids, legion raids, abyssal raids with EACH SINGLE OF THEM. If you like doing same monotonous, soul sucking in-game manual labor for 4-6 hours every single day and it's your jam, go for it. It's a classic Korean MMO formula and the soulless grind is the core of it. \\n\\n-currently the world is empty apart from few hub areas, the days are long gone when you would meet a player on a strange remote island, the horizontal content has been done long time ago by the majority of players. This game barely classifies as mmo IMO\\n\\nPlease find another game to play, this ain't it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Original review: https://web.archive.org/web/20221016031156/https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051017496/recommended/1599340/\\n\\nTL;DR: Game is still fun and the chances of it pulling you in are high, but all you'll see at the lower levels will be bots, the inflation caused by the botting is at an all time high, completely decimating the economy, and with how the game functions at 'end game', if you do not find and join a guild IMMEDIATELY, the only way you'll be able to progress your character will be to pay for runs in which you die early on in the fight to get carried through the content. That content being the raids that you may have heard being promoted as the most 'fun' aspect of the game. Not really going to be fun 'playing' the game as a glorified doormat for weeks on end, so find a Guild, fast, if you're serious about playing. Don't expect to find many practice or free carry runs either because time is the most valuable commodity in Lost Ark. The veterans that have the experience to help have 6 characters to run these raids on and do not want to waste hours of their time helping out strangers that have no clue what they're doing, unless you pay them, of course.\\n\\nI left back around early June and decided to return to the game when the 1415 honing buff dropped recently. Figured with the buff, now would be a perfect time to return, right? Ahaha...haha. No.\\n\\nFirst, the bots. Dear lord, the bots. See, back in my day, Punika was a paradise. Sure, you had a few Utytiuwooll's and Frrwyyyojl's around, but every village is going to have a few bad apples, ya know? Well, upon coming back to the game, I see that they have multiplied like rabbit's and are now infesting the whole island. This once peaceful and tranquil paradise, filled love and lailai's is now a nightmarish hellscape with you tripping over these degenerates at every turn. What's even more terrifying is when they run up to you, stare at you with their cold, soulless eyes, and type 'hh'. Why they are trying to communicate now, who knows, but run. Run and do NOT look back!\\n\\nAnyways, upon my return I got my main to 1415, and then decided to try and do a legion raid and queue'd up via matchmaking. Nothing. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15, 20, 30, 40...Yes, 40 minutes (I am not to proud of this, ngl) spent in a matchmaking queue and the only thing I got done was finishing off a can of dr pepper, eating a granola bar and getting mauled by my cat for not giving him his treat quick enough. (Obviously completely my fault, but I am now a better trained human and have been providing him with his treats in a more timely manner).\\n\\nTurns out, no ones queue's in matchmaking for raids, you got to go into party finder to find a group. Alright, sure, sounds reasonable, right? Nope. See, the issue here is that there are no practice runs available. What I thought would be used for practice, aka matchmaking, is not utilized. So the only runs you're going to find are either bus runs (Pay me 2000+ gold so you can be a glorified dirt ornament as I carry you through the content pleb) or title runs (having the title of killing the boss already so they know you know what you're doing and they not waste hours locked in a run with people who don't know the fight. So basically, they only want to play with others like themselves) or alt runs (And you better be an alt that knows what they're doing, because if you're dying a lot, well, better have some lube ready and lather that sh*t on nice and thick all over cause the verbal assault you're about to be subjected to will be a lot easier to handle before the group quits and unceremoniously kicks your sorry newbie arse out. You're not worthy to play with them).\\n\\nSo if you're new, or you've returned to the game after a hiatus and your guild is, well, dead, find a new one. Immediately. The experience will be a lot better and it'll be mentality healthier for you in the long run. However, if you're one of those Kirito types, and don't want to join a guild cause you're just too cool for one, enjoy progressing through the game at a snails pace since a large chunk of your in game income will go toward the bus drivers. You'll end up either joining a guild or quitting at the end though because eventually you'll realize that paying 2000-4000g for your character to EAT DIRT isn't exactly the game you signed up for. You may think it tastes better cause mommy Vykas stepped in it, but it's still dirt fam. Stop. Just, no. Okay? NO!\\n\\nJoin a guild. Really.\\n\\nThen there is the inflation. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, do not play on NAW. It is going to cost you anywhere between 2900-3000g for 95 blue crystals, the freemium currency in game. The bots have decimated the economy just about everywhere, but NAW has it the worst. If you're new, try other regions first, as it will be a lot more beneficial for you in the long run in terms of cost. However, bare in mind that there is also no way to transfer your account from one region to another due to 'limitations' according to both Smilegate and AGS, so do keep that in mind.\\n\\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for your time, especially if you're an active player of the game. Honestly, I understand that your time could be better spent on your 5th alt, running your 5th set of raids, on your 10th chaos dungeon and guardian raid for the day. I'd much rather be farming chaos dungeons myself, but it's Saturday and I still haven't found a replacement guild to join, so I figured while I lick and drool all over the cobblestones in Valtan,  I'd at least type up this updated review for the game. Gotta do everything to maximize my time in Lost Ark, amirite?! Hurray for roster progression!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"In LA, you will eventually end up in a loop of incohesive mundane daily/weekly tasks done through window hopping, per mobile game standards, with little to no immersion. (Mobile MMOs fan? Keep reading.)\\n\\nYou will either require multiple alts and a tremendous amount of time to funnel upgrading resources toward your main character or a lot of money to purchase what you need in order to access the latest content on release. (Enjoy grinding/spending? Keep reading.)\\n\\nThat is, if you're lucky enough to make it through the honing(upgrading) system without witnessing all of your efforts and/or money go to waste into the RNG abyss that it is. Playing this game will expose you to gambling in all its glory. It is riddled with it through most of its gimmicks. I'm guessing the feeling I'm trying to extend must be somewhat close to going to the casino on a weekend and losing all of your hard earned money. Which is frankly, not what I'm looking for in an MMORPG. Some will cope with the fact that there is a pity system. Pitiful indeed. Lets be fair though, going to the casino is a choice and so is playing this game.\\n\\nExtra features: \\n                         - World breaking record for game with the longest booting time.\\n                         - Random crashes and/or disconnects without possibility of re-entry into lost content.                      \\n                         - Double digits amount of different currencies to keep things clear...ly confusing.\\n                         - Huge AH fees for minimal profit and maximum salt.\\n                         - A game so fun even hundreds of thousands of bots are playing it.\\n                         - RMTs gold selling spam included. \\n                         - Innovative horizontal content, if you're age 5 and under.\\n                         - Frequent patch delays to keep you on your toes.\\n                         - Last minute announcements for optimal surprise effect.\\n                         - Fantastic transmogs inspired from real life items like, a t-shirt, glasses or a hat.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, LA has some good content but it is weekly gated and vastly outweighed by all the frustrations encountered. Look, I played my fair share, this game seemed to have a lot of potential. The combat system is amazing and refreshing. It was good enough to keep me around hoping it would be a great MMO. Sadly, everything I mentioned above added to the utter disrespect SG and AG seem to have for their customer's time and resources finally got the best of me.\\n\\nI would also like to point out that, by design, LA will make it quite difficult for you to experience the game with your friends. More often than not, I found myself playing on my own, with strangers or even with bots. Everyone would be online simply doing their own thing. (The mobile game template strikes again.)\\n\\nOn a side note, I would consider this game to be pay to progress rather than pay to win.\\n\\nFinally, gaming should be a positive and quality experience, if not at least for the most part. This turned out to be anything but. To each their own opinion, here was mine.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Ok so full honest and fair review on Lost Ark, Im about 50 hours in right now, Lvl 43 (Soft Cap is 50). \\n- Combat - Absolutely one of my favorite combat systems of any game period. Really makes you feel badass every time you engage in a fight, think Diablo mixed with Dynasty Warriors, like just isometric carnage through waves of enemies.\\n- Quests - The highest/Lowest point for me, the game is a theme park at its core, so some quests are legit like being part of a cinematic movie and feel epic and a \"Ride\" while between missions its your standard \"Click, kill X enemies, collect X items\" rinse and repeat mode. \\n- Story - I personally like the story, everything is skippable, so if you dont want it you can move forward but there are some really good cinematic spots that are badass and others that are standard fair but the writing is solid through out but still your standard \"Hero\" story shit.\\n- MMO - Its a full fledged MMO. Groups, Guilds, Raids, Dungeons, PVP, the social aspects are well done and consistent with modern MMOs.\\n- Pacing - The game is extremely well paced imo, you are slowly introduced to game mechanics as you move forward, first 10 levels are standard fight and quest, then 20+ is more dungeons, resource gathering, then 30+ you get your Stronghold which is a full management sim, 40+ you get your ship which is a full-travel and exploration mode, etc etc.\\nClosing thoughts: The game just has a ton of shit to do, so as long as you like the combat enough to stomach the standard fair questing as you progress in unlocking the core mechanics and move on its worth it imo',\n",

       "  'review': 'Be warned that, at the moment, playing Lost Ark puts your Steam account at risk of a permanent, automatic game ban that mimics a VAC ban (appears in red text on your public Steam profile, but is issued by the game publisher/developers), simply due to AGS being a terrible publisher who uses poorly designed automated systems for both in-game moderation and followup support rather than real humans.\\n\\nWhile this has not yet affected me, thousands of users are affected on the official forums and the community managers are in crisis mode trying to sort it out, as in the past they have claimed each ban is looked at/issued by a human being, and it has quickly become apparent that is false after thousands of users have posted evidence of being issued nonsensical bans by the same shoddy automated systems AGS has used since New World.\\n\\nIf you talk in public/area chat, you risk a public ban appearing on your Steam profile.\\n\\nIf you buy something on the in-game market from another player, you risk a public ban appearing on your Steam profile. \\n\\nIf you receive mail from another player, you risk a public ban appearing on your Steam profile.\\n\\nIf another player reports you for any reason, you risk a public ban appearing on your Steam profile. \\n\\nMeanwhile, the game is full of 100,000+ gold-farming bots that go unhindered and have already heavily affected the in-game economy. Neither Easy Anti-Cheat nor AGS has done anything to stop these bots or their speed hacking en masse through all areas of the game.\\n\\nFor these issues alone, I would not recommend this game to anyone at this time.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Lost Ark [/h1]\\n\\nUnfortunately i can\\'t recommend this game. Despite interesting classes, amazing skills and a enjoyable early-mid game ( leveling up your character ) the late game is just not fun...  You just farm doing same 2-3 stuff everyday then change to your alt character and do exactly the same to propably feed your main character. And then you pray for RNG god to make that 5% honing chance to upgrade your gear level. And you still propably failed it dozens of times. And then you got back to do tidious,boring stuff or joined the pit of hell and payed dozens of $$$ to buy that honing gear only to throw that sweet money of your to oblivion. Again.\\nDespite this and army of bots that is invading the game... u can still have some fun as F2P player like me, there\\'s some really cool scenes/story missions but overall most quest expierence is that you will be most likely just hitting that skip button \"G\". Then kill 2 gyus standing next to the npc or bring some sweet flowers cus he can\\'t pick them from 4 meters from his spot... and your\\'re done for. Do some similiar quest 100 times, then u got that one interesting story mission and of course u guess it.. [b] REPEAT. [/b]\\n\\nUpdate: Bruh because a lot people cry, \"have you never played any mmo!?\" I did, but grinding in Lost Ark fells just unrewarding, unejoyable and boring. If you enjoy doing exactly same thing dozens of time just to have that Number +1 to the equipment then good for you ^_^. \\nIt\\'s my personal opinion and deal with it :D',\n",

       "  'review': \"While you are in your 24k queue on an EU server here's a guide on how to make pizza dough for a delicious pizza of your choice!\\n\\nIngredients:\\n500g '00' flour or plain flour, plus extra for dusting\\n1 tsp salt\\n½ tsp dried yeast (not fast-action)\\n400ml warm water\\nOil, for greasing.\\n\\nSTEP 1\\nIt’s easiest to make this in a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). Put the flour and salt in the bowl and mix the yeast into the water. It’s always a good idea to wait 5 mins before using the liquid to see if the yeast is working – little bits will start to rise to the top and you’ll know it’s active.\\n\\nSTEP 2\\nTurn on the motor and pour in the liquid. Keep the speed on medium-high and it should come together as a ball. If the bottom is still sticking, tip in 1-2 tbsp of flour. Knead for 5-7 mins until the dough is shiny and it springs back when you press your finger into it. (If kneading by hand, it will take you about 10 mins.) Try not to add too much flour if you can. This is a slightly sticky dough, but that keeps it light and it rises beautifully.\\n\\nSTEP 3\\nUse oiled hands to remove the dough from the hook and bowl. Oil another bowl and place the dough in it. Turn it around so that it’s lightly coated in the oil. Cover tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size. If it’s a hot day, it should only take 2 hrs to rise, but it could take 4 hrs if it’s cold. (If you don’t plan to use the dough for a day or two, place it in the fridge straight away; take it out 3-4 hrs before using. Punch it down first and bring it together on a floured surface.)\\n\\nSTEP 4\\nDivide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls (see Shaping the dough in tips, below) – dust them in flour as they will be sticky. Keep them covered with a tea towel or cling film while you prepare the toppings. (you can also freeze them in sealed bags. Just thaw in the fridge on the day, then bring to room temperature 3 hrs before using.)\\n\\nSTEP 5\\nTo shape the dough: If you want to get air pockets and a light but crisp dough, then don’t use a rolling pin. It flattens and pops the air bubbles. (Two days in the fridge will produce the most air bubbles – take it out three to four hours before using.) If your dough is at room temperature, you can use your fingers to gently stretch the dough out. Once it’s about 16cm, place the disc over the tops of your hands (not palm side) and use them to stretch it further, up to about 25cm. You can start pressing out the other discs, then wait to do the final bit when you’re ready to cook. Once you’ve mastered stretching the dough out, you can experiment with other shapes: rectangles, rounds or squares all look authentic.\\n\\nSTEP 6\\nTo cook the pizza: An outdoor gas barbecue is best for controlling the temperature, but charcoal will give your pizza a more authentic, smoky flavour. For gas, turn the flames down to medium-low so that the bottom of the pizza doesn't burn. When cooking on a charcoal barbecue, let the coals turn grey before you pop on the pizza.\\n\\nSTEP 7\\nPlace the pizza on a floured baking sheet (with no edge) or a pizza peel – this is a flat pizza paddle with a long handle, which makes it easier to get the dough on and off the grill. The flour will provide the 'wheels' for it to slide onto the grill – don’t use oil as it sticks more and won’t transfer as well.\\n\\nSTEP 8\\nMake sure the grill is hot and the flames have died back if cooking on charcoal. Slide the dough onto the grill, close the lid (if your barbecue has one) and give it three to four minutes. The dough will puff up; it's ready when the bottom has light brown stripes. Use tongs to pull the dough off and turn it upside down.\\n\\nSTEP 9\\nAssemble the pizza of your choice – see 'Goes well with', right, for topping suggestions. Remember that less is more, as the dough will stay crisper and the toppings will cook better.\\n\\nSTEP 10\\nPlace the pizza back on the grill, uncooked-side down, and shut the lid. Give it another three to four minutes, then remove when the cheese is melted and the toppings are hot.\\n\\nIf your queue is still not over you may be obligated to go to the pub for a couple of hours!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Me and my friends played Russian version of Lost Ark and already have some kind of opinion on the game. First 50 levels are just spamming G button and it can get boring really fast to the point that you will just quit. Bear with me and get to 50. Maybe to some people story will look interesting, so they won't have any problems reaching level 50. After you reach 50 - - real content starts. Bosses are challenging, dungeons are fun and diverse. You can collect mokoko seeds, cards and other collectible items which give you some advantage. You can sail on your boat to other island and explore them for various content. There is a lot to do in the game. PVP arena is equal so no one can pay their way to highest ranks, It takes skill to get to the top. If you are into PVP - Lost Ark is a must play. This game is a good quality Korean mmorpg.\\nBut it has timegated progress and heavy alt characters dependence. If you want to progress significantly faster - you will need to create alts. Not just one, but many of them. This is a big problem of this game, especially if you never played korean mmorpg before. Basically at the end, Lost Ark becomes your second job if you want to progress faster.\\nAmazon promised less agressive monetisation compared to Russian and Korean versions of the game. Monetisation is not a big problem in this game if you ask me. I have never payed a dime and still enjoyed the game to it's fullest potential. But some people think that it needs some kind of rework. We will see how it pans out.\\nTo conclude my graphomania, give Lost Ark a chance and play it. After all it's a free to play game so you won't lose anything.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'SOLO player here. After about 65 hours I hit the end of the world campaign. According to some, \"now the real game starts\", but not for me. I have no interest in grinding the same raids over and over, or in worrying about optimizing my build. No, I will continue doing the side quests that I missed, explore the world a bit further, and then stop.\\n\\nAnd at the end of all that, I got a LOT of hours from a free game, enjoying the beautiful graphics, relaxing Diablo-like gameplay and variety in its story. The first continent is the standard medieval knights one, but there are also continents based on steampunk or Kung Fu movies, to name but two. All having the same Diablo-like gameplay. But in Diablo, missions (\"kill everything in an area\") would take half an hour or so, here every mission (\"kill everything\", \"collect something while killing everything\") usually takes a few minutes at most. And then you get a new goal, without any backtracking, because thoughtfully the original quest giver asked you to report to the next for your reward.\\n\\nPay to win? Not at all, if you play it like me. I have not felt the slightest inclination to buy anything. Even your inventory is enormously large, something most MMOs (especially free ones) often limit. And it seems that the economy is aimed fully at the upper levels (that I will never reach). At lower levels, quest rewards might be 200 silver coins, while rewards for simply logging in might be 100,000 silver coins. So as a low-level player, you feel richer than can be expected. You also get a mount very early in the game.\\nI am thinking about spending some real-world money as a \\'thank you\\' to the developers, but I honestly wouldn\\'t know what I should buy with that money.\\n\\nIs there nothing to complain about? Well, you are very limited in how your character looks, when you don\\'t pay for a \\'skin\\'. And I would have liked it if the view was zoomed-out a bit more. And the balancing is a bit off: some of the many systems are introduced (via optional quests) way before they make sense (like optimising your gear while you are still finding better stuff every 10 minutes). Some are introduced before they can even be completed. Like asking me at level 30 to craft something for which I needed gold; I got my first gold at level 50.\\n\\nSo if you go into this game with the aim of spending hundreds of hours on end-game content, look for another review. I see several negative reviews from players with THOUSANDS of hours. But if you are like me, getting 60 hours of fun mindless click-click action for free is good value for money.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After almost 1700 hours in the game I call it quits. Lost Ark is a beautitful game with great combat, unique and fun classes but some systems and mechanics just ruin everything and take all the fun away. I played the endgame and have an army of tier 3 alts but it still doesn't change the basic problems with LA.\\n\\nI hung in there since launch and I've been close to quitting more times but I really so much wanted the game to be a success but decision after decion out of my reach have reduced those chances little by little until I've reached the point where I am today. No more..I want to find a game where I can have fun and not be so frustrated over one unrewarding system after the other. I don't need another job, I want to relax and have a good time, something that has been less and less of the last months.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake is not AGS/SG's fault but I miss having the community feeling. The type of players it attracts don't seem to have a gamers's heart or be (oldtime) mmo players but just random players who want to play and be rewarded fast without any effort. So while it previously was fun taking my army of alts into hardmode content and Argos and earn a nice amount of gold (at least I felt rewarded for all the time and gold I put into them), completely disappeared with the influx of 1370 from one day to another when the power- and hyperpasses were out at the end of July.\\nThe amount of selfish players who don't care about others, nor their own char or the gameplay just piled up until it started being a nightmare and another job to do those hardmodes. Where I could run a dungeon in 10 min before now takes maybe an hour with repetitive wipes because people can't be bothered to gear up their class with sufficent engravings or spend 2 min on watching a video about the mechanics. They expect however others to do  the work instead. Another fun feature that turned into a bitter chore.\\n\\nThe honing system was always a big thorn in my eyes. I accepted how frustrating it was for some time but after 6 months I'm so tired of being on an emotional rollercoaster over an unrewarding system that only has one purpose: to sour up your game time. The few successes you have cannot cover up for all the times you were utterly frustrated over the amount of mats, gold and time you channelled into this system.\\n\\nAbility stones  - another awful system where you have to play casino and maybe win. If not you can go – like my friend just did – and spend 35k gold on getting pheons to buy new ability stones because they kept failing. Who in their right mind design a system that only wants to grieve their players? Stones should never cost anything but gold and the 9 pheons we just had from the event feels more like an insult to the face than anything else. Sometimes I even get a suspicion that the playerbase it being tested. How far can AGS/SG go..how much will the playerbase put up with?!\\n\\nClasses being deliberatedly slow-dripping released  - is another mind buggling decision.\\nI get it – AGS/SG want to milk the game for as much as they can as long as they can  - but the arrogance behind is that they automatically assume everyone to have been on a super hype about the game right from the get go and expect players to be there for years and hence wait for more classes.\\nI only got to know LA right before the launch and despite I'm overall quite content with my bard (and other classes that I've played) I would of course have liked to try out the rest of the classes. However there is nothing that speaks for why I should wait around for a year until all classes from other regions are coming to our version.\\nThat AGS/SG are refraining from giving the West all the classes there are in other regions just feels like another punishement or extremely bad planning – no excitement here about it. AGS/SG took that away already. It's just another annoying issue.\\n\\nIf AGS/SG want to earn dollars and euros so badly they should have done their homework better and prepared all the skins from other regions, so they were ready for the western version already from launch but LA West was skin starved and still is. Players have been literally begging for more skins in the cash shop over the months. Tons of opportunities wasted! \\n\\nGold – somehow it seems there is enough of it for every gamer (in tier 3) if you put time and effort into it but those extraordinary limitations like removing gold from rapporting in starting tiers and limits to the amount of chars (currently max 6) who can earn gold seem so controlling and unnecessary. Why punish the players when AGS/SG should find more permanent solutions against botters and RMTers instead? Why take away the few things which could have sweetened up the game for all players, who have to put up with an otherwise very punishing systems. \\nAlso give me the freedom to level and run as many chars as I please. Let me earn more gold, if I put the time and effort into leveling up the chars.\\nThe direction AGS/SG is taking to solve illegal gaming always involves more limitations and less enjoyment for the normal players these days.\\n\\nI really don't know what kind of expert team that has been supervising the development of these LA systems but basically the premise in this game is the more the player suffer to achieve anything the better. It's supposed to motivate you. Maybe it works for some but not for me.\\nMaybe it's a cultural difference between Koreans, Russians and the West but there is no way I feel more fullfillment, excitement or enjoyment in the game  by being exposed to punishing mechanics on a daily basis. It's only aggravating and demotivating.\\n\\nThe game has some sweet features like Sailing, Strongholds, Adventure tome exploring, Rapporting, Mokoko hunting etc. etc. but they are sadly all minor and can't cover up for the big unfullfilling feeling and lack of joy the rest of the game gives you.\\n\\nI'm sure I'm gonna miss parts of LA and I will keep an eye out for LA over the next year but for now my adventure ends. I've really got my money's worth of it but enough is enough.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game started off amazing.  Huge playerbase, everyone was learning the mechs, and the combat was absolutely seamless. No class felt super overpowered and all was right. However, the grind is incredibly tedious. Daily tasks are absolutely mind-numbingly boring and repetitive. I've played almost every day since launch and I wouldn't recommend to start playing now. Inflation is skyrocketing and it's impossible for new players to catch up. Progression  is limited by so many currencies and materials that you'll always encounter some sort of barrier, whether it be gold, silver, shards, or honing materials. Running low on currency? Sell your materials. But wait, if you sell your materials, how will you progress? You can't. \\nWant to play a DPS? Good luck, the giga whale who's 40 levels above you will always be accepted first, and you'll be stuck in a waiting lobby praying for a support to join your room. \\nRaids are fun, but if one person keeps messing up the mechanics, all fun is lost. Overall, the game was incredible at first, but absolutely piss-poor now. Combat and graphics are still incredible, though.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It is important to start with that I do not review games. Though I am making an exception for Lost Ark. \\n\\nMany players found they either started the game due to hype, friends asking them to join, or they had been tracking it since its Korean and Russian release. Once you start playing the game it is simple enough the combat system is kind of similar to ARPGS, not new but something different. This is where many players will praise the game for combat being smooth and refreshing. You level quickly enough and the dungeons seem fun as you progress a B list story. You are awed and impressed with the in game visuals and the feeling that you\\'re making progress. Then you hit 50 and everything shifts ever so slightly. You now are at Vern and you have shifted away from gathering gear to honing the same set. Nothing too drastic, the mats are not awful and the success rates are 100%. North Vern is now completed and for the first time you get a notification that you must hit a certain gear level before you can progress, something is starting to feel off but you can not put your finger on it. You manage to gather mats with daily quests that are very repetitive, running chaos dungeons which are mat pinatas, and you play around on islands or do events that have no real purpose other than to get you more mats/shinies.\\n\\nAfter a decent effort you finally hit the required gear level and you have felt the sting of the honing failures but it is still not overly painful. You get to Rohendal and you feel even more like something is off, things you got in the habit of doing now are just not able to be done any more. You can not really gather Makoko seeds as easily and starting to realize the fun combat is starting to feel a tad repetitive. Another notification that you must further hone your gear and this is when that feeling starts to actually manifest into something tangible. Your gathering mats for a chance to improve your gear and the success rate is dropping rapidly. You ask around for methods on how best to gather these mats and are told this is an Alt friendly game. So you spin up some alts, burn those two nice Vern power passes and have two more level 50 characters at your disposal. That feeling grows even stronger, each of these new toons also needs to hone gear, but why did you already spend weeks doing it on the first character you made. So you start gathering mats on them to pass to your Main, only to find out not all materials are roster bound, that seems like a problem. Now you\\'re logging in daily on multiple characters to gather the mats that are tradeable and after you have enough you spin the honing wheel to lose most of them.\\n\\nNow you\\'re finally on your way to Yorn, you soldier through it because by this point you\\'re no longer exploring islands or doing much else than gathering materials to keep your gear score going up. Vindication, you get a new set of gear that causes that very strong feeling to finally be put into a word \"Dread\". The game is no longer hiding that almost everything is RNG, especially honing which is a mandatory exercise you can not escape. Also the frustration starts to build as you realize those alts can no longer help gain materials because they are still Tier 1 and can not help you anymore. Do you grind them up to help with Tier 2 or do you focus only on that one character. Tier 2 honing is just as rough as Tier 1 and you\\'re doing it again with higher material requirements. By the time you hit Feiton you have come to understand nothing else in this game matters as much as gathering materials to fail at honing your gear. \\n\\nThe promise of great things to come is what your peers tell you while the developers tell you to go at your own pace. The dungeons are kind of pointless now because they are just there to do once or twice for low amounts of honing materials. Say you finally get your character to the coveted Tier 3, guess what you\\'re starting the gear honing grind again and now it is even worse than before. If you want to log in every day for login rewards, do dailies religiously, participate in events only there to feed your material addiction, and just repeatedly get told your feelings are wrong. Maybe Lost Ark is for you. Spelling out these things is only to encapsulate the reality that the publisher/developers decided for greed or ignorance to force NA/EU to toil in Tier 1 and Tier 2 for now. All you have to do is watch videos from Korea and see that this is not what new players on those servers experience. The focus is to get players to Tier 3 so they can all enjoy the same content together and not telling them to play at their own pace. Yes there are Pay to Win aspects, but everyone says it can be avoided with time and the game does not force you to do that if you\\'re willing to stick with it.\\n\\nBetween an underdeveloped community that can be toxic only a month in and some of the worst game support you will ever experience for an MMO. The Western Lost Ark NA/EU release is horrible. Yes there is something that could be great about this game, but that is not what was delivered, and right now there is no road map for it to get where other regions already are. The largest issue I have experienced is the honing rates and it is clear the publisher/developer are not willing to address this because that is not the vision they have for NA/EU.\\n\\nI recommend to anyone considering this game \"Do Not Waste your Time\". Three hundred hours in and a good chunk of money spent to try to support a game that promised to be everything it is not right now. Sure the game could become great just like other regions, it is not currently, and the longer folks stay or keep joining will only further encourage the continuation of the horrible state that is in major need of improvements. At this point it is obvious that NA/EU are getting the worst version this game has to offer. I understand this was long and thank you to those that made it to the end.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'After almost 830 hours, hear me out. \\n\\nThe game started off solid. to be honest, the content was a little overwhelming and I loved it. The combat was a breath of fresh air in terms of MMO combat systems. \\n\\nHowever, the grind is very real. I think this has to be the most grindiest game I\\'ve ever played, and usually that isn\\'t a problem for me. But the rewards for said grind just don\\'t feel worth it. Everyone says the real game starts at level 50 and an iLvl of 250, and that is very true. But it never ends. From that point on the game becomes one huge grind fest to increase your iLvl and it HAS to be done. Content in this game is gated behind iLvl, from certain horizontal activities to end game dungeon content.\\n\\nAgain, it wouldn\\'t be so bad but this game relies on a \"Honing\" system that requires materials, gold and silver to increase the power and iLvl of your gear. Materials, gold and silver are not plentiful unless you spend cash. The success rate of these hones decreases significantly the higher you go, to the point that you eventually are given the upgrade because you\\'ve failed so many times. Can it be done? Of course, with an extreme amount of time invested. But this game heavily leans towards P2W. Not in the traditional sense, you don\\'t actually win anything, but in the sense that you feel like you HAVE to pay to progress. \\n\\nAt ILvl 1400, the end game is extremely lackluster. You get 1 raid that can be done once a week. 2 dungeons that can be done once a week, 2 chaos dungeons (main source of honing materials that actually don\\'t give you anywhere near enough materials to actually hone successfully) twice a day for rewards and a guardian raid (another source of materials) once a day (for rewards).\\n\\nIn the end, I found myself logging in, doing my dailies and logging out into an alt (needed to do dailies so that you can \"feed\" your main with materials)\\n\\nIF you have no issues swiping that card, by all means, play this game. If that isn\\'t your style, you can certainly progress, just at a much, MUCH slower pace. \\n\\nIt was fun while it lasted, but unless something changes in terms of available resources, reduced honing costs, more end game content and engaging horizontal progression, I won\\'t be coming back. \\n\\nOh. And bots. Bots. BOTS. This game is flooded with them to  the point you\\'ll see 100 bots to every 1 real player.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Although I had a high number of hours in the game, I want to say at least half that was spent idling the game in one form or another, since it doesn\\'t auto-close if you trigger the afk disconnect. \\n\\nI\\'ve uninstalled it for three reasons: \\n\\n1) AGS sucks. AGS protecting our wallets is a meme in the community because they are so slowly releasing more of the (I\\'m not kidding) hundreds of skins present in the South Korean version of the game. The company devoted themselves fully to dripfeeding the worst looking skins in the entire catalog, 1-2 per month, long term.\\n\\n2) The bot problem is so out of control, it\\'s just as infested as Runescape 2 was by bots in 2005-2006. Bots in Lost Ark swarm like locusts clustering together across the starting areas of the game and the major cities zooming around with their speedhacks along the same paths. They also spam advertisements in area chat, which happens to be the one chat where anyone bothers to say anything, so you have to put up with the spam and blocking and reporting to see any human conversations in the game. \\n\\nLife skills as a result of the bot population are close to worthless. Infinite chaos dungeons are a very boring alternative for making more gold and I\\'m certainly not swiping my credit card to progress faster either. Let me put infinite chaos dungeons to you this way: some people I\\'ve spoken with ingame have described grinding them out as \"brain melting\". Others claimed it was a guaranteed road to burning out. Lost Ark players reading this may counter, \"If you need gold, just make alts!\". I\\'m getting to that.\\n\\n3) The gameplay loop is so simple and stale. If you make 6 characters, expect 2.5-3 hours of chaos dungeons and guardian raids you\\'ve already done, every single day or every 3 days if you want to get optimal gold and material gains. Argos will add even more time to your weekly quota, though it will get easier in the future as people outgear him. If reset day came and you aren\\'t running 6 1370 characters, lord help you, it\\'s time to spam abyssal dungeons which are a massive time sink across 6 alts even if you party finder for varying reasons. Maybe your teammates don\\'t understand mechanics. Maybe party finder is slow during your time of play. Maybe your teammates just want to make everyone sit through cutscenes (which require a unanimous vote to skip). If you think like me, someone who simply cannot play games in as a casual for very long, you have to play more than 3 hours a day if you want to go participate in the other content in the game, like quests, or the many collectibles or even the time gated islands that only appear a few times a day. \\n\\nIt is so easy to burn out with the current gameplay loop that even Smilegate\\'s own past statistics reflect a massive decrease in the South Korean playerbase during their version of this era of the game (pre-Legion Raids). Smilegate must have made a lot of money back then to force the Western regions to experience the same hellish era. \\n\\n* In writing this review, I came to realize a fourth reason I\\'m done playing the game. \\n\\n4) Waiting 3 days is possible because of rested bonus, which the community generally considers time-efficient. I was obligated to ask myself after waiting for rested bonuses enough times on my alts, \"Why am I waiting 3 days to play a game on a specific character?\". My answer took shape as, \"The game is almost like a bad job, the chores are so tedious\". I have never encountered another mmorpg to make me feel so bored. If I got bored in BDO, for example, I could go ride my turbo horse around the region, I could go fish, I could jump my Tamer mount off mountains for fun. If I got bored in Runescape, I could play minigames, something Runescape did best. If I got bored in Path of Exile, I could make a new build, run special maps or decorate my hideout extensively. \\n\\nLost Ark\\'s side activities are nowhere near as entertaining as the ones I\\'ve encountered in other mmos, except for PVP. Smilegate\\'s game is so extraordinarily barebones when it comes to its fun activities that I feel like it meets the bare minimum requirements to pass as a game outside of its dailies. It feels like a very poorly made skinner box. Legion Raids will improve upon my complaints but not enough to bring me back. Miraculously, Smilegate\\'s mmorpg convinced me to look for enjoyment in my creative hobbies again.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Uh I have played Lost Ark for 3500 hours, So this will be an interesting/ HONEST review.  The game is closing in on 1 year old for NA/EU so keep this in mind as I speak my opinion about this game.....\\n\\nWhere to start..... Lost Ark was a game that I had first seen a gameplay trailer for KR back in like 2015, me and the squad were SOOOO HYPE about this game I cannot lie. Was this the Diablo killer we were waiting to play? Years down the road we now have it in our hands getting to experience a game that has been out for years before us.\\n\\nWhen first playing Lost Ark at launch the \"magical feeling\" was present - kinda like a honey moon phase per say. The phase where everything was exciting, new, and fresh. Your homies were all in it, hype af and ready to play every moment they got a chance to! Right???  Ya well that phase lasted about 2 -3 months because the daily chores you feel obligated to do dissolves that feeling away shortly after you reach the tip of endgame and start the REAL grind. You would think new updates and new classes introduced to the game would help ease the unexciting and dull dailies you do to keep up with the current content would rejuvenate the freshness ...... Nah sadly if it does its very short lived - To even get a new character caught up with the pack is a grind. Powerpass, Hyperpass, Expresspass, Punicapass, Megapass, Ultrapass, Gigapass!!!! Doesnt matter how its worded its still all a tedious grind to the top - \"The Hamster wheel keeps turning\" as my best friend likes to tease us few still playing...... lol\\n\\nListen I genuinely enjoy Lost ark and everything it presents - I also genuinely dislike a lot of things that it brings. I will just touch on a few from each side.\\n\\nWhats good ? \\n- Gameplay. -  Lost Ark has some of THE BEST raiding content I have ever been a part of. It doesn\\'t get much better then this currently. Lost Ark has some on THE BEST visuals from a game running on an old engine. UE3 I think? Lost Ark has some of THE BEST Character Identities I have seen In a game recently. \\n\\n- Mass amount of content -   Lost ark has a   C R A P  ton of content available to players from start to finish. Like more then I am personally WILLING to go hunt for,  track down, and complete. Like its a lot!!!!! \\n\\n\\nWhats Bad ?\\n*Some of this will be hard to put in words to where others who might not have played it yet or play its as much will understand.* \\n\\n- The games Core Design - \\nOk, Lost Ark is VERY VERY poorly designed to introduce and bring in new players..... I feel like once the game reached a specific amount of content added to the base game,  it is now EXTREMELY hard on new players/characters to be mixed in with the current pool of players who have been playing since launch. \\n\\nAll the shear amount of intricate things needed to be \"Accepted\" in the raiding scene, (which is the biggest highlight of Lost Ark dont forget!!!) is near impossible for new players to obtain and jump in with friends or even experience the game properly...... New Account? Low Roster level? \"Nope\"  gatekept!  Character doesnt have all +lvl7 gems or higher? \"nope\" gatekept! Your character is level 52.45 not max level 60?! \"Nope\" gatekept!  You dont have Grudge lvl3 ? \"Nope\" GATEKEPT! You dont have 5x3 BiS engravings? \"Nope\" G A T E K E P T.  Keep in mind this is just a handful of many more problems this game has when it comes to the Vertical content pushing, every single one of these issues isn\\'t like you can get all these fixed in 24hours - No its a grind. Month at BEST for a new player maybe even longer..... I mean unless you swipe...... Legally or Illegally  and Im not opening that flood gate...... -_-\\n\\nI dont blame the people who are gatekeeping - I blame the way the game is designed and its poor in many ways on that note. \"Great Vision - Poor Delivery\" \\n\\n- Anti-Cheat system - \\nThe anti-cheat system used in the NA Version of Lost Ark is so bad its sad. Like Depressingly Sad. not sure how else to put it. \\n\\n- Bots - \\nBots run Rampant in the game, Amazon has yet to figure out a solution to clean it up and remove them in our version of the game. So it genuinely sours the early to mid gameplay experiences new players have when they have their first play through....... You will see many  characters named Yyyggdsfdfghesfdf running around on horseback with the new mokoko tag next to their name stating they are a fresh account. Yep. -_- What makes this a sticky fix, is the fact that this is Free to Play, you can ban wave thousands of bots - give them 48 hours and they are sprawling back to farm up gold. \\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day Lost Ark is a Dope game, that has A LOT of room to grow in the western client. But also has a lot of problems that get swept under the rug with greedy game design. I also understand this game is developed by another culture and that\\'s partly just a way of life in some parts of the world. But I also can play a game for almost 4k hours and see glaring holes that need to be fixed or filled to boost a games integrity from a player base POV. \\n\\nIts really hard to give an Honest review like this when you have invested time like this in a game. But for what its worth, I give this game a 6/10 ONLY because it has so much good going for it. If AGS and Smilegate would genuinely crack down on the problems and commit to the issues the game has my review and rating would be vastly different. \\n\\nHope this helps people who have never played but also people who are still currently playing for better or for worse. \\n\\nHappy Holidays - SlimB',\n",

It is an incredibly good game with all of the necessary components to compete with the monsters in the MMO genre but the Smilegate and Amazon just seem to be making all the wrong decisions.\\n\\nBefore you judge my review, keep in mind as of the date of this review (6/14/2022) I am roster lvl 172, most horizontal content done and have a 1460, 1420, 1385x2, 1370 x2, and 4 1340\\'s. Cleared all content available in the game on the week released and am entirely free to play minus cosmetics for my character, battle pass and some founder packs. The amount of time and effort i\\'ve put in to stay at currently released content is staggering as you can see by my hours.\\n\\nIF the issues I list below, specifically the botting/RMT issues, see fixes or adjustments this game is absolutely worth playing... but I don\\'t see them recovering from this one.\\n\\n1. Bots\\n\\nI have played a ton of MMO\\'s ranging from dead to prosperous, f2p and subscription based. All of them have bot issues, but nothing like this. I wish I was exaggerating when I say this game easily has 500k+ bots if not more but i\\'m not. It has destroyed the in game economy and made que\\'s to even log in 10,000-20,000 long. The devs are barely slapping the wrist of RMT purchasers and do roughly once a month ban waves targeting bots that accomplish nothing. I know it isn\\'t an easy thing to fix, no MMO has... but their attempts have only damaged the game play of real players whilst leaving a minor annoyance to the botting community.\\n\\n\\n2. The Grind\\n\\nInitially I was super pleased with the middle ground this game has, most KR MMO\\'s have systems in which gear downgraded or completely deleted if it was to fail an upgrade. Lost Ark has the happy medium of doing neither whilst provided a fail stack that guarantees you will successfully upgrade after enough fails. It still leaves in the gamble RNG dopamine hits without having infinite punishment. Sounds great right? It was... until you realize you either have to run 6+ characters to feed materials to your main to make any meaningful progress or simply swipe your credit card. EVERYTHING is time gated other than MSQ. Anything that provides materials for upgrade honing is locked behind daily/weekly content. Normally this doesn\\'t bother me but the amount of materials you receive daily in the end game is barely enough for one very low chance click a day with a few more on weekly reset. Without moderate luck you will go nowhere without tons of alt characters.\\n\\n\\n3. The leadership and communication of AGS and SGS.\\n\\nTheir communication is abysmal. They just can\\'t seem to do it... It\\'s gotten a little better in terms of talking to us about things but it\\'s a stretch to even get patch notes or an hour heads up on emergency maintenance\\'s with little to no compensation of any kind let alone an apology. In the beginning the lead developer openly stated he wanted all regions to catch up to KR as soon as possible (Korea has vastly more content than us at the moment as it was released years ago there), they have broke this promise dozens of times already in major ways. The community has collectively asked for more skin releases, more class releases faster, and all sorts of basic things along those lines in which they claimed they heard us and are working on it. Their solution? Release an RNG lootbox skin that on average takes $700 USD to complete, 1 skin a month that is hand selected from the worst selling skins in other regions and changing class releases from once a month to one every 2 months. Keep in mind ALL of this content we are asking for is ALREADY in the game in multiple other regions, it requires 0 development only localization. They openly admitted that their decision for some of these changes were based off of purely what would make them the most money as they are \"Valuable moments for us.\" I\\'m all for a company making money, especially if they deserve it, but they have lost millions basing their decisions off of business analytics where they misread the data. Out of all the MMO\\'s i\\'ve played this one\\'s leadership is by FAR the worst i\\'ve encountered. A huge majority of their decisions are made on milking money from players which in turn is backfiring and causing them to lose vastly more than by just doing the right thing.\\n\\n\\nThere are many other minor issues but they hail in comparison to the 3 above. However, the major 3 are so severe that it\\'s just a deal breaker straight up for the community. Lost Ark had so much promise and can still be turned around... At it\\'s core it\\'s still one of my favorite MMO\\'s I have ever played. Amazing combat, raids, systems, and immersive world with a below average story (It does get better way later in the game!) Steer clear of this one though unless this is farther in the future and these problems have been addressed to some degree, in which case I would wholeheartedly recommend this game 100%.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read my review and I wish you luck finding a game for you.\\n\\n**Edit: Some spelling/grammar changes.',\n",

       "  'review': 'On 3-2-2022 I received a permanent ban on Lost Ark for Commerce Lock.\\n\\nThe reason I was told I received this ban was due to a refund of a steam purchase I had made of the Founders pack of Lost Ark before the game Launched for early head start. Purchase was originally made in August of 2021 and Refunded on Jan 30th 2022.  I have screen Shots of all mentioned transactions.\\n\\nThe reason I did this refund was because I was trying to decided on which founders pack was of the most value to me and could provide the most benefit.  I ended up deciding the next day Jan 31st to purchase all packs offered (Including the Founders Pack I was Banned For) and I continued to purchase all available packs that were released after. \\n\\nThis ban should be reversed as customers like myself who not only did not realize we were doing a ban able offence, but as well a lot of players have invested money into your game with all packs, gems, etc. \\n\\nIt is unfair and unjust practice to be banned from playing due to mistakes on refunds, especially when those refunds were issued before your game was released and players never received in-game items.\\n\\nI have never had a ban on any of my 400+ steam games and I am highly disappointed that Amazon Game Studios was the first.

       "  'review': 'Since I only have about 10 hours sunk into the game so far and I am very much so in \"early-game\" still, I would like to chime in on the concerns/complaints that I am seeing around Lost Ark in its early stages... Now, as far as pacing goes, if you decide to play the game for free, it is quite slow. I noticed that almost immediately. Personally I am not against a slower pace as I prefer to take my time with things - I am the kind of guy that actually reads the text when I am doing quests - so for me that is not an issue. The story so far is captivating and interesting in my book so that helps tremendously with the slow pacing of the game. The art style is very typical Korean/Japanese/Asian so if you are not a fan of that, probably best to stay away - though you might enjoy it regardless. I personally LOVE the style of art and the visuals are crazy good in Lost Ark, especially the abilities of the classes. \\n\\nWhilst my opinion is of course subject to change as time goes on, there is no harm in trying this game - since it is free - and giving it a shot if you are on the fence about it.',\n",

Run back and forth between 100 mobile game currency trade-in NPCs to collect your daily scraps.\\n6. Don\\'t get enough materials to even do a single upgrade.\\n7. Repeat step 1 through 6 on the 5 Alts that the game economy expects you to invest your time in, shove all upgrade materials to your main.\\n8. Have materials for 1-2 upgrade attempts on your main now, fail both because sub-30% success chance.\\n9. \"Ah man, let\\'s have some fun raids now after all these chores and disappointments.\" Oops, weekly entry limit exceeded. Only 1 entry allowed.\\n10. \"Ah no problem, I\\'ll just need a couple more item levels so I can access the next raid in...\" *takes out calculator* \"6 weeks or swiping my credit card for 2000€, nice!\"\\n11. Twiddle your thumbs as you wait for daily reset to repeat the exact same braindead content on 6 characters again, hoping that RNGesus might hear your prayers tomorrow while hating your life.\\n\\nThis game timegates EVERYTHING. Every single thing you can do is extremely timegated and they even go as far as to stretch out your daily chores by timegating fast travelling, so you better plan around that or have some cash ready to remove the timelock from your fast travel. It\\'s absolutely the most insane shit I\\'ve ever seen in a non-mobile game. \\n\\nAnd the worst thing about this is, that despite all the time gating, it still doesn\\'t respect your time. You can spend all your free time on the same mindless crap with pitiful rewards and still get absolutely nowhere.\\n\\nReally disappointing, because the game\\'s combat system and world design are genuinely beautiful.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh dear,\\n\\nI\\'ve been waiting for the game since the first video of the Closed Beta Test in Korea. Was so hyped about MOBA-like action RPG about a tripod system making it an ultimate skill-based MMORPG.\\n\\nThe first [b]10 hours[/b] start like with every other MMORPG game, you make your character and progress through the story. The problem is when the story is just [b]G spam[/b] clickfest and a walk from NPC to NPC, with tons of fetch quests in between.\\n\\nAfter [b]15 hours[/b] when you reach the 1st main city, you are unlocking the first [b]Chaos Dungeons[/b], and after some time [b]Abyssal Dungeons[/b]. The first one you can do only [b]two times[/b] per day for rewards, Abyssal Dungeons are once per week.\\n\\nThey are telling you that you don\\'t need alts to progress, so I did 5 alts so 6 classes in total. I was progressing 6 times faster than my other guildmates. I can only imagine that someone living in a 20square apartment playing video games 17 hours a day can progress 12times faster than me, you get the point.\\n\\n[b] At 200 hours mark [/b], I had 6 characters in T2 and one character in T3 content (tiers are like levels of content you are currently on)\\n\\n[b]My daily routine was:[/b]\\n\\n- run 2x chaos dungeon on 6 characters (6mins each)\\n- run 3x una daily tasks on 6 characters (5mins each)\\n- run 1x daily island (10-15mins each)\\n- run 1x daily chaos or boss run (10-15 mins each)\\n\\nand I was doing this [b]EVERY... SINGLE... DAY... :[/b] since the early access.\\n\\nI finally reached the level of 1st \"hard content\" called [b]Abyssal Raids[/b].\\nAfter clearing an Argos P1 in 5 mins I realized how dumb I was chasing the carrot that kept saying to me: it will be better later on...\\n\\nEnd game of Lost Ark looks like this:\\n1. You do the dailies until you can clear raids.\\n2. Clearing raids leave you with locked content until next week, so you are left with repetitive daily una tasks and chaos dungeons, that are brainless mob clearing grindy runs.\\n3. Do the horizontal progress (collectables)\\n4. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\nSo when the fun starts?\\n\\nWell, after you grind your way to the hardest content you can play, its about 20 to 30 mins of [b]FUN[/b] content per week, per chracter. So you can figure it out by youself.\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning in huge TLDR:\\n\\n- you can buy materials off the cash shop\\n- you can buy gold off the cash shop\\n- you can basically buy anything from cash shop even boost of characters (in future releases)\\n- BOTS BOTS BOTS (yeah that much a repetitive content is perfect for automatization, so there are bots destroying econemy every single day)\\n- to be efficient, you have to fit your life schedule to the game, as horizontal progress is time gated, at a specified time of the day/night)\\n\\n[h1] HOWEVER [/h1] [i]ending words... [/i]\\n\\nThe version of the game we\\'ve got was the worst one from KR. The game looks good and the diversity of the characters and their playstyles makes it like you almost want to play the game. PVP is balanced as its gear is equalized. English dubbing isn\\'t that bad (I\\'ve seen worse), and despite all those negatives above, I can tell that If the game gets more and more updates, It might make the review end in a positive way, but for now it\\'s a huge NO for me.\\n\\nI don\\'t recommend the game... for now.\\n\\nEDIT 23.04.2022: Formatting.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So after over 500+ hours, playing 9 characters daily &\\' almost having 6 characters in T3 i have to say that:\\nIf u enjoy a really grindy game that rewards you for playing ALOT of alts to get your main character faster up &\\'\\nyou don\\'t mind failing upgrades hundreds of times you are probably right here.\\n\\nIf you hate grinding &\\' want/need instant gratification, this game is probably not the right one for you.\\n\\nFor me this game feels like a mix between World of Warcraft, Diablo3, FFXIV &\\' BDO together.\\nWhat i mean by that is that it has the Combat system &\\' also Rifts like Diablo3 (Chaos in dungeons in Lost Ark);\\nBeing able to be a Completionist &\\' farm different kind of Collectibles and Trade skills like World of Warcraft;\\n\"Hard\" &\\' challenging Content (in the future actual hard content;Legion Commander Raids) like from Final Fantasy\\nAND of course the Aesthetic style, Cash shop &\\' a few other things like from BDO.\\n\\nSo in the end would i recommend the game?\\nWell yeah, i do enjoy it, so i would definitely recommend it if u like a grindy mmo!\\nBut remember its an mmorpg, u shouldnt \"beat/finish\" the game with minimum effort &\\' time spent.\\nTheres no need for FOMO (Fear of missing out), u will eventually be able to play the content, u dont have to\\nwhale (cash) in order to get there, if u put in time &\\' effort you can also get there, but if u cant handle that people\\ncan get there faster with spending money, maybe u should take some time fresh air.\\nSince even in real life u have advantages if u have alot of money, so be stupid &\\' enjoy your time!\\n\\nUpdate after 2k+ hours: i stepped up my game from playing 9 characters to playing 24+ &\\' i still love the game :)',\n",

       "  'review': '// OUTDATED: I don\\'t play Lost Ark anymore, it takes way too much time to get to anywhere if you don\\'t spend a lot of money on it.\\n\\n\\nWithin the past few days I\\'ve read hundreds of Lost Ark reviews on Steam, out of curiosity and... it\\'s exactly how I thought it\\'d be when the game started to be free to play. Number of shitty reviews that occurred since then is ridiculous. Whereas positive ones don\\'t tell you anything about the game and just fill up the space in reviews tab, people that gave the game negative review made me want to write a review myself. I haven\\'t read such bullshit about any game in years, so let me try to put things straight. \\n\\nFirstly, I would like to say that I\\'m not a huge fan of Lost Ark, just so you don\\'t call me fanboy defending his favorite game. Despite my playtime on Steam, I haven\\'t been playing the game as long and as much as other \"veterans\" from KR/RU. Although I started months before Lost Ark was even announced to be released in EU/NA, I played the game for only 1100+ hours. That\\'s maybe 2 hours a day on average but I still think it\\'s enough and it\\'s way more than majority of peoples\\' playtime here. Also, most of my playtime is from RU version which is considered the most \"pay to win\" version out of all.\\n\\nBefore full release the game had overwhelmingly positive reviews (96-98% positive from closed alpha/closed beta) and now it fluctuates around 70%.\\nLost Ark was (and still is) a very hyped MMO. People expected much. I think too much. If you are just a bit clever you should know that there could be problems with launching the game, especially when it\\'s an MMO genre. Not to mention that publisher in our region was AGS.\\n\\nMost of negative reviews are from people that are crying about queues, bad story, the game being \"pressing G simulator\" or petty problems that can be fixed within few minutes using Google. Maybe 2-3% of all reviews have any sense and are worth reading. The rest is trash. It\\'s picking apart you could do with any other MMO. Here are some very popular statements that people keep repeating over and over in their garbage reviews, just so you know and don\\'t spread shitword all over again:\\n\\n1. The game is made on UE3 - it is, so what? Everyone says the game starts to look outdated - ok, it\\'s subjective. Some people can say the graphics are bad, others can say the graphics are good, but why nobody mentions animations which are excellent or the fact that the game is extremely well optimized? You can run this game on potato, I\\'m having 100+ FPS on Ryzen 5 3600 & GTX 1660 Ti on very high settings in every area/dungeon/raid. You can\\'t have it all. Decide what\\'s more important to you - graphics or playability. Lost Ark to this day still looks good and runs even better.\\n\\n2. The game is P2W - show me at least one mechanic in this game which is pay to win. I think peoples\\' definition of P2W in 2022 equals to \"I can spend money on a game so the game is pay to win\". The game is pay for progress/pay for convenience, there\\'s like nothing you can get for real money but can\\'t get for money in-game. PvP content is equalized so your item level doesn\\'t matter. The only content that might be considered as pay to win are GvG \\'cause gear actually matters but nobody will buy you knowledge or skill (and you don\\'t have to attend GvG at all, it\\'s optional).\\n\\n3. The story is boring as hell - it is, you\\'re right. But let\\'s be honest, who cares about story in MMO? Despite the fact that story is boring as hell, there are still some cutscenes that are touching or actually well made (and you can\\'t skip them). If you really want to play MMO mainly for plot then run FF14, unless you can name any other MMO with decent story.\\n\\n4. The game is pressing G simulator - it is, you\\'re right. But if you\\'re out of the woods and finish tutorial, it changes. There is no spamming \"G\" for 10 hours in a row with zero other activities anymore. You can do whatever you want. I must admit that leveling process gets dull very fast and is a huge mistake but name me any other MMO in which leveling is as entertaining as end game.\\n\\n5. The game is queue simulator/matchmaking simulator - sometimes it is, sometimes it is not. Queue depends on which region/server you play on and when. At night, in the morning or in the afternoon there are barely queues (maybe with little exception for the weekends) so the only problem are evenings. If you have job, move to another region just so you can play without queues anytime or just wait for casuals to quit the game and keep playing on the region you\\'ve started playing before. When it comes to matchmaking - yes, it\\'s laggy most of the time but slowly gets better. We can just hope that litter employes from AGS start doing something to fix it as they did with IS and Aura.\\n\\n6. There is nothing to do in the game - people saying so have no clue what game they are playing or they watched Twitch streamers for too long and don\\'t know where to begin the rush to their idol\\'s item level. There is so much to do that you won\\'t finish the game within several months, even if you played 24/7 on one character. There is a lot of PvE content (Chaos Dungeons, Guardians, Cubes, Towers, Boss Rushes, Abyssal Dungeons, Abyss Raids, Legions, Gates and more), a lot of casual content (sea content, events, islands, Platinum Fields, quests, housing system, collectibles, adventure book, affinity with NPCs, life skills and more) and even some PvP content (equalized arena with rankings, PvP on islands and GvG).\\n\\n7. The combat gets boring very fast - I think the combat system is one of the best when it comes to isometric MMOARPG games. There are different types of skills (direct, aim, hold, timing, preparation, combo, chain) and there are a lot of skills for each class out of which only 8 (in most scenarios) can be put onto skill bars. Additionally, there are runes, gems and tripods that can change the way the skill behaves and so on. Even if you play the same class as your friend, you can vary a lot from them. Every spell and auto attack is also a skillshot, there is no auto aim so if you are bad you can miss everything (except spells like shields for yourself for example). The hitboxes of players and bosses are pretty accurate too.\\n\\nI ran out of space so if you wonder about any other concerns, read my comments down below.\\n\\n\\nAnother conclusion I came to: \\nI think people forgot that games should bring pleasure. Especially MMO games which are no competitive at all (or are very little competitive in comparison to FPS or MOBA games). Nowadays everyone wants to be the very best. Such people watch Asmongold or other popular streamers that spend a lot of money and push themselves to the end game, and then they want to do the same. They completely ignore everything else and forget what they were supposed to do with the game and what\\'s the game about. That\\'s why afterwards we see reviews from people that have 50, 100 or even 200 hours into the game and are bored after getting to X item level. They say they don\\'t enjoy the game but how can they enjoy it if they spent all time doing garbage storyline quests and upgrading their gear for god knows what reason?\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: In my opinion, Lost Ark is one of the best MMOs ever made but published by one of the worst publishers ever seen. The game itself is very good and once you manage to suffer for the first 10-20 hours to get past tutorial, you will probably stay for a while. Sadly, Amazon is responsible for servers and item shop, and they fucked up both of them - servers are laggy, game is sometimes a queue/matchmaking simulator and we don\\'t know what they add to IS in the future. Once the servers are fixed, Lost Ark will probably be top 1 MMO on Steam for months or even years. Content is ready to be released, the game is very polished and refined overall, all classes are very balanced and playable, the game is player friendly and very well optimized and the most important - the game respects your time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Ive never felt so conflicted about a game. Like, as a game its top notch. Ive had fun doing literally everything the game has to offer. The game play is tight, the game runs well, you can tell the game is made with real care and detail. There are things in this game ive never seen in an mmorpg and just a general level of creativeness that genuinely impressed me. The boss fights are an absolute blast and, again, had some basic but creative mechanics that surprised me in the best way.\\n\\nThen...the elephant in the room. Lets cut the shit. The games progression pathway is designed to suck you in. Resources are plentiful. Upgrades fire off without failing. Your personal damage grows MASSIVELY fast after hitting 50 it feels so damn good. However, the farther you get the more you can see plain as day that the systems are designed to frustrate you enough to get you to pay. You run out of readily available resources and have to farm it out but your upgrades are failing now. You put all that work into farming up a pile of resources you might just lose all of if you are unlucky. This game is designed to take all of your time to play optimally and then spit it back in your face to try and get you to pay. The entire loot cycle is just time consuming and the game has no respect for your time. Their only interest is your wallet. They get you hooked early on with how easy it is, how much power you gain, then they stick it to you hard and its honestly predatory.\\n\\nSo do I recommend this game? Its a great game. I loved every minute of my time here, even the story (I dont think its as bad as some would lead you to believe) BUT this is an MMO. A game genera designed to get you invested and keep you their long term. With how loot upgrades works...I just cant bring myself to recommend the game. Its good, ill always play it casually but this will never be a \"Main MMO\" just simply because I dislike wasting my time and this game will shit all over your time and kick you in the ass until your credit card falls out.',\n",

       "  'review': '\\nPros:\\nThe combat in this game is top notch. Its fun, engaging, and there are plenty of classes with very unique gameplay for every gamer. There are plenty of raids (and soon to be more) each being quite different from one another and are challenging. \\n\\nCons: \\n\\nThe downside to the pros is not all classes are released and the publisher/developer decided to slowly release them. Its expected to take almost a year from now to get all the classes currently available in other regions.\\n\\nThe game is addicting. There are dailies and weeklies which pushes players to feel the need to log on. Its not like other games where you can pick up where you left off. You COULD choose to take a break but when you come back you will be time-gated as there are daily/weekly limits to each content. This creates a sense of FOMO and therefore can hook players. \\n\\nThere are a lot of rng in this game. From honing (upgrading) gear to cutting rocks (which provide unique engravings (stats), the disparity between a lucky player and an unlucky player is large. If you were to quantify it in terms of dollars, it would easily be in the thousands. This would be considered a gambling element to this game and therefore to some can be addicting.\\n\\nThere is a huge problem with bots and RMTers, especially on NAW. NAW has queue times at all times of the day but plans have been announced to combat this (who knows if it will be effective). RMTers (people who buy gold illegally, most likely from bots), go un-punished as amazon seems to be turning a blind eye to them. This is unfortunate and unfair to players who either bought gold legitimately in-game or players who no-lifed this game. \\n\\nOverall, I recommend this game as its free to play and you might as well try it out. However, I do think there are more cons than pros to this game currently so it really depends on what you are looking for. These cons are what I find most relevant for myself. The combat and raids are amazing though and is the main reason why I am recommending this as opposed to not recommending it. Hope this was useful~',\n",

       "  'review': \"Lost Ark Review \\n\\nTo preface:  \\n\\nI've played both RU and now NA/E, for Lost Ark at this point (more than 150 hours between the two, in nearly a month). I’ve played WoW since release, and on a number of private servers. I’ve dipped my toes, at least, in many of the MMOs that have released since WOW’s inception – BnS, Tera, Aion, GW2, FFXIV, Destiny, BDO (2 accounts, even), and NW to name a few. This is not at all to say that I’m the voice of MMO experience, but I do have several thousands of hours playing within the genre and affinity for each of the above and others – in their own regard.   \\n\\nOn RU I mostly PvP'd and tested out characters I knew we wouldn't have access to in NA for a genuine taste of the game before it'd arrive, and formulate some idea over what I’d want to play knowing that there would be so many options. \\n\\nTo the Point: \\n\\nI’ve not been able to so consistently enjoy an MMO in years, and I’m having a great time with friends I’ve made along the way – IRL and in game, especially since friends that didn’t head start have been able to access the server being that I’m on one of the more populated NAE servers.  \\n\\nGameplay / Content – it's not re-inventing the wheel. The game is a lot of what we’re used to or have experienced before. What is does it bring... then? Polish. Something that seems relatively lost amid some of the tirades. Obviously, this is anecdotal – but my wait times here, joining right after work during prime time have been grossly under what I experienced with NW or WoW classic/TBC or the recent queue debacle in FFXIV. I’m finding myself a little more interested in the story-telling than usual, given their use of camera angles and other tools alongside what’s in game. It feels like I’m playing my way through a movie, or something in that regard. I was not at all a fan of the isometric view, originally, but with the way it's used I don’t really feel like I’m playing an isometric game. We can meme about the ‘g-simulator’ (just pressing g and spamming our way through quests), but I’d be lying if I didn’t say this was largely my experience with WoW and that it also only changed with time (being able to go from a series of fetch quests and exhaustible map travel like in earlier expansions... to leveling entirely through dungeon or monster grinds, etc – as these weren’t as originally feasible). Additionally, just for doing the MSQs – I get straight to level cap (with as many as 200 quests less than some of my friends and what feels like a lot less back and forth on a horse than what some comments let on), get 2 free character boosts so I don’t have to do it again in the near future, and also have an in-game means to pay for having other alts catch up to that point and not have to repeat it either... I’m not encouraged to spend my real-life cash to avoid it. That’s pretty generous – in my experience and comparing it to other options out there. As well, for a veteran player the level 50-cap can be achieved in around 10 hours – for a newer player (taking into account distractions such as unnecessary side-quests, exploration, cut scene watching, etc.) many of my friends were taking about 20 hours or so, which feels relatively standard. I love the combat options and how we can invest into skills to completely alter them. It feels like we have an acceptable number of options, especially if we’re being objective and making a comparison to something like WoW (some see this as overwhelming, and many also enjoy the myriad of skills – in the scheme of things though, you only largely use a handful while actively doing content and many seldom see use). There’s so much to do, right from the start – which I feel like is another area many of these recent releases have really struggled with...  providing enough content on launch. Especially when you consider that they’re going to have to compete with games like WoW with their more than decade of development/growth and FFXIVs story-telling many many hours of content itself.  \\n\\nI could ramble more at this point I’m certain, but I’ll try to curtail things here. I’m enjoying my time and more than I have in quite some time. \\n\\nTL;DR – It's free – definitely put in the time to see what YOU think, take the leveling experience with a grain of salt... you have options, and depending on those choices you may experience more or less combat and a shorter or longer leveling experience as with many MMOs. Getting to 50, isn’t necessarily when the game starts, but it definitely opens up and offers so much more – and this isn’t server locked, you can group across servers (Chaos Dungeons, Raids, Abyss Dungeons). Personally, I don’t regret my time spent and look forward to further investing.  \\n\\nHope my word vomit helps... someone. If this isn't your game - that's okay, I hope you continue to enjoy your game, and hope people don't tear it down to build up their own namesake.\",\n",

For a casual I would say its better to just find a new game, for those who really like destiny, its not a problem to spend a little extra on additional content.[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th]Content & Replay Value:[/th]\\n        [td]Replay value when it comes to story I would say is close to 0, but the replay value of the pvp and raids are very good. There are at least 100+ hours of quality content here, and much more if you really enjoy the game.[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\\n\\n[h2]Pros[/h2]\\n[b]1.[/b]\\nThe gunplay is fantastic. Guns pack a proper punch. The handling feels solid, and there is nothing better than sniping another guardian in the head. The movement slightly differs from class to class but the mix of dodges and jumps provides more flexibility and a greater skill gap. There are certainly some balancing needed, however all in all I would say the gunplay is great.\\n\\n[b]2.[/b]\\nThe dungeons and raids are a great combination of puzzles, combat, parkour and boss fights. To finish a raid you pretty much have to have a mic and communicate with your team, but as long as your team consists of your friends its gonna be a great time. However, if your team is filled with randoms, prepare for a horrible time.\\n\\n[b]3.[/b]\\nThe uniqueness of exotic perks are truly where destiny shines. It can range from \"Melee kills restore health for a short duration.\" to \"Sliding reflects projectiles\". These exotics can drastically change your playstyle and makes the replay value a whole lot better.\\n\\n[h2]Cons[/h2]\\n[b]1.[/b]\\nYes this game is free. However, if you plan on playing any of the end game, or have any cool or unique armor or guns, you will have to spend money on DLCs. Playing this game without any DLCs is like eating french fries without salt, its possible... but are you okay?\\n\\n[b]2.[/b]\\nIf none of your friends play destiny 2, good luck with the end game content. You will be constantly reminded of how brain dead randoms can be. Also, playing destiny alone can be extremely boring. I personally NEVER boot the game if none of my friends are down to join. This may be very subjective but I can not play this game alone and not go insane.\\n\\n[b]3.[/b]\\nThe general destiny community is pretty decent. Don\\'t get me wrong, I have made some great friends through raids and dungeons, however the illusion of a friendly non-toxic community dissolves once you enter ranked PvP in any form. It is insane how many entitled bottom fraggers I have met. So many people join, don\\'t say a word the whole game, gets 27 damage, and rages once you lose. PvP can be great fun, just highly unlikely to achieve with randoms. Now there are exceptions to this as well, just extremely rare.\\n\\n[b]4.[/b]\\nDestiny does this fun little thing called \"Vaulting content\" which in long terms means removing content youve paid for. This is extremely infuriating. Removing the less actively played content players paid for, vaulting them, and \"maybe re-using them\" is not an acceptable excuse and a certain way to lose players. Entire planets disappearing, huge storylines gone, several guns and armor pieces no longer able to acquire. This is very unfortunate for new players as they will most likely never experience those missions and never get their hands on the items.\\n\\n[b]5.[/b]\\nThe matchmaking in this game is crazy. I can not tell you the amount of times me and my friend has queued for a match, and our teammate gets 0-25 damage per round, while every enemy has at least 3k hours in game and hits you the split second you peek. The matchmaking is truly a joke. You can not play this game seriously without having teammates before you queue.\\n\\n[h2] Bugs & issues[/h2]\\nAs for ghost melee and the revive feature not working sometimes, its rather self explanatory. Sometimes when you hit a melee, it doesn\\'t deal any damage and sometimes when you revive someone, they doesn\\'t actually get revived. This can lead to you loosing a very intense fight due to something that shouldn\\'t have happened, causing frustration, anger and maybe even sadness. \\n\\n[h2] Technical[/h2]\\nI use an i5 10400f with a 2070 super 8gb Vram and 32gb ram with a 280hz 1080p monitor, using a combination of mid to max settings and im sitting at around 180fps in pvp on average. It may drop down to around 140, but its never unstable or causes drastic fps drops. You will most likely not have any trouble with fps or performance if you have a decent PC.\\n\\n[h2]Verdict: Good, but not great[/h2]\\nAll in all, Destiny 2 offers fun and satisfying PvP, unique armor and guns as well as fantastic raids and dungeons. Destiny 2 can be very enjoyable, but the negatives are too big to ignore. I give this game a 7/10.\\n\\n[table]    [tr] [td] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42637369/] Follow my Curator Page if you want to see more of my reviews!

       "  'review': 'With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\\n\\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn\\'t always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\\n\\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\\n\\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \\n\\nWith that said, dungeons (currently \\'The Shattered Throne\\', \\'Pit of Heresy\\', \\'Prophecy\\' which is free to all players, \\'Grasp of Avarice\\', \\'Duality\\', and \\'Spire of the Watcher\\') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, \\'Vow of the Disciple\\' from Witch Queen, as well as \\'Vault of Glass\\' and \\'King\\'s Fall\\' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don\\'t shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. \\'Tis only polite). \\n\\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it\\'s fine I guess, but I\\'ve never liked PvP that\\'s dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\\n\\nSome stuff just won\\'t be explained in game. It\\'s not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\\n\\nFor anything that you can\\'t easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we\\'d be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \\n\\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\\n\\nEyes up, guardian.\\n\\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS\\'s, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I\\'ve missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I\\'ll do my best to update this periodically. \\n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\\n\\n-----------------\\nTL:DR: It\\'s good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it\\'s free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you\\'re overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\\n-----------------\\n\\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\\n\\n    \\nBeginner\\'s Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\\n\\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\\n\\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\\n\\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\\n\\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\\n\\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\\n\\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\\n\\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

       "  'review': \"2017: Bought Destiny 2 & Season Pass for like $100. Did pretty much everything there was to do in the base game, Curse of Osiris and Warmind. Was sorely disappointed about the lack of content and amount of things to do. I had a good time with it, but I ultimately wrote the game off as a loss and walked away. Laughed at the thought of a year 2 season pass after getting burned so hard the first time.\\n\\n2018: Pretty much forgot Destiny 2 existed.\\n\\n2019: Continued forgetting Destiny 2 existed until October 1st. Decided to give New Light a try because screw it why not. I'm completely overwhelmed with how much the game has grown and the sheer amount of things to do. The game did a full 180 from what it was last time I played it. Within a couple days of New Light I went ahead and bought Forsaken and Shadowkeep because I felt like Bungie finally earned my money. Looking forward to reaching the light cap again, min/maxing stats and going for perfect weapon rolls.\\n\\nI'm so glad Bungie chose Steam over Epic. If Destiny 2 had gone to Epic instead this review wouldn't exist and Bungie wouldn't have my money. So, well done there guys.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Is Destiny 2 a good game?\\nYes. It\\'s a solid FPS, with fun and mixed mechanics, fun abilities, and a good variety of weapons.\\nIt\\'s a game that I have spent over 2k hours on, was my first game to break 1k on, and is a game of which I have spent literal hundreds on, both for myself and friends.\\nIt is one of the only games I preorder content for.\\n\\nBut is it a game I recommend to new players?\\n\\nAnd this is what breaks my heart. Because I CANNOT recommend this game to new players. Not in it\\'s current state. Not unless things improve.\\n\\nSTORY:\\nThe story of Destiny is rich and indepth. We\\'re far beyond the point where it was hidden in lore cards. DLC has fully cast characters, often good narrative beats, and is generally a good time.\\nSeasons have gone from being a thing with loot and an activity, to near episodic stories told over weeks.\\nThe story in Destiny has never been better...\\n\\nAnd never been worse.\\n\\nDue to the DVC, new players are locked out of two whole years of story, and soon to be a third.\\nThey miss out on critical character arcs, and narrative context for current events.\\nWhat content remains is a mix of old and new, clashing content and contexts that leave new players confused as to who is who, and where they\\'ve gone.\\n\\nACTIVITIES:\\nThere are a number of core playlists that offer casual and hardcore experiences. There is endgame content for those who thirst for it. There are seasonal activities that offer a variety of fun side activities. There are bounties, challenges, and triumphs to chase.\\nBut there used to be so much more.\\nSome of the most fun, and most rewarding activities are gone, and whilst the newer activities are fun...\\nThey fail to live up to the past so far. And they too are soon to vanish.\\n\\nCOST:\\nThis is where Destiny fails the most.\\nYou can buy:\\n- DLCs\\n- Seasons\\n- Cosmetic MTX\\n- Transmog MTX\\nAll of this can add up to a high cost, especially for newer players coming in.\\nAll of the \"free\" content has been stripped away to the core playlists, of which you are occasionally locked out of for the week if you don\\'t have the DLC, (nightfalls).\\nFurthermore, instead of some parts of vaulted content becoming free, (subclasses, activities, weapons), Bungie is instead making this an EXTRA cost in the form of a mini DLC.\\n\\nAll of this results in a horrendous experience for new players, who starting out:\\n- Are facing a (Technically) pay to win economy, where subclasses and weapons are locked behind DLC paywalls in PVP content.\\n- Are left with no guidance of what they can, or cannot do.\\n- Are limited to only a handful of core activities, of which sometimes are unavailable.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this game to a new player, because the red tape of what is and isn\\'t available behind which paywall and how long it\\'ll exist before it\\'s gone, and what isn\\'t going...\\nIs all too much.\\n\\nPlease Bungie. Fix your sh*t.\\nOther games do transmog right. Other games let you keep your season passes once the season is over because you brought it.\\nOther games don\\'t strip away story and content from both the free and paid players.\\nThe DVC is a necessary evil, but with each \\'vaulting\\' the new players are left with less, and everyone is left with a bigger mess.\\n\\nI know you can make this right. Please do so.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit: Jan 18, 2023: Bungie\\'s actually came out and made it a lot easier for newer players with more changes coming with the newest expansion on February 28th. To start, all armour mods are unlocked for everyone now by default. You used to have to visit a specific person every day to hope she sells the mods you needed. So that\\'s better. Coming with Lightfall more systems in the game are getting streamlined for easier understanding and working. Most of my issues here still stand, but as others have pointed out: buying from a third party site can be cheaper. I would like to amend this completely though. \"Unless something changes, which I don\\'t see happening soon..\" I will admit, I was wrong. These changes are very promising and I am hopeful that more and better changes will come. I would recommend trying the game and if you like it, look into buying some of the expansions.\\n\\nI know, I have 1200+ hours on Steam, I have more on Xbox before I moved over. This isn\\'t a meme though. I love this game, truly I do, there is nothing else like it. I have met so many friends, created so many memories, and got into a relationship because of this game. It\\'s amazing, incredibly fun, and a joy to millions. The problem is this game is so Anti-New Player it\\'s disgraceful. \\n\\nThe price to join is absurdly high, the fact that previous expansions don\\'t get price dropped to like $5 after a year is an insult. If you want to play everything in the game right now, you need to buy 3 Major Expansions that cost between like $40-$80 USD each. Then another $40 for the Season passes to get the content that arrives throughout the year. Then when the next major expansion comes out, it\\'ll cost you another like $100 to play that content. \\n\\nSay you can swallow that pill though and pick up the game. The tutorial is really, really bad and barely teaches you anything. It\\'s tedious to do on other characters if you wanted to experiment with other classes. And then once the tutorial is done, it throws you out into the world and says \"Good Luck!\". It might throw you into a seasonal story mission, but those are usually story based and require A. Knowledge of what\\'s going on. B. Only give you the first mission if you didn\\'t by the season pass. C. Puts you like 3/4ths of the way through an ongoing story of the year and refuses to make you play through it in order. If you\\'re lucky, it will just leave you with no clue of what to do, where to go, what any of the terms mean, nothing.\\n\\nSpeaking of terms, there is a lot. MMO levels and it is overwhelming with not a great way to learn it in game. You talking activities? Well you got: Patrols, Strikes, Nightfalls, Dungeons, Raids, Story Missions, Seasonal Missions, Gambit, Crucible, Trials of Osiris, Dares of Eternity. Wanna talk weapons? Kinetic, Energy, Special, Primary, Heavy/Power, Solar, Arc, Stasis, Void, Archetypes, Supers, Class Abilities, like 20 different Grenades, dozens of weapon perks. It tells you so little about what any of these mean. If you\\'re new, likely these are all just gibberish or mumbo jumbo.  \\n\\nIf you make it through all of that, and you start playing, and you start doing activities and browsing Twitter or Reddit you\\'ll eventually hit the hardest sell of them all. A lot of content has been removed from this game. A lot. Most of it was unused, but it also leaves anyone who picks up the game completely unaware of most things going on. Characters will address you as an old friend and you will have just met them 3 minutes ago. Characters will talk that have been out of the game for years now. People will make references to missions or levels or worlds that were incredible, but you\\'ll never be able to experience them. One of my favourite missions in the game is running through a destroyed human made structure, platforming and racing against time before it engages in a tough, all out firefight where you either run out of time or win and claim an incredibly strong gun. It\\'s gone. It\\'s been gone for almost two years now. It and so much else was just fun and FOMO just killed any chance of you, the reader, ever trying it.\\n\\nDestiny 2 has always been easy for me to describe. \"It\\'s the best game I will never recommend to anyone.\" Unless you have a friend helping you through and teaching you things, you\\'ll be alone in an ocean not knowing what to do next. Unless something changes, which I don\\'t see happening soon, I would avoid diving into this. Destiny 2 is incredible. There are so many great things I could have talked about: Gunplay is best in genre, Environments are breathtaking, raids are such a bonding experience with friends. But if you\\'re new to the game the cons will heavily outweight the pros, especially when so many problems are front loaded.',\n",

I REALLY miss the spoopyness of Shadowkeep and even Beyond Light was fun, but I feel like the game has lost the magic from the original campaigns, warts and all. I know they were running out of space (and so were our HDDs), but I just feel jilted that I can't go back and replay it all again, to discover the Dreaming City all over, to take on the Fallen and avenge Cayde, to kick Ghaul's ass and stand over the ruined Red Legion in victory...even delve into the Infinite Forest and look for Osiris (still the shortest/smallest DLC). Yeah, it may be nostalgia goggles, seeing only the good while forgetting the bad, but I miss it so damn much. Now? I have no desire to return. All my favorite rifles and exotics are nerfed into oblivion. The pinnacles I ground my ass off for are little more than dusty relics, and I'm just so...damn...tired.

       "  'review': 'Ok, I am going to give a brief but concise review on this wonderful bipolar game. \\n\\nIn summary: Most Destiny 2 players joking but correctly describe this game as \" I hate Destiny 2, its my favorite game\". \\n\\nFor those unknowing of Destiny 2\\'s gameplay loop, it may seem strange. But if you ever jump in, you will quickly understand why.\\n\\nThis is.... is a game for masochists. \\n\\nThere is soooooooo much to do and never enough hours in a week to do it all in. You will play for hours grinding away your life trying to get items in this game. \\n\\nIf you are a completionist OCD gamer, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST PLAYING THIS GAME. This game will trigger you in all the worst ways. There are FOMO yearly events on top of the tri monthly seasonal content that will have you obsessively playing away your life trying to impossibly do everything as quickly as possible before the events/seasons expire. \\n\\nI am not even touching the predatory Eververse store, thats just pure FOMO glitter bait. And you cannot escape that in any triple A game anymore. Not even a listed con, just a fact. \\n\\nWhat IS predatory however is Bungie\\'s nebulous changes of the game every few months to a year. If you drop this game for a bit and come back several months to a year later, its a completely different game literally due to their new content vault system. \\n\\nThe part that makes it nebulous is that they are vaulting paid DLC content you have previously purchased and played. Which is a huge red flag for new forms of predatory DLC FOMO. Literal FOMO for DLC purchases on top of the usual season pass exclusivity content. \\n\\nOnce again, if you are an OCD completionist. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It\\'s not good for your mental health. \\nIt\\'s a damn fun game, but you can get pulled in, in the worst ways. \\n\\nIf you enjoy this game casually, you are a stout soul because this game is for you. It\\'s fun for a few mindless hours, but for endgame playing, its a mindless grind that will have your soul wither away from either missing FOMO events because of IRL commitments or just the sheer amount of it you need to do to get the items you want to drop. \\n\\nI walked away from this game for my mental health and because I had an epiphany of how dangerous this game\\'s true predatory nature is. As well as the very dangerous DLC transaction model Bungie is positioning into place with Witch Queen. I refunded my WQ Digital Edition Deluxe because I am that concerned about it. \\n\\nIn conclusion: Fun game, but dangerous for people who have issues with controlling their impulses and time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Ah, Destiny. I love so much about this franchise. The gameplay, shooting, jumping, throwing lots of grenades, dismantling guns.. Destiny is a franchise I\\'ve spent a lot of time in. I\\'ve accomplished some of the hardest achievements in the game. Low man raid encounters, solo flawless dungeon completions, Conquerer seals, etc. \\n\\nMy honest opinion on this game is that it\\'s the best PvE FPS experience out there, ruined in multiple ways by problems that honestly shouldn\\'t be hard to fix or at least shouldn\\'t have been a problem for this long. I\\'ll start with the good:\\n\\n- Top tier gunplay and class feel\\n- The in game movement is an underrated part of the experience in my opinion, each class has it\\'s own traversal tech if you really want to git gud\\n- The raids and dungeons oh my god, they\\'re so awesome. Almost worth the time to invest into alone\\n- Some of the coolest moments in the history of online gaming have happened in Destiny (just look up the Whisper mission)\\n- The seasonal stories over the past year and current campaign as of writing this (Witch Queen) have great storytelling\\n- Guns. So many guns. Almost a gun for every situation. Most of us in the community have actual real nostalgia for the muscle memory of some of our guns that we can\\'t use anymore. \\n- Tons of content to check out for a new player\\n- Regular weekly updates from the dev team on Thursdays (TWAB = This Week At Bungie)\\n- On top of that, the dev team is pretty active on Twitter when the more unhinged members of the player base aren\\'t sending them death threats\\n- The soundtrack is incredible\\n- This is gonna sound like a meme but for real, the enemy AI in this game is pretty incredible. It can bug out sometimes of course but especially in harder content, different enemy types approach you different ways based on the weapons you use or the places you stand.\\n- If you like the Diablo experience of just mowing down packs of enemies, D2 can fill that spot in your heart\\n\\nNow for the cons:\\n\\n- We\\'re all addicted. You\\'ll see this whole \"lol 5k hours I don\\'t recommend but I\\'ll log back in tomorrow\" jokes and honestly, there\\'s some truth to that. It\\'s a grindy MMO game. Some elements of it are designed to keep you playing.\\n- All the classics are here: weekly drip-feeding of new content, bad communication on certain long-standing issues in the game for months and even years at a time, and a general level of jank and bugginess to the game that doesn\\'t really ever go away.\\n- Certain parts of the game are massively undeveloped, but forced into the same grinds every season. Crucible, the main PVP mode in this game, only just got it\\'s first new map this season (4 weeks ago at the time of writing) in over 3 years.\\n- Gambit, another main playlist, has been reworked like 4 times(?) since it came out and has somehow gotten worse each time. Also hasn\\'t had a new map since it came out, and has in fact actually lost content since it\\'s release.\\n- The whole game runs on peer to peer servers. This isn\\'t super noticeable for the majority of content in the game, as most of the content in Destiny 2 is team based PvE content or story missions etc, but this makes the PvP just generally unplayable to a lot of people who try it. Crucible can be very fun but there\\'s always a layer of \"oh wow I just headshot that guy with my reticle at least half of my screen away from him\"\\n- The cosmetic shop in Destiny 2, the eververse, is not one of the worst systems I\\'ve ever seen but it\\'s not super great either. It\\'s a pretty classic case of all of the best looking armor sets in the game, and virtually ALL weapon ornaments (weapon cosmetics in regular terms) being locked behind either a real money purchase or PRAYING it goes on sale for a currency you can earn weekly in game. Some cosmetics in the eververse haven\\'t been available for bright dust in years.\\n- Sunsetting, a big process that happened about 2 years ago, removed a ton of content from the game that most of us paid real money for. Entire expansion areas, weapons, quests, etc. were \"vaulted\"\\n- Bungie has a history of taking a really long time to fix more wide, sweeping issues with the game\\n- Bungie\\'s current season system has a few good elements to it, but overall the way they\\'ve designed seasons has become pretty stale over the past 2 years or so\\n- Bugs, man. Destiny 2 is always a buggy game, more than most in my experience. Most of us learn to live with the general jank, but it can be really frustrating sometimes. This season (Season of the Haunted) has been even worse than usual.\\n- The main 3 playlists, Vanguard Ops (short PvE missions such as strikes and battlegrounds), Crucible, and Gambit, are roughly 40% or maybe more of your playtime each season, yet they haven\\'t updated them in any meaningful way in at least 3 years. \\n- The pricing of this game. Realistically, D2 should\\'ve never been pushed as a free to play game. If you wanna access, and I\\'m not exaggerating, 95% of this game, you have to buy the expansions anyway. There\\'s no \"previous expansions\" bundle at a reduced price, and nowadays there\\'s even stuff like the 30th anniversary pack that gives you a dungeon and a rocket launcher for 30 bucks. It\\'s hard to get new players into this game when you have to open with \"well I know it says free to play but if you wanna realistically do the endgame content in this game (Trials/GM Nightfalls) you\\'ll have to spend like 200 dollars for all the expansions\"\\n- The UI is kinda slow and bad. There\\'s a decent amount of item bloat so if you\\'re like me and hate having like 10 new flashing items in your inventory, you\\'re gonna spend a lot of time holding your F key to dismantle things\\n\\nDestiny 2 is a game that is super great at it\\'s core, but tends to shoot itself in the foot a lot of the time. It\\'s a conflicted game, with most of the dev time in seasonal content seemingly going towards releasing new things and rarely improving the content we spend the majority of our time grinding. It\\'s also a game that\\'s going through a big transition period right now. Currently Bungie has made it pretty clear that they\\'re developing D2 for the long term right now, so some things are just being pushed to the side for the overall health of the future of the game. I don\\'t know how much I believe that, but if you\\'re reading this and you know what I mean when I say Path of Exile 2, I salute you. \\n\\nOne thing I haven\\'t really mentioned so far is that realistically, the best content in this game really requires a group of friends to enjoy at it\\'s fullest. I\\'ve been lucky enough to make some real long-term friends in my clan, and legitimately spend a lot of my time teaching new players how to do raids/dungeons/GMs. If you\\'re a solo player, many activities are either straight up impossble (raids) or they require significant time investment to complete solo (dungeons, GM nightfalls, etc). It\\'s a game all about building your vault of items so you have something for every situation. New weapon roll for this build, crazy armor roll with great stats, etc. This can take a long time and kind of creates this weird situation for newer players where they can just go months without getting a certain exotic weapon they need. \\n\\nTo cut things short, I love this game and have obviously spent a lot of time with it. I can\\'t currently recommend it to newer players unfortunately. If you\\'re returning, maybe. The Witch Queen campaign on Legendary difficulty is some of the most fun I\\'ve had with my friends in this game in years, and the seasonal stories really do get better and better. If you have friends and the disposable income, give the game a shot. If you want the game to respect your time, look elsewhere.',\n",

       "  'review': \"So I've been playing this game for 1300+ Hours so far on bnet, now moving onto steam for a lot more.\\nGonna share my story about the great community, but if you're wondering if you should get the game, just go for it, it's absolutely worth your time.\\n\\nAnyways.\\n\\nThrough this game, I've had so many empty hours filled with entertainment, excitement, and sometimes frustration (that's mostly PvP. lookin at you One Eyed Mask)\\n\\nBut the thing I like most about this game, and what has left an impression on me, is the community. The dev team and the players make up the best gaming community I've been a part of.\\n\\nBungie is the most transparent, bold, and dedicated development team I've seen in a long time. They don't do everything perfectly, of course, but they own up to mistakes, they address player feedback and adjust the game accordingly. Just watch their Shadowkeep ViDocs, it's so down to earth, and their actions have proved it's not an act. They feel like distant friends more than developers, and you can tell they truly care about everyone involved in making/playing this game.\\n\\nNow as for me,\\n\\nI started as a solo player with nobody to try this new game out with (I Started in vanilla)\\nAfter I LFG'd and learned my first raid, I joined a clan and made some great friends who I had an absolute blast with. Then I realized raids were such a good time, I wanted to share that experience with people who might not have a group to do it with, so I became a raid sherpa/guide.\\n\\nAfter many runs, lots of Leviathan, mainly, I realized I had a knack for teaching these, and wanted to grow a community from it.\\n\\nNow, since starting my own clan and adding 40+ people, I have made so many new friends and had so many hours of fun with strangers coming together to play my favorite game ever.  I'm someone prone to feeling lonely, and seeing people I brought together have fun chatting and becoming friends makes me feel like I belong.\\n\\nThrough this extremely well-crafted game, I've been able to build a community of players where we all feel like part of a space magic family. If any of my clan members read this sappy post, thanks for being there. You're the best.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"While this is marked as recommended, this rating has some pretty deep explanation below. TL:DR at the bottom.\\n\\nThis is a review by a guy who has a total of almost 2,900 hours at the time of writing, cumulative from BattleNet and Steam eras. Would have definitely been a lot more if I wasn't stuck on console for several months and wasn't in school or work when (and after) Steam support was enabled.\\n\\nI love this game. The universe, the lore, in particular. I have the Chronicler title for a reason, and if I didn't love the game world, I wouldn't have spent even 1000 hours on it. Probably not even 500.\\n\\nThe gameplay and current meta as-is are rapidly degrading. Does it have fun areas? Sure. Is it good fun for new players? Probably. Is it good for players that have been playing the Destiny series since vanilla Destiny 1? Most current sources say no. So, I'll give my opinions below for someone just downloading, or someone purchasing the game's expansions.\\n\\nThe free base game lacks the activities of the current seasonal structure but still has public seasonal events (such as the current guardian games). Is it fun? For a bit. The free campaign is a bit grindy at certain parts and doesn't have the best loot drops, but I'd likely still have fun with it if I hadn't played it before.\\nThere are no REAL re-play-ability features in any of the campaigns, apart from strikes and crucible, but the former gets tiring quickly and the latter loses its spark from time to time. I don't remember if gambit is still free for everyone, but it's in the same murky water.\\n\\nThe paid expansions are interesting, kinda fun solo (for the most part) and definitely fun in a group. If you plan to get any, make sure you get Forsaken and/or Shadowkeep (the 'upgrade edition' is 50 bucks, cheaper than getting both individually). I enjoyed both, and they were fun for a while. Emphasis on a while. I'll get to that later.\\nKeep in mind that the other campaigns (red war, warmind, and curse of osiris) come first in the timeline.\\n\\nThe other main paid feature (currently) are the Seasons. Each season comes with a different suite of content that will (currently) be phased out at the end of the season to make room for new content. This INCLUDES all matchmaking activities and triumphs attached to that particular season, as well as the seasonal badges. \\nSundial is a perfect example of this. If you don't know what I'm talking about, google it. It comes from the most recent lapsed season.\\nThe current season is very, VERY bland and tedious. It revolves almost ENTIRELY around Bounty completions, small tasks that have no real impact on gameplay other than to mix up what you need to do with your arsenal to complete their contents. The grind takes an age if you don't have days straight to play, and ends up with very little satisfaction because of how little content there is.\\nThis is only a real issue if you've been playing the game fairly regularly. If you're new to the game and/or universe, this issue will be far less apparent, and may not even show up until the next season due to the plethora of content available for a fresh character to complete. Unfortunately, however, this content drought cycle has become a VERY strong pattern. Luckily one that does not make me pay much for it, but one that still hurts all the same.\\n\\nSeasons are purchasable via a 'season pass' or individually. I'm not sure if costs are the same either way, the option disappears after purchase of the current pass.\\nContents include the seasonal content alongside something similar to the season passes in Fortnight, Division 2, COD, etc. without being the useless cash grabs that those ones are. I actually like the system of the reward track accompanying new content rather than it being separate from that release's dlc. \\nAre there items that encourage play? Yes. Is there a way to buy levels in the pass? Yes, but the items within the pass do not a strong character make, and purchasing levels is FULLY LOCKED until the season is almost over, rendering the possibility of pay-to-win being almost impossible. \\nGranted, f2p content does not have a large pool of excellent weaponry, but that's been a fact since before the game went free-to play, and I don't think the difference in loot pools is nearly as significant as some people would claim. Especially with the new armor system.\\n\\nThere's also loot boxes, but you can earn (most of) the items in the Eververse through gameplay and bright dust bounties. Does this mean I'm advocating the required completion of bounties for most cosmetics? Hell no. I'm borderline pissed that there STILL aren't any cosmetics attainable through normal gameplay and activity completion apart from the prestige Leviathan ornaments.\\n\\nNow, would I recommend this game? This is very complicated, as you can probably tell from the above.\\n\\nFor a new player with low dedication / time allocation to the universe of the game? Yes!\\nThere's a plethora of content to enjoy out of the box, and the fact that it's only 60 bucks for '3 years' of content is quite the steal.\\n\\nTo a new or returning player familiar with the lore, universe and with a lot of time on their hands to complete everything the game throws at us? Probably not. It really depends:\\n- If you haven't played D2 yet, you might get a good couple hundred hours of play time out of the box between grinding out the campaigns and hitting endgame 'earlier than intended'. For those of you, the 60 bucks might be worth it.\\n- For people who played vanilla and/or forsaken and/or shadowkeep? I assume you know most of the problems I mentioned above, and know to wait and see what they plan to change with their content-cycling system before you come back. I definitely wouldn't recommend a return at this point unless you want to get some friends into the game, or want to grind out the seasonal activities to see where the story is leading.\\n\\nTL:DR; I recommend this game with a few heavy warnings:\\n\\n1- If you plan on playing this game for an extended period of time, expect heavy content drought between season releases.\\n2- If you are returning to the game, I would suggest waiting or doing research on how Bungie is changing content-cycle systems.\\n3- If you've purchased or completed shadowkeep and/or forsaken and plan on getting the seasons, do NOT EXPECT THE SEASONS TO REFLECT THIS AMOUNT OF CONTENT. Seasonal content is often particularly gimmicky. Particularly, overuse of bounty mechanics is a huge let down.\",\n",

A lot of the story is hidden behind season (passes) so you also miss extra information that is quite relevant to the story, so next update comes and you're left wondering what the heck is going on. You can't just proceed through the timeline as it is and instead get spoilers about the story in every possible way. \\n\\nHow about an option to force the game to follow the main storyline in order?\\n\\nThey release new content and then they make old content useless.

They don't want you to progress too fast.\\n\\nNever buy the DLC for full price. It's just not worth it. This has been an issue since Destiny 1. They originally cut off a lot of main story content and sold it off in DLC's. Actually, long before the DLC's were made available people were able to glitch into the DLC areas that were fully available in the base game, but were activated when you bought DLC. They then released Taken King and forced you to buy the whole game + DLC's again for full game price rather than allowing old players to buy just the DLC for cheaper. They then released the game currency and now you can spend at least 20€ to buy single armor skins or even more to unlock seasonal content during the year.\\n\\nTo fully enjoy the game you'll have to be prepared to spend hundreds on this game each year.\\nActivision was bad, but it feels like Bungie wants to be worse with their monetization.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I HAVE SPENT(or wasted): 1000 HRS OF MY LIFE ON THIS GAME (Which is nothing compared to some of you, but I like the number 1000)\\n\\nAnd therefore, I now feel like an entitled idiot who will now give you a review. Because after spending 1000 hrs of my oxygen and brain-cell power on this game, I feel like I know just little bit about it. A little bit. So without any more stupid rambling, here's my poorly constructed, naive, and somewhat botched review of Destiny 2...*clears throat*\\n\\nI joined the ranks of the Vanguard when D2 was on the ol' Battlenet, back when Activision still had its mits on Bugie's precious player base. And since its migration to the new platform here at Steam, there have indeed been some changes in latency, player-base, and server issues. Which to be honest, I think we all expected right from the word go.\\n\\nIf you are starting D2 as a new light with no background knowledge, it is important to remember that progressing through every task given to you is going to get you that light-level advantage when leveling up your guarding for the first time. This is where the first hiccup comes in.. Since we had the big Shadowkeep update, trying to figure out where to go next in your quests can be a small nightmare. \\nI spent an entire night with one of my clan's blueberries trying to help her figure out where to go before we succumbed to Googling the directions like tourists in a foreign city. If Bungie could potentially alter the quest tracking to perhaps make the major quests more linear in their pursuit, it'd be a whole lot easier for people coming in with no prior knowledge to the games mechanics.\\nThat said, If you need to go in blind, always check your destinations tab and hover over each planet where the flashing symbol is relevant to your quest. Each major DLC will have a symbol that you can follow through the Solar System.\\nTo get to the major stories: Amanda Holiday herself is where you will find the major story line journeys as you begin your career as a magnificent Space Moron.\\n\\nDestiny 2 I think appeals to people who have a good eye for lore and rich environments. The first thing that overwhelmed me was how detailed some of the biomes were. Especially the Dreaming City, which I think we can all agree is one heck of a place! It's pretty important to take note of those small details that Bungie has put in, down to reading the lore books that are there too. One aspect however that the current player base rolls their eyes at is the bounty system: Bounties are the backbone of the seasonal progress. And while I get that Bungo has tried to centre its play style around bounty completions, which can get repetitive, you do have to engage with this mechanic to build your light level.\\n\\nWhat D2 additionally excels at is creating a place where you can progress at your own speed, or have your fireteam/clan help you through certain areas that you need help with. The Clan system offered by D2 is a standout in that it allows you to connect your skills with that of others to accomplish tasks that are integral to the game. There is some content that does very much need a fireteam to be completed. But if you're a magical rootin' tootin' alien shootin' god of computers games, then running solo can always give you big results too. \\nThe main consensus is however that joining a clan is is your best interest. And that is because the gain you can receive in loot and bounty-clocking is a lot better when you have other Space Morons with you terrorising the universe.\\n\\n  Which brings me to the PVP element. *Deep sigh*\\n\\nAs a PVE enthusiast, I thought I'd never really delve into the PVP elements solely because my level of skill is appalling. I know Shaxx is very encouraging everytime I go to see him, but I'm 99.9% sure he's just being nice to poor little Miss D, who repeatedly falls of the map while she is scoped in.\\nWith how many people do have accounts solely for the purpose of playing Crucible Competitive and Trials of Osiris, you are going to find some of your matches are going to be simply dying repeatedly to laggy space-apes who are not going to change from using their shotguns. The toxicity level of these groups (which can sometimes be entire clans of elitist PVP lunatics) you really have to ignore if you want to try and push your way through the ranks. \\nHowever if you have a supportive clan (like mine) you'll find after a few rounds and finding your optimal loadout, you will enjoy it! \\nFollowing the meta on weapon types can help you get your feet in a match, but be aware you will not be liked for it! \\n\\nFinally we have the guardian classes themselves. \\nI feel this is absolutely worth talking about, and when you look at the pop culture around each class, you can't help but be entertained by it all. \\nWhat you play effects very much your play style: Hunters are often high speed, high damage dealing plucky little acrobats with big mouths. Warlocks are the bookworms with a ego who think they are the only reason the team didn't wipe on the boss. And Titans... well. We just like Titans because they are easy to pick and often have Crayola dust left on their helmets after too many snacks.\\nJokes aside, a well constructed fireteam/raid team/6 stack will have at least one of each class. This generally distributes the skill pattern quite well, and some of the most stress-free raids I've ever run have had a good balance of all 3.\\nAgain. However:\\nIf you want to run yourself through most of this game for the challenge, Titans do possess the skill trees that can more effectively push you through the more difficult situations you may find yourself in. Yes, we pick on them relentlessly, but they do play a big role in Destiny, and will continue to be fantastic Space Apes into the future of D2.\\n\\nWell. I've finished dinner and written 6 or so paragraphs, so I suppose this is where you end a review? I have no idea. As mentioned afore, I have the writing competency of a scientific calculator if you had taped fake nails on it and asked it to do a bachelor of journalism. \\nAll-in-all, I have immensely enjoyed this game, and will continue to. Yes this game has some serious bugs, but it is still lovable in its own buggy way. Have a go. Watch some guides. Get a good clan (come join ours it's the best). Go give the Darkness the stiff upper lip and have a gaff with Zavala. \\n10/10 for Creativity and Originality.\\n7/10 for Space Magic. \\n1/10 for Chonky Crayons.\\n8/10 for Gameplay.\\n11/10 for Good TImes!\\n\\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk. No refunds on brain cells lost from reading all of this garbage. \\nSalut!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b] TLDR: Silence Bungo, I do not wish to grind for rolls anymore, I wish to be happy... [/b]\\n\\n[h1] The New player experience [/h1]\\nIt\\'s 2022. You decide to check out this hot and cool shooter called Destiny 2. You log in, make a character, and watch the intro. It\\'s short, mysterious and the music swells as the title is revealed and you\\'re instantly immersed in the world. You then proceed to shoot and disintegrate some aliens throughout the intro missions and perhaps think to yourself: \"Wow! I get to wield space magic and use a multitude of guns, this gameplay is awesome. I can\\'t wait to play the rest of the game!\". As you put in some hours though, eventually, inevitably, it hits you: \"Wait, what am I supposed to do again? Whats the story? Who are these people? Is there a campaign I can play? Hold on what do you mean that intro was actually from Destiny 1? Where can I talk to other players? Should I buy an expansion? Which one should I get? Do I need a season pass? [strike] What the fuck is a zorpalod [/strike] .\" In short, its a bit of a mess for newcomers. For all its focus on an ongoing story and \\'living world\\' through yearly expansions and seasonal content, the very nature of seasonal story telling (which are usually ~ 10 weeks) means you\\'ll miss out on them if you were not playing then. Coupled with the content vault, where Bungie shelved/removed/deleted/dragged-out-behind-the-shed-and-shot roughly half the game around Beyond Light (2020) and will most likely continue to do so for older expansions (for the sake of game stability), means that it is difficult for new players to orient themselves in the game\\'s world if they don\\'t even have the opportunity revisit older content.\\n\\n[h1] The Shootin\\' [/h1]\\nAdmittedly, the game plays fantastically. No other game I\\'ve tried nails the feeling of popping some space demon\\'s head with an over-sized handgun and incinerating his pals with lightning like Destiny, and to add the ability of experiencing it with friends no less. Moment to moment gameplay is awesome, and encounter design for more higher level content is usually pretty well thought out, and its the reason why most people stick with the game even if they might complain about it in the same sentence. Most importantly, Bungie knows this. They know they have lighting in a bottle, and over the years it has been proven that however much the very vocal Destiny community likes complain of things, they will still continue to put in hundreds upon hundreds of hours. If you understand that, then you\\'ll understand why the game is monetized and priced the way it is. \\n\\n[h1] The Price [/h1]\\nDon\\'t be fooled, its really a \"free to try\" sort of situation. With season passes lasting around 3 months and the big dramatic expansions coming yearly, you\\'re expected to pay somewhere upwards of £80 pounds a year if you intend to keep playing and having things to do. Video games are an extremely cost-efficient medium and there are so many interesting games out there to buy for a fraction of the cost, giving you more value and enjoyment for the money you spend. Though what\\'s provided by the seasons and expansions is often well made and interesting, it is hard for me justify their full price tag under any circumstances. Coupled with this is also the enormous amount of microtransactions present in the game, from skins to emote to ships and anything of the like. Look I get it, its a long lost battle against microtransactions in video games, but if an in-game emote costs roughly as much as an season pass and the rewards and activities (repetitive as they may be) associated with it, I can\\'t help but feel a little ripped-off. At least a couple years ago one could say hey, at least a couple campaigns are free and playable, but those are long gone. Essentially, it feels like a subscription service and you should know what you\\'re getting into. \\n\\n[h1] The Loop [/h1]\\nAs is par for the course of the genre, the game eventually devolves into several repetitive gameplay loops in certain activities if you\\'re trying to achieve some specific goal/item. There is a lot of things to do in the game don\\'t get me wrong, but inevitably one may find themselves grinding for some particular goal, be it a good roll on a gun or whatever and just spend hours on it. In this case, Bungie is very good at making \\'boxes\\' for the player to tick, and playing Destiny 2 sometimes makes me feel like I\\'m some hamster in a wheel thinking he\\'s progressing somewhere, while simultaneously being afraid of missing out on timed content. It is what it is, and I suppose there is nothing wrong in finding enjoyment in that, but it is important to hold no illusions over what ~80% of the game actually is. \\n\\n[h1] The Closing Thoughts[/h1]\\nAbout the main reason I would recommend Destiny 2 to completely fresh players is the no cost of entry and its amazing gameplay. Try it out, the look and feel of the game is brilliant, and as long you are aware of what you are getting yourself into, you might even like it. But the price and nature of drip-fed content along with peculiarities too numerous to fit in this review such as the reliance on third-party apps/websites for basic functionalities like loadouts or LFG\\'s leaves a lot to be desired. It does not help the fact that money spent on the game\\'s expansions just feels wrong considering the inevitable removal of said expansions down the road. As I\\'ve mentioned before, most continue to play because they\\'re just not much that compares to the way Destiny handles. \\nIf you are a returning player however, I would definitely recommend checking the game out again. It\\'s in a fairly alright state at the moment, while some controversial mechanics like sunsetting are gone (though what has been sunset will remain that way), and you are probably used to some of Bungo\\'s hijinks by now.',\n",

       "  'review': \"TL:DR - Satisfying guns, good campaigns and TONS of content make for a very good FPS-RPG game!\\n\\nDestiny 2 has some of the best FPS gunplay on the market today, especially if you enjoy playing with friends. If that's all you care about then you might want to give the game a try. D2 has just recently begun transitioning to a more RPG-focused style of play so some things such as mods, perks and skill trees aren't fully fleshed out yet. That said you probably won't notice this unless you're in the end-game trying to min-max your build.\\n\\nThe early game can be a little challenging for new players because of all the various systems at play. Think of it as an easier Warframe or Path of Exile. There are plenty of resources to find out more about the game however, particularly on Reddit. /r/ShardItKeepIt for deciding which weapons to keep or discard. /r/CruciblePlaybook for PvP tips. /r/DestinyTheGame as the official unofficial subreddit for the game, and /r/Destiny2 for the memes. You can also look to /r/Fireteams or the Destiny mobile app to find people to play with.\\n\\nIn terms of free content, the first three campaigns are unlocked - [i] The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind. [/i] You also have access to all strikes (replayable mini-missions), PvP and PvEvP maps and modes, and all 9 planets/destinations. Additionally there are three raids available - [i] Leviathan, Spire of Stars, and Eater of Worlds. [/i] These are challenging but fun 6-man activities that require a lot of coordination and skill to beat. There's a lot more F2P activities as well that you will find once you start playing. They may not have all been amazing at launch, but after 1-2 years of updates and tuning they've never been more enjoyable.\\n\\n[i] Forsaken [/i] is the first paid DLC. Purchase of it comes with the raids [i] Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow, [/i] as well as several exotic weapons. Even if you don't or won't raid, it's worth it for the story alone. It's a sci-fi western tale of revenge for a dear friend, and is Destiny's highest narrative moment. \\n\\n[i] Shadowkeep [/i] is the second and newest paid DLC. While not as impressive as [i] Forsaken [/i] story-wise, there's still a lot of content to do especially considering how it's bundled with the current Season Pass. This is the story of how another ancient threat is discovered under the Moon. Sounds underwhelming yes, but saying anymore would require spoilers. The current Season focuses on an army of machines controlled by sentient milk that invades the solar system. Absolutely worth it. There's also a raid included here, [i] Garden of Salvation, [/i] as well as an upcoming dungeon.\\n\\nAll in all, there's an overwhelming amount of content here if you're a new player. It may be daunting, but play through the (optional but highly recommended) campaigns and you'll soon find yourself at home with the game. \\n\\n\\nEdit - Just adding that I've put 800+ hours into the game before it transferred to Steam. One of my favorite games of all time.\",\n",

This is definitely a game where you should look up a quick beginner's guide as a newbie to point you in the right directions.\\n- No ingame guildfinder, you have to do that on bungie's website for some reason\\n- Hard to keep track of quests; you should be able to pin more than 4 quests at a time, the menu is disorganized and quests can get lost, and a lot of quests will leave you scratching your head until you just have to google how to complete it\\n- A few instances of missions bugging out forcing you to restart \\n- Waypoints could be better and less finicky \\n- Menus are not good in general\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nIf you like the idea of exploring, particularly in a space and science fiction setting, you might really enjoy this game. If you like shooting a bunch of things and chasing after loot, you will like this game. It can/does become a massive time sink however, which might be a good or bad thing depending on the player. \\nIf you are even considering playing this game, you should just give it a try because its free to play and you have nothing to lose.

       "  'review': 'Edit: I have seen the developer update about the state of Destiny from Joe Blackburn. When the changes and future plans leading up to the next DLC take effect, I will be updating this review.\\n\\nEdit 2: Last played on June 26, 2021. I have since uninstalled the game with no plans of returning anytime soon. Anyone who gets triggered by my review, it\\'s at your own expense. Happy reading.\\n\\nTL;DR: largely NOT free-to-play, core content removal, planned obsolescence, lack of play-testing and playerbase neglect, has left a large amount of current players feeling disrespected and disinterested.\\n\\nAs much as I love playing this game, to eager, new players thinking about getting into it: DON\\'T. With the developer\\'s design decisions removing a large amount of the game\\'s content, putting it into a \"content vault\" for use in the future, in the game\\'s current state, that \"free to play\" button on the store page is a lie. A majority of the game is currently locked behind a paywall, with many core activities only accessible if players buy the DLCs. There is no reduction in price for the DLCs from Bungie\\'s side for this lack of content, so, buyers beware. You will be paying full price for DLCs that had about 80% of its content left unplayable or removed.\\n\\nLast year, Bungie implemented \"sunsetting\" gear, a.k.a. the concept of planned obsolescence in the game. It is already in effect. 2 out of the 3 latest DLCs have [expired] gear that is unusable in the current season. This gear will be updated to have a new expiration date next season, however, the [expired] gear that players collect now, will not have their expiration date(s) updated. Players who invested time into obtaining gear that they want from the activities in the 2 earlier DLCs, have to grind for it all over again. No reduction of material costs to upgrade gear have been taken into account for the introduction of sunsetting, removing any incentive to continue the grind. Destiny 2 content creators on YouTube have also eaten their words. After initially supporting the idea of sunsetting to reduce powercreep, a majority of them now agree that it is bad for the game.\\n\\nWith the new DLC, Beyond Light, the developers introduced a new playable subclass, Stasis. Basically magic space ice wizardry. In the game\\'s PvP modes, these new subclasses are absolutely over-tuned. From a FPS player\\'s perspective, Stasis has disrupted the core of FPS gameplay, by literally allowing players to be frozen where they stand, allowing for easy frags. Slowing, as a game mechanic, also causes players to not have their shots registered to hit their target, even when they have their sights directly on them. It was obvious that they released the new subclasses without play-testing, to trap new players into buying Beyond Light. Also, they removed several PvP maps, with no new modes, entirely neglecting their PvP playerbase. How about that, a regression of content, in a live-service game.\\n\\nI will continue to see this game through. But if the above sounds like good decisions made by developers who respect your time invested into their game and know what you want as a player, and not a game in its death throes, I envy your blissful ignorance.',\n",

The weapons and armor you gather and invest resources into all are being given expiry dates of nearly a year, however a good portion of the game is marching straight into obsolescence and will no longer find use in endgame activities such as future raids, dungeons, and the Trials of Osiris. \\n\\nTake of that what you will, things will surely be turbulent in the coming years, with another expansion pack coming in September.\\n\\nWatch the game carefully, but more importantly make sure to have fun!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll give you a little background on me as a FPS player before getting into this review. If you look at my most-played games, Borderlands 2 & 2.5 top the list, followed by MachineGames\\' first Wolfenstein games, then the Deus Ex reboot and Half-Life 2 sitting pretty at 200+ hours. DOOM 2016 is way up there as well as the original Rage. Honorable mention for Starbreeze/Vin Diesel\\'s \"Riddick\" games. Good stuff! Anyway, you get the idea. I like shiny shooty looty (mostly) story-driven single-player sci-fi games a whole lot.\\n\\nI am not a fan of multiplayer games, though. The last multiplayer arena shooter I played and actually enjoyed was one of the really old Unreal Tournaments. Let\\'s just say I was a bit wary about getting into this. I was peripherally aware of the drama surrounding the original Destiny, and I\\'ve never played a Bungie game before, so I was all set to ignore this until a friend peer-pressured me into checking it out. :P (And I owe him a beer or two for doing so!)\\n\\nSo if you\\'re like me, going into Destiny 2 blind, here\\'s the skinny: You are a post-human gun-toting space wizard and the Sol system is under attack by unpleasant dudes from another galaxy. Or maybe this galaxy. Doesn\\'t matter. There\\'s a lot of them and they\\'re ugly and you need to kill them or they\\'ll eat you and/or sign you up for outrageous student loans or something. The motives are always pretty clear for D2\\'s interplanetary Rambo pub crawl. In other words: yes, Private Hudson, it [i]is[/i] another bug hunt.\\n\\nLeveling in D2 is borrowed from, among others, Vermintide 2\\'s equipment-level system (i.e. your character gains levels by how powerful your gear is), and the equipment is doled out in drops from your kills and quest rewards, very much like Borderlands\\' loot-and-shoot mechanic. Lots of comparing rifles, helmets, boots, cheese, rocket launchers, cats, pianos, laundry hampers, etc.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got the skills to pay the bills, though, by which I mean D2\\'s class and skill system makes me unreasonably happy. You have 3 character slots, 3 races, and 3 main classes. Each of the 3 main classes have 3 elemental subclasses that you can switch to at any time, and each subclass can tweak their individual skills nearly on the fly. In one of my favorite MMOs from way back when, you could slot in certain skills from any of the classes in the game, on top of your main class/job, and the amount of gameplay customization this provides is significant. You get to tweak the skills of your chosen subclass even further with either the Forsaken or Shadowkeep expansion. (The consensus seems to be that Forsaken is the better value, FYI.)\\n\\nCharacter customization (face, hair, etc) is a bit bare, but it\\'s not a big deal as there is a massive amount of gear customization. Dye your sword (yes, there are 3rd-person swords) pink, paint your helmet black or green or whatever the hell you want with semi-rare drops called \"shaders\"; more infrequent drops include specific skins for specific gear, which you can also dye some insane color. Once you acquire a certain shader or skin, and you use it up on a trash piece of gear... you don\\'t have to hope for another random drop of the vanity item. Your pickups are all stored in a \"collections\" tab, where you can just grab them again for varying amounts of in-game (not cashy money) currency. Score!\\n\\nIt\\'s a system that reminds me of Assassin\\'s Creed: Odyssey\\'s persistent weapon/armor skins (whatever gear you picked up, its skin was saved to your character so you could always switch them in and out as per your fancy). Small thing, but showing consideration to the player and their time is sadly not something you always find in AAA games.\\n\\nD2 is huge. It takes place across the solar system that we all know and love, no matter how many planets you think are worthy enough of being called planets. This seems like a minor point, but getting to bounce around a bunch of worlds that you probably know the names of by heart, and seeing such stunning representations of the beauty of our sister planets... it all creates a deeply satisfying and familiar hook so you\\'re not bored to tears by your 50th visit to planet Flibbertygibbet. And it also helps that Bungie hires writers and scriptwriters who clearly know what the hell they\\'re doing, because for once, for ONCE, I\\'m not always skipping cutscenes or dialogue -- most of the quests feature a lot of good voicework and the script is quite funny a lot of the time.\\n\\nThat may or may not be due to the fact that there are [url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6721356/fullcredits]a lot of famous people providing voiceovers[/url] in D2. Your mileage may vary, of course, but this is a game with massive production values and it shows.\\n\\nWhat else... gunplay is freaking fantastic. I haven\\'t enjoyed visceral shooting like this since Wolfenstein or DOOM 2016. That\\'s the other thing that I\\'m constantly surprised by, that this is a really great shooter all by itself. In the open-world maps your player transitions seamlessly from open-world to instanced sections of the maps, meaning that once you enter a named cave or a ruin or whatever, no one else can come in with you other than your party, so if you really hate playing in a massively online blah-blah, you have plenty of options. Aside from raids and the like, it\\'s a very solo-friendly game as far as I can tell. D2 may borrow from the loot-and-shoot school of gaming but they took the time to build an astounding selection of guns, many of which feel and sound unique enough at lower tiers to give you a lot of versatility when you\\'re still starting out.\\n\\nAnd to top it off, the game community is really quite pleasant! Your mileage may vary, again, but there\\'s some obvious love for this game in the playerbase which comes out often in random interactions.\\n\\nIn summary: if you\\'re looking for a new addiction, and you like a little gun with your space opera, get stuck in. You may regret it if you have one of those \"social lives\" that people keep whispering about! Worth a try if you don\\'t. :P',\n",

       "  'review': 'You start playing destiny 2 . Eventually you will come across a weapon/armor piece that you really want to use in your builds. You start your grind for that gear . After hours & hours of grinding , it still doesn\\'t drop. At this point you become furious , even over the smallest of things . You start hating everything about the game & start criticising developers for every decision they have made. You think of how bad & unbalanced pvp is & especially with stasis , how the endgame is literally a grindfest , how the drop rates for many weapons is so low, how you get error coded for no resason , how the implementation of so many things (like recent transmog system in S14) is bad & how every step the dev\\'s take in the game makes it more worse , you start noticing how dev\\'s are paywalling most of the things . At this point you feel like every hour you invested in this game was a waste and that the dev\\'s dont respect your time at all . But remember while you are thinking of all these things , you are still grinding for that gear , you are still doing that activity . You dont want to stop grinding , At that point you say to yourself , I will invest another few hours and get that gear than stop now & waste all the hours that I invested today.  \\n  \\n You invest another couple of hours in grinding & at the end of the day ( or tomorrow, cause u wont stop, lol ) , you finally get that gear . Now you feel satisfied . You open your character menu and check that weapon . You are completely stunned/surprised . The weapon that you just got has absolute god tier perks in every column ( we call them god rolls in destiny ) . Its the weapon roll that your friends were chasing and still haven\\'t got . There\\'s a guy out there who invested 100+ hours in trials , has 50 flawless & still doesn\\'t have god roll igneous but you get it first try on ten losses by jumping off the map. Now you are completely happy & immensely satisfied. You never felt this kind of happiness even when you graduated . You know that if u show it to your friends , they r really gonna get jealous & that\\'s why you really want to show them . You get a raid exotic first try & your fireteam leader kicks you because of that , cause he still hasnt gotten it in 150 clears . But him kicking you in this case actually makes you more happy cause you know he is jealous of you. \\n\\n Now that you have got the god roll , the next phase starts . You think of all the positive things about the game , how it has so many activites that you can play endlessly with your friends and never get bored , how the game\\'s replayability factor is good , even though the endgame is grindfest , you still feel like doing it & never get bored of it, how the dev\\'s always keep saying \" we are listening \" & keep fixing stuff/try their best. How you can exploit bugs/cheeses in this game without getting banned cause bungie themselves said its their fault if such bugs exist, how the community (inspite of being toxic many times) comes together to donate & help whenever a charity is conducted . Now that you are happy you start playing the game with a positive vibe until you set your eyes on another weapon . \\n\\n The whole game is just you shifting your thoughts from positive to negative & vice versa from time to time , contradicting yourself & your own thoughts , but you will still keep playing & playing  & playing . You will eventually reach a point where you will have evrytg , & you dont feel like you need any new things anymore, but you will still keep playing. You wont know why you are playing the game anymore but you will still keep playing. You will get up at 3 AM in the midnight half asleep or sleep walking , load up destiny 2 , go to all vendors , collect their bounties and start doing them , all with your eyes closed . How you ask ? cause at  that point you would have already done each of those bounties a thousand times , so you would know subconsciously which bounty it will be from each vendor & even its objectives. \\n\\n I read this in one of the other reviews - \" If you are playing this game only for pvp , then you are being delusional \" , that perfectly sums up the pvp experience . You will feel like pvp is balanced & unbalanced at the same time . Unbalanced? stasis of course . You might have the best aim in the world , sm hunter with with a shuriken will freeze you & knock you out or a titan with his melee will throw you off the map or a warlock with his infinite super glitch will keep killing you until the round/game ends . Bungie did fix the warlock glitch , how? by disabling it of course. Balanced ? again stasis . You will run against a lot of hackers on pc , and stasis is again the countermeasure . The cheater might have infinite health , the titan will throw him off the map with his melee, He might have perfect aim , well he cant shoot if he is frozen , can he?. Pretty ironic that I talked about actual legit players while referencing unbalance & cheaters/hackers while referencing balance . That\\'s the power of stasis.\\n\\n  So to sum it all up , do I recommend this game ?\\n - Well YES , but actually NO.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Despite the troubled past of the series (for which both Bungie and Activision share the blame), the new free-to-play version of Destiny 2 on Steam (also known as Destiny 2: New Light) is one of the best online games you can play in 2019. \\n\\nOther than Forsaken and Shadowkeep, all of the previous expansion content along with all of the maingame content is now completely free. This amounts to a massive volume of places to explore, quests/adventures to do, routine patrols or public events as well as PvE missions/raids and a huge smattering of PvP content too. \\n\\nAnd in general, Destiny 2's world and story, as well as the visual design, graphics and soundtrack are among the best I've ever seen in a game. As far as gameplay goes, the game offers some of the best gunplay, moment-to-moment game loop and mechanics I've ever encountered in a game. \\n\\nDestiny 2 is a must-play and one of the best games to come out of Bungie ever since Halo 2.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]PREFACE:[/h1]\\n\\nI will start this by saying that you might find yourself looking at my \"hours played\" tag and either groan or stare confused. Yes, undoubtedly I play D2 quite a lot. I was going for an inside joke regarding Bungie, the parent company, as they LOVE the number 7; it\\'s one of their [i]leitmotif[/i], you could say. So I wanted to post this review when I hit the 7777h mark.\\n\\nThe latest edit just made the joke null. Oh well...\\n\\n[h1]THE REVIEW:[/h1]\\n\\nOk, now to the review. So I played this game even before it was brought to Steam, back in the days it was on Blizzard\\'s Battle Launcher. I like to think that I\\'m a veteran in terms of the information I have on the game, both lore-wise and mechanics-wise. (Even if I\\'m still sh*t at PvP, but that\\'s between us...). So I will pass onto you some of the main things to know about the game before starting it. And I hope you will enjoy it!\\n\\n[h1]THE GAME ITSELF:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]Plot:[/u]\\n\\nYou died. We don\\'t know how long ago. We don\\'t know in what manner you died. We don\\'t know what your name was, what you did during your life, who your relatives were. But we know that you are dead.\\n\\nYou are then resurrected one day by a small sentient drone-like A.I. entity called a Ghost. There are many Ghosts roaming the lands in search for their Guardian, as it is called. You are one of those. You are a Guardian of Humanity. You can wield various Light powers granted through this Ghost by a mysterious \"moon\", called the Traveler. This moon is floating above Earth, above the Last City. The last place where Humanity still stands.\\n\\nThousands of years in the past, a cataclysm called the Collapse happened in our Solar System, where the human race was driven all the way to the Last City on Earth by the forces of Darkness. Before that time, humanity was an interplanetary species. Colonizing most planets and moons from our System and already sending colony ships in the outer space.\\n\\nYour main goal now is to defeat the enemies in our planetary backyard.\\n\\n[h1]CHARACTER CREATION:[/h1]\\n\\n[u][b]/!\\\\ Warning! /!\\\\[/b][/u] You have to know this before actually creating your character. Its appearance can\\'t be changed after it has been created. You\\'d have to delete that char. completely and that\\'s not something you\\'d probably want to do if you had sunk enough time into that char. over time. (You can always keep your mask on in social spaces if you don\\'t want your face to be seen.)\\n\\nI will provide here the main options you have when choosing your appearance, so that you can make an informed decision on what you\\'re looking for.\\n\\nFirst of all, you can make 3 characters on your account. They can be either one of each class (Titan, Warlock, Hunter) or any combination of those: 2 of a type and 1 of another; or 3 of the same if you want to. But it\\'s not really worth going for anything other than 1 of each.\\n\\nSo you have 3 classes, 3 races and 2 sexes = 18 permutations.\\n\\n[u]The Classes:[/u]\\n\\n          - [b]TITAN[/b]: the \"paladin\" or \"barbarian\" of the game, in D&D terms. Titans are known for their barricades, that absorb incoming damage for a brief time. they are more of a defensive class, but like the other 2, they have offensive capabilities as well.\\n          - [b]WARLOCK[/b]: the \"mage\", \"wizard\" or well... \"warlock\" of the game. Warlocks are the ones that can heal or empower you in various ways. their powers are for both support and a strong offensive.\\n          - [b]HUNTER[/b]: the \"rogue\" type. simple as that. sneaky and deadly*.\\n\\n*depending on who you ask. :P\\n\\n[u]The Races:[/u]\\n\\nNow, the races don\\'t impact your playstyle all that much (just some occasional dialogue changes in certain Story missions). But based on the lore, I will explain the races for you, in case you are interested in going for any in particular.\\n\\n          - [b]HUMAN[/b]: ...ye. I hope I don\\'t need to elaborate.\\n          - [b]EXO[/b]: an Exo is a robot with a human consciousness inside them. it\\'s not an A.I. or Cyborg. they used to be an actual human before they had their mind transferred into an Exo frame so that they can extend their lifespan indefinitely. they behave the same as a normal human. they can eat, even if they don\\'t need to for survival. it\\'s just for them to keep a semblance of normalcy.\\n          - [b]AWOKEN[/b]: like a human, but purple................................ ok ok ok. it\\'s more that just that. the Awoken were created millennia ago, all at once, when a colony ship on it\\'s way out of the Solar System was caught between a major fight between the forces of Darkness and the Light. from that struggle, the humans onboard were sent through a black/worm hole into another pocket dimension called the Distributary. they were all transformed, imbued with both Light and Dark. thousands of years later, part of those Awoken exited their dimension back into ours, either because they were exiled or because they went on scientific expeditions, while the rest stayed in their homeworld.\\n\\n(I can\\'t make the Exos and the Awokens justice with just these short descriptions, so if you ever get interested in knowing more about them, I recommend you read the lore on them, either in game, on a website called Ishtar Collective, or watch some YouTubers like \"My name is Byf\" or \"Myelin Games\" for fun and indepth lore explanations.)\\n\\n[h1]THE SOCIAL ASPECT:[/h1]\\n\\nMost of the game content is better played with others in a team (or a so called, \"fireteam\" ingame), but you can find enjoyment in being a lone wolf too. You can invite people you see roaming around the social spaces or the various destinations as your friends, but usually you are more likely to get accepted by them if you are doing an activity at the time with said people. I encourage you to make friends, because it gives you so many benefits to your game experience in the long run.\\n\\nNow, there are some CONs in relation with this aspect of the game. One of them is that it\\'s usually hard to find through the game people that want to do the same activity as you. Some of them have matchmaking and there\\'s little to no issues in that. Usually these same activities, but on their harder difficulties, don\\'t have any matchmaking, so you need to go in with a team already formed beforehand. That\\'s were LFG sites or Discord servers come in handy. (I recommend discord.gg/D2LFG, I think it\\'s the actual biggest LFG server for D2.)\\n\\n[h1]QUALITY OF LIFE TOOLS:[/h1]\\n\\n- D2 Companion App (official mobile app that can help you keep track of your pursuits and allow you to get bounties from the ingame vendors without going all the way to them to purchase them)\\n\\n- blueberries.gg (this website will explain more aspects of the game to you if you ever have questions, as a new player)\\n\\n- Destiny Item Manager (DIM) (browser app which is your #1 best friend. it\\'s indispensable for a normal D2 experience)\\n\\n- BrayTech (my favorite app of them all. it can be used to keep track of the progress and timer of your bounties and quests you have in the game at the time, see triumphs and their progress as well, plan what challenges you want to complete in game for better loot. and many more features. you can also customize some areas yourself)\\n\\n- light.gg (website which shows you any item in the game and its commonality. it crowd-sources the perk rolls of any weapon based on what the community uses the most - it\\'s decent for showing you the better rolls, but not necessarily in all situations)\\n\\n[h1]PROs:[/h1]\\n\\n- gunplay, abilities and movement are very satisfying\\n- new content coming often\\n- a huge and varied community, where the parent company (Bungie) encourages community creation and interaction\\n- extensive lore\\n- great endgame content for PvE (dungeons, raids)\\n- TELESTO\\n\\n[h1]CONs:[/h1]\\n\\n- the new player experience is lacking; find experienced players that are willing to help\\n- quite addictive in an unhealthy way\\n- you can enjoy the game without buying anything, but in many cases buying the DLCs feels necessary\\n- DCV (you\\'ll understand)\\n- TELESTO',\n",

       "  'review': 'After probably what is more than 1000 total hours spent playing this game and recommending it to friends, I unfortunately can no longer conscientiously recommend the game to [i]anyone[/i]. This will be a long review below the TL;DR.\\n\\nTL;DR: A predatory 4-layer monetization model, lack of respect for player time investment, removal of past content that you likely paid money for, massive Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) content implementations, player retention mechanics, and heavily skewed update rollouts in favor of slowing player progress over fixing bugs and balance issues.\\n\\n[h1]Monetization - The Big One[/h1]\\nA Bungie employee has confirmed that with the launch of Witch Queen, both dungeons scheduled to release for the duration of the Witch Queen expansion will be sold separately for those who choose not to invest in the digital deluxe version of the game. So, for those who [b]do not[/b] like to preorder games/expansions, which is probably quite a sizeable amount of the playerbase, there will be 3 layers of paywalls in order to play all of the content releasing during Witch Queen. You will be expected to pay the $40 upfront for the expansion, an additional $10 for each of the seasons you choose to purchase (totaling 4 seasons), and another undisclosed amount for each of the 2 dungeons you decide to purchase ($5-20? each). So, in total, if you choose not to purchase the digital deluxe version of the game, you can expect to pay anywhere from $90-120, which doesn\\'t even include the separate Anniversary Pack, which costs an additional $25.\\n\\nOn top of the triple layer content monetization, there is the Eververse store (a cosmetic shop), which is estimated to rake in a few hundreds of millions of dollars each year. \\n\\n[h1]Player Retention, FOMO, and Lack of Respect for Player Investment[/h1]\\nThe games \"seasons\" are designed to keep you coming back to the game each week and keep you playing for as long as possible. Content is trickle-fed to you each week with story updates and seasonal challenge updates. The story additions usually take just a few hours to complete, but the seasonal challenges can take several days to complete each week\\'s new challenges. At the end of the season, if you complete roughly 95% of the season\\'s total challenges, you get a large drop of Bright Dust (free currency for the Eververse store). Large enough, in fact, that it seems like extreme value to attempt to complete the final challenge. But let\\'s say you didn\\'t quite get there and missed out on finishing a few challenges, but the season is over. Can you just complete them later? [b]Nope[/b]. You missed out. [b]Too bad[/b]. Didn\\'t get to see the last bit of the story from the season that just ended? [b]Too bad[/b] (some do persist). Guess you\\'ll need to watch some YouTube videos to figure out what you missed. This alone gives a severe sense of FOMO. You [b]HAVE[/b] to be there for the content or else you\\'ll miss out and it will, quite literally, never come back.\\n\\nBungie has now taken to adjusting gun perks between seasons as well. If you were grinding for that perfect shotgun with the perfect perks, but never quite got it before they decided to change the perk pool, [i]oh well[/i]. Other players now have that perfect roll that may even give them an edge in PvP, but you missed out because your luck wasn\\'t quite good enough.\\n\\nIf you want a particular Trials of Osiris weapon and weren\\'t lucky enough to get it with focused rolls, good luck. Your chances of getting that particular weapon with the perks you want from a randomly rolled Trials engram can range anywhere from 0.02% to 0.1%. You could grind this gamemode for literal days, weeks, maybe even months (since it\\'s only around on particular weekends) and still not get the weapon you want.\\n\\n[h1]The Destiny Content Vault[/h1]\\nAs of right now, all of the original D2 storyline content, as well as the entirety of the first and second expansions to be released for the game, are unplayable, because they have quite literally been removed from the game. With the upcoming release of Witch Queen, the story of The Forsaken expansion will also become fractured as a story essential zone is vaulted. Speaking of Forsaken (which, as I said, will be unplayable in 4 months), Bungie is still, [b]STILL[/b], charging $25 for that expansion. Some people will purchase the expansion for the $25 price point, the expansion will become free in December, frustrating these people, and then the content will be flat out taken away from them on February 22, 2022. Paying for content with the knowledge that you will no longer ever be able to access it sometime in the future is infuriating.\\n\\nThe Destiny Content Vault has led to a completely fragmented new player experience. Which, by the way, the DCV was implemented right after Bungie overhauled the new player experience. A bit counter-productive, right? New and returning players no longer have a connected experience when they play Destiny. They are dropped into the middle of a fragmented world and story that they will only understand by doing homework in the form of watching YouTube videos.\\n\\n[h1]Bugs and The Development Focus/Pipeline[/h1]\\nPlayers have been asking for new Gambit and PvP maps for years. Do they get them? [i]No[/i]. Players have been asking for a Gambit overhaul for years. Has it happened? [i]No[/i]. Sometimes PvP balance gets way out of line and particular guns become exceptionally strong, especially with the right perk roll. Surely it\\'ll get patched quickly, right? [i]No[/i]. In fact, the timeline it takes for balance updates is on the scale of months. Not days. Not weeks. [b]MONTHS[/b].\\n\\nYou know what [b]DOES[/b] get fixed exceptionally quickly? Exploits that interfere with player retention mechanics. Players found a way to quickly farm a resource 10x faster than the intended route? [i]Patched within the hour[/i].\\n\\n[h1]Stockholm Syndrome/Boiling Frog and Sunk Cost Fallacy[/h1]\\nSo, if things are this bad, why are there still so many people playing? I have a few theories and I speak from personal experience.\\n\\nI was victim to sunk cost fallacy. I paid for the digital deluxe editions and when I inevitably got burned out on the game, I would still play the new seasons under the thought process of: \"Oh, I paid for them, I really should play them. Otherwise, I\\'ve wasted my money.\" This is the sunk cost fallacy. \"I\\'ve spent money on this game, I [b]HAVE[/b] to play it to get that value.\" \"I\\'ve invested so much time into this game, I [b]can\\'t[/b] stop playing now or that will have all been for nothing.\" During my stages of burnout, never once did I load up the game actually excited to play, it was only to continue making my investment and to satiate the Fear of Missing Out.\\n\\nThen there is Stockholm Syndrome. People who are literally so addicted to the game that Bungie could make any negative decision in the world and these particular players would still try to justify Bungie\\'s actions. You see this quite clearly with the new dungeon monetization model. \"It\\'s not so bad, it means we may get even higher quality content!\" \"This doesn\\'t matter to me, because I\\'m a diehard Destiny 2 fan who [b]ALWAYS[/b] buys the digital deluxe version of the expansions. Who cares!?\"\\n\\nPlace a frog in a pot of water and slowly increase the temperature until it dies, none the wiser (Boiling Frog). Bungie is doing this by squeezing your wallet with every single piece of content they offer. When season passes became a thing: \"They need the extra money for dev purposes, it\\'s fine.\" Dungeons historically were included with either a season pass or an expansion. Now, that is no longer the case. On one side you have players saying that this is over the line and the other side arguing that \"it isn\\'t so bad, they probably need development money\" (AKA the boiling frogs). Right now, it\\'s dungeons, but who\\'s to say that in another year\\'s time exotic quests (which are also currently included in season passes) won\\'t also be monetized separately?',\n",

       "  'review': \"I wanted to do this for a while.\\nGameplay and (audio-)visual Destiny 2 is an incredible game. The feeling and look of the weapons, how you interact with the world around you is something you’ll find just very rarely. Every Element of the world is visually thought out and the sound design of the game, especially with the newest game extensions just superb. How you can customize your own character can fascinate for hours and lets you tell your own whole story.\\nThought the rest:\\n\\nI started back in December of 2019. A friend asked me if I wanted to join, I never really played an MMO like Destiny 2, so I thought okay, lets give it a try. And I was Instantly hooked.\\nIt was just this mysterious Game where you could explore what felt like an entire star system for itself and just explore the different worlds, each telling a different story.\\nAnd this game had a certain kid of magic. There just was so much to discover, the moment when a Quest for an unknown exotic weapon popped on your screen with special Activities and gorgeous new places bound to it. And oh boy the Raids. The Leviathan Raids were visually just stunning.\\n\\nAnd then, in the November of 2020 Bungie just removed all that magic the game had for me. With the new Beyond Light DLC they decided to remove 40% of the explorable Planets, \\nThey removed activities that just made the game what it was,\\n3 whole campaigns, \\nbeloved activities like 'The Whisper’, ‘Zero Hour' the whole Black Armory and its weapons, and screw it, I even miss the ‘Escalation Protocol’\\n\\nAlso, they went removing 21 of those quest for exotic weapons, that made a huge part of the game,  while leaving 6 in game. Those Weapons are still obtainable in game, though to obtain them you need to grind out in some cases a dozen hours just to get enough materials to buy a certain one.\\nAdditionally they took 5 of the 7 Raids from the game.\\nAnd what they added were 2 Planets, one being a recycled one from the previous game. \\nWith Stasis they gave us a new subclass element, players could abuse, which made the PvP-section of this game the most obnoxious part of the game for 7 Months while fucking up the weapon Meta again.\\nMaybe they achieved to better out the game with new contend and new Ideas coming with each Season?\\n\\nThey did somewhat. I mean they added 2 new exotic Activities to get an exotic weapon from. Now with random rolls and perks. So if you aren’t happy with you EXOTIC WEAPON you need to grind and repeat an activity that is getting repetitive after 3 times.\\nwhile talking about repetitive. \\n\\nThis is the Vendor-thing of season 10\\nhttps://ibb.co/bzXbSJC \\nHere we have one of the 3 main Vendors of the new DLC\\nhttps://ibb.co/0Ff8kyf \\nThe main Vendor of season 12 in some smaller form\\nhttps://ibb.co/ZdQP4zd \\nthe Artifact u need to unlock if you want any seasonal Gear (12) that is not gained randomized\\nhttps://ibb.co/Bt3M8ss \\nand look what we got for the current season (14) again :D\\nhttps://ibb.co/gZVPHnV \\n\\nOf course they added a lot of weapons after they also struggled with this after Beyond Light and tbh, some of the are incredible fun.\\n But hey, we got the 6 new rewards for one of the pinnacle activities of the game,“Nightfalls” \\n\\n all of them being old, recycled Destiny 1 weapons with 2 more incoming.\\n\\nThe Raid added with the beginning of Season 14 is returning one from D1.\\nThe weapons added for one of the harder PvP modes, Iron Banner, in the last 4 seasons are 2 new designed and 8 being recycled back from the earlier days of this game.\\n\\nBut I have to admit that it is pretty hard to come up with new content consistently for 4 years now, especially with a new season coming every 3-4 months. \\nAnd its not like they didn’t delivered content, we got a really good new raid, a slowly growing base of good and creative activities and a high new arsenal of powerful and just enjoyable weapons.\\n\\nI just personally feel like this game just isn’t about the fun, the world itself anymore, \\nthe whole goal of players now is to get a high enough light-level to do something they did in the past season already, just to instantly start grinding for the next season’s level-cap again.\\nMost of the weapons you'll find, will get dusted in your vault at some point.\\n\\nThat all is why I really don't want to recommend this game anymore, it is just grinding in its purest form, and everything about this game has just got so repetitive.\\nBut to be honest the game might just have burnt me out on a personal level.\\n\\nThere is one magical thing that survived all of Destiny’s Lifetime and is the reason I am launching the game at certain days. The Community.\\nThe Community is what makes this game maybe so special. I met incredible people, made friendships and began to love the playerbase. There may be some cheaters in the PvP parts of the game and in some rare cases people who get toxic, but the playerbase in the most parts just is so incredible wholesome, helpful and cooperative.\\n\\nTho after all I am thankful for all the memories I could make with that whole thing\\nI just want to thank everybody, I am happy that I met all of you :)\\n\\n\\nhave a good one y’all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe fun thing about this whole rant is that, almost a year ago, even before BL released another D1-Vet left the game and told me that he just felt like the game has gotten too grindy and repetitive.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Forsaken gave me hope that Destiny 2 would finally achieve the greatness that Destiny 1 was after it\\'s last DLC. Even more so, when Bungie finally split with Activision which made me think at first that everything is going to be great from now on. I thought Shadowkeep was not just going to be a good DLC, but also a positive turning point for the series so I immediately bought the entire Season Pass bundle. But sadly Destiny has disappointed me much more than it has positively surprised me\\n\\nThe new Seasons just suck. The new \"content\" isn\\'t content, let alone new content. You basically are just playing old stuff to earn old stuff with a few new things mixed in. Season Passes should ATLEAST come with a Strike, Crucible Map and a Gambit Map. Even that is such a bare minimum but instead we get to grind Bounties which is definitely the type of grind I\\'ve been always looking for. The \"new content\" is either just a new horde mode or gear that they recycled from Destiny 1 and if they add actual new gear that also looks cool, it almost always is something from the Eververse. Taking for example with Shadowkeep\\'s launch. We have the launch of a new raid: Garden of Salvation. A Garden Vex based raid that has us fighting our way through the mysterious black garden from D1. Within it we get a RESKINNED set of armour, a new exotic weapon quest, some kinetic and energy weapons and god fucking forbid why there is no heavy weapons is beyond me. A very below average loot pool I would say for a newly released expansion raid. However, there is no ship, no sparrow and no ghost within this raid. Except what should be considered the ship and sparrow for this raid is locked behind the premium tier of the season pass. And a Vex Harpy Ghost shell \"Harper\\'s Shell\" can be purchased from EVERVERSE. Why wasn\\'t any of this moved to help fill the absence of loot in a end game activity. Honestly there needs to be some kind of respect put towards these cosmetics Bungie. If you are designing something that is themed to a certain activity or season, don\\'t hide it behind a Eververse paywall and actually put it down as a earnable reward in activites. It shows that we have gone and earned them through either a loot drop in a end game activity or like you\\'ve done before, certain high tier triumphs so as they are not as rng loot dependant. Why not have the Thorn ornament as a reward for solo flawless, creates a sense of..........pride and accomplishment for doing so, rather then just an emblem. Before finishing this review I quickly just want to point out a few other things\\n-Surprisingly small Trials pool with the armor being yet another reskin.\\n-No ritual weapons.\\n-Quite a lot of hackers\\n-More error codes than you could humanly count\\n-Still no vendor refresh.\\n-This season is a bounty simulator, again.\\n-Strikes are STILL useless after YEARS of feedback.\\n-Another season without a raid with no word of how often we can expect them or even when we can expect the next one.\\n-Eververse seems to get the most attention. Looks like the only balance bungie really cares about is the one for my bank account.\\n-Just the general amount and quality of content is lacking.\\n\\nIt honestly feels like Destiny 2 has been in a slow decline since they parted ways with Activision, because at that time they got someone to put pressure on them to make actual content. Wether the content was good or not, it was still content and not hours of Bounty grinding, which doesn\\'t mean that I want them back because the Eververse is already bad enough.\\n\\nEdit: The new event \"Guardian Games\" is about deciding which Class is the best one, not by doing challenges that take skill and would be fun, but by boring bounty grinding. Bungie is really putting a hell lot of effort into these huh ?',\n",

       "  'review': \"Edit: This review was written before Witch Queen launched and was initially negative, I still stand behind most of what I said, without a DLC to hold your hand it will be rough as a new player.\\n\\nBut if you were on the fence, I can wholeheartedly recommend buying the Witch Queen DLC and jumping in right now. The campaign is absolutely amazing and is a perfect start for new players. It offers backstory/lore, a great villain, a challenge (on legendary) and an actually interesting story.\\n\\nBut most importantly, even if you don't buy the DLC, you no longer have to grind for 20+ hours to enter the Vault of Glass raid. You could try out some of the best content Destiny has to offer, straight away, although I would advise getting some gear first.\\n\\n\\n\\n- - - [h1]OLD REVIEW[/h1] - - - \\n\\n[h1]Become Legend[/h1]\\n\\n[h1]Preface[/h1]\\nAt the time of writing, I have spent 2437 (1580 + 857 orbit) hours in total on Destiny 2, since the Warmind expansion in 2018. There is only one other game I’ve spent more time on.\\n\\nThis game has given me some of the best gaming experiences I’ve had and probably will keep doing so: doing the campaigns with friends, my first underleveled nightfall as a kinderguardian (read new player), being carried through the first weekend of Whisper (thanks Java), farming EP for Ikelos-SG, my first raid (thanks Mortais), making friends, sherpa-ing others, participating and failing the day 1 LW, getting LH, getting the Rivensbane seal, going blind into the dungeons on day 1 with friends, solo flawlessing all dungeons, getting a week one completion in the CoS and GoS raid, lowmanning Levi/EoW/CoS, earning Not Forgotten and the Unbroken seal, scrims, going flawless, forming a proper team to stay up all night and get the day 1 completion for both DSC and VoG…\\n\\nWith that all said, how could I not recommend others to start playing and ‘become legend’ too? The game is great, gunplay/music/areas amazing, loot and community mostly good.\\nWhat’s not to like?\\n\\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\\nThe highest highs go paired with the lowest lows. Destiny 2 is hard to get into nowadays, don’t be fooled by the F2P tag, the ‘new light’ (read new player) experience is bad and doesn’t resemble the full experience in the slightest. \\n\\nThere are a lot of unexplained mechanics, everything can feel overwhelming at first, and then at some point you probably realize that there’s nothing left to do except grind strikes, crucible and gambit for the foreseeable future. Strikes turn stale fast, crucible is where new lights get extinguished and gambit is gambit. You might discover the Prophecy dungeon at some point, which might be a brick wall for some, but definitely fun for a couple clears. So what now?\\n\\n[strike]Wait, the F2P raid, the crème de la crème, Vault of Glass?! Well, first you have to grind all the way up from level 1100, to the soft-cap at 1270, grind powerful rewards for a couple weeks until you reach 1310-1320. All in all probably around 25-30 hours’ worth of doing the same activities over and over. This isn’t bad per se, but once you reach 1270 the grind slows down hard. As a new player back in 2018 I hated seeing my progression be time gated.\\n\\nWithout any dlc to hold your hand, this will be a rough and boring grind.[/strike] See edit, this no longer counts\\n\\n[h1]The worst[/h1]\\nSo you’ve made it through the entire grind, finished your first raid and are thinking about checking out the paid content.\\nWhile the money/spent-time ratio is pretty decent imo, and the campaigns can help guide new players in a fun way, do be prepared to spend quite some money and time.\\n[list]\\n    [*]Forsaken: 25€ -> Shattered Throne + Last Wish raid\\n    [*]Shadowkeep: 25€ -> Pit of Heresy + Garden of Salvation raid\\n    [*]Beyond Light: 40€ -> Deep Stone Crypt raid\\n[/list]\\t\\nWith upcoming:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Anniversary Dungeon: 25€\\n    [*]Witch Queen: 40€ OR Witch Queen + 4 seasons + 2 dungeons: 80€\\n[/list]\\t\\nIn total you’re looking at 80€ for the current content and another 100€ for upcoming. This alone can be a hard sell, so definitely don’t buy everything at once, maybe check out Forsaken or Beyond Light, try a single season, buy only Witch Queen on 22feb. \\nDo be warned though that content you paid for can and will disappear sometime in the future. The Forsaken campaign will leave in February. Previously we’ve lost 3 campaigns, 2 dungeons and 5 raids.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nI love the game and will keep playing it for the time being. But I can’t recommend it to new players, because it’s a mess.\\n\\nAs a new light you’ll need someone to hold your hand and even then it’ll be rough. I’d tell you it’s worth it in the end, but odds are against you, I’ve had way more friends give up on Destiny than get into it, currently sitting at 9 to 1.\\nIf you do decide to go for it, good luck, welcome to the community, join a clan, enjoy your firsts.\",\n",

       "  'review': '(Bungie fell from grace and added a shitty Battle Pass and have upped their microtransaction-game.)\\n\\nIf I were to describe Destiny 2 in a single sentence it would be: repeat infinitely, achieve nothing.\\n\\nDestiny 2 will never allow you to feel powerful. No matter how much you play, you will always be as strong as everyone else. No matter how long you spend grinding bounties, how many raids you do and how many dungeons you do you will never feel like you achieved anything. Every gun, every piece of armor is so similar, the biggest difference between them is how they look. And to make matters worse, shotguns, snipers and other more powerful guns have so little ammo, that there\\'s no point in using them. It\\'s usually quicker to just kill the enemies with your main gun than to swap and take 5 shots with a somewhat better gun.\\n\\nFor the same reasons you can only equip a single piece of exotic armor and  a single exotic weapon at once. It\\'s not because they\\'re any good, but it\\'s because if you could actually equip some of those cool pieces of gear you spent a hundred hours getting you would feel like you achieved something. Exotic powers range from making you run a little faster, to throwing grenades a bit farther, to giving energy to people around you wearing the same exotic. On their own, they\\'re so weak, almost none of them are worth using. It\\'s the same with guns. Some of them are actually good, but you can only equip one, so why bother grinding for more of them? Why bother doing the missions and challenges you paid for when they only give you a good gun you will never use? So few of the exotics are worth using, there\\'s no point in grinding for them. (Most of them are random drops, so you can\\'t actually even grind for them).\\n\\nDestiny 2 is a game for people who loves doing the same thing over and over again. \"Kill 10 Vex\" \"Kill 10 Vex on Mars\" \"Kill 10 Cabal on Nessus\" \"Go stand over there for a bit\" \"Do that dungeon again 3 times, but with harder enemies\". None of the missions give you anything good, anyways. Some glimmer and XP, and sometimes a gun or armor you will use for 5 minutes until you get one with a higher Power Level. It\\'s a waste of time. \\n\\nGo play Borderlands 3 instead. It actually lets you feel a bit of the power and fun you grind for, and weapons are actually unique.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Came for the dancing, stayed for the respawn simulator. Anyway, been wanting to play Destiny ever since it was first released. Happy to say I am not disappointed. I suck at absolutely everything there is, but it's fun. And even more so if you have someone to play with. Probably the first game I don't want to solo.\\n\\nEDIT:\\nMy feelings about this game have changed a lot since I wrote this review. I hate Destiny. I hate this game with a passion. I hate bungo, actually. The game has so much potential, but with every change it feels like they're trying to run it into the ground with laziness and changes that make zero sense to anyone. \\nAND YET \\nI can't stop playing. It's not even addiction, trust me. I said in my first review that ''it's better when you have someone to play with'' and that was when I played with people I knew from before. But now it got a whole new meaning as I'm actually meeting new people through the game and playing it literally only because of those people. As someone with social anxiety, I never thought I'd live to see myself use voice chat. It used to be the same as a death sentence. I am not joking! \\n\\nIn a way, I can say this game helped me a lot. Never understood the interest people have in co-op and multiplayer, but I think I see it now. Not everyone is a toxic asshole you want to slap out of existence. Some people are genuinely friendly and fun. Nothing relaxes me more after work than starting D2 up and doing literally anything, even idling in Tower and pushing whoever's afk off of it to their death, in good company.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I am 41 years old and probably one of the oldest players on Apex Legends servers. I have to say I enjoy this game a lot. I have been playing FPS games since the original Doom, and I played Unreal Tournament (UT) and Quake 3 a lot when they were launched on 1999. To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS. \\nThis is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation,  good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay. I am married with children and still try to play a few games every night since I found this gem. And best part, it is FREE!! You should definitely give it a try.',\n",

You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.\\n\\n10/10. Def recommend\",\n",

The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game.

       "  'review': \"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.\",\n",

Warzone is way too sweaty, PUBG's the engine lag is too unforgivable, Fortnite is too goofy, and Danger Zone has too little to offer.\\n\\nThe movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.\\n\\nThe legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can.  And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.\\n\\nif you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about. Thank you EA. You truly have the reverse Midas touch, where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo.\",\n",

Good characters with fun abilities and cool stories set in the Titanfall universe, great gunplay with incredible movement possibilities and great feeling of teamwork in trios. Easily sank around 300hrs into the game on origin and now switched to steam, recommended.\",\n",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

       "  'review': \"[h1] ♦️ Apex Legends [/h1]\\n[b] Apex Legends [/b] is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, [b] Apex Legends [/b] proves it is here to stay.\\n\\n[h1] Monetization [/h1]\\n→ Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.\\n\\n[h1] Gunplay [/h1]\\n→ Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.\\n\\n→ One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes. \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992578590\\n[h1] Game Modes[/h1]\\n→ Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.\\n\\n[h1] Movement [/h1]\\n→ Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance. \\n\\n[h1] Looting [/h1]\\n→ A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme. \\n\\n→ Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.\\n\\n→ There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well. \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992381162\\n[h1] Roster [/h1]\\n→ With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992381274\\n[h1] Map Design [/h1]\\n→ There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.\\n\\n[h1] Visuals & Sound [/h1]\\n→ Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards. \\n\\n→ The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying [b] boom [/b]. The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.\\n\\n[h1] ♦️ Conclusion [/h1]\\nApex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an [b] Auto [/b] play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play. \\n[h3] Overall Score 9/10 [/h3]\\n\\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\",\n",

I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.\\n\\n[b][u]General Comment and recommendations :[/u][/b] \\n- Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth. So a big thumps up for that.\\n\\n\\nAnyways thanks for reading my review, I am still playing it and love it everyday. Cheers!!!',\n",

       "  'review': 'Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Excellent Movement.\\n- Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good.\\n- Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion.\\n - New legends and weapons added every season.\\n- Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh.\\n- Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass.\\n- Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season\\'s battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted).\\n- Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc.\\n- You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !)\\n- Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! )\\n- Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18.\\n- In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming.\\n- Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is \"we are working on it\" etc.\\n- Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets.\\n- Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can\\'t even get into a game.\\n\\n- SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3  and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.\\n\\nThe main reason why I can\\'t recommend this game to new players is because I don\\'t see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don\\'t have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.\\n\\nAt the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don\\'t play these types of games - they\\'re just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are [i]really[/i] into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I\\'ve formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.\\n\\n[h1]Do I think Apex Legends is good?[/h1]\\nHonestly...yes. I do. I didn\\'t expect it but I\\'ve been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that\\'s enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nThere are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let\\'s break them down point by point.\\n\\n- [b]Gun play[/b]\\nThe guns in Apex are [i]satisfying[/i] to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I\\'d choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say \"hey I died but I had fun\".\\nNot everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can\\'t just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying.\\nOn top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don\\'t think they work very well and they aren\\'t anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there\\'s memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it\\'s because they just really don\\'t fit in with the way this game wants you to play it.\\nTo clarify - I\\'m not saying they\\'re useless, I\\'m just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.\\n\\n- [b]Abilities[/b]\\nThis game\\'s abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren\\'t integrated into gameplay properly. It\\'s the one thing that I dislike about this game being that  you have no idea what you\\'re getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once.\\nBut perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they\\'re conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not.\\nOverall though, I appreciate that this game doesn\\'t make it so you [i]need[/i] to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you [i]can[/i] use if you need it.\\n\\n- [b]Movement[/b]\\nI love this game\\'s movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it\\'s no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels [i]really good[/i] and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter.\\nThe only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it\\'s super satisfying but [i]man[/i] does it feel awkward initially.\\n\\n[h1]Monetization:[/h1]\\nThis is a free-to-play game, it\\'s natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they\\'ve created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how\\'s the monetization in this game? Honestly I\\'m incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.\\n\\n- [b]DLC[/b]\\nThe DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I\\'m hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it\\'s just a shame altogether - I\\'d personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.\\n\\n- [b]Lootboxes[/b]\\nI think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I\\'m not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I\\'ve gathered they don\\'t do limited-time lootbox drops so they\\'re avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they\\'re there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.\\n\\n- [b]Battle Pass[/b]\\nThis is one thing I actively dislike about this game\\'s monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like \"Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin\", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you \"buy premium to get this skin!\", at which point I just wanna tell the game to fuck off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics, Sound & Optimization:[/h1]\\nHow are the other aspects of the game?\\n\\n- [b]Graphics[/b]\\nFor being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching.\\nSome gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It\\'s not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.\\n\\n- [b]Sound[/b]\\nThe sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying.\\nThe music isn\\'t anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don\\'t really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about.\\nThe voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.\\n\\n- [b]Optimization[/b]\\nI think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn\\'t seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it\\'s just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\nThere are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it\\'s satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn\\'t recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say \"thats just a skill issue\" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex\\'s skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level.\\nI hope this review is helpful.\\nsincerely, a concerned player.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] The Best Battle Royale on the Market with some Faults [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n+ Smoothest Movement\\n+ Satisfying gunplay\\n+ Every animation & sound effect is so distinct, you can tell where and what is coming towards you.\\n+ Stressful but rewarding final circles in Ranked\\n+ Crossplay with friends on consoles (Nintendo Switch players are free kills)\\n+ Easy to complete battle pass within a month of playtime.\\n+ Beautiful maps such as Olympus & Stormpoint to the sweaty competitive maps, World's Edge & King's Canyon.\\n\\n[b] Neutral: [/b]\\n- Shares the same universe as Titanfall but the lore is okayish.\\n- I honestly think Apex has the worst cosmetic team next to Halo Infinite. Some of them are really just nice but exclusive to the battle pass or collection events. If you do find a really good skin that isn't a recolor of the default model, be ready to shell out 18/35/50 dollars up to 160+. It's honestly a cycle with this game, you get 3 seasons of good skins and 3 seasons of mediocre or trash skins.\\n- Pro games have teams compete against full mouse & keyboard vs full controller or a mix of both inputs in an endless battle that blends so well together.\\n- If you don't like the battle royale mode, there is a lite economy round based 3v3 mode to mess around in called Arenas.\\n- Limited time game modes like Control (Domination if you ever played COD) should be in the base game.\\n- Like every modern game today, the matchmaking system pits you against or with pro players, new players, or the average 2 hour free time guy.\\n- Since the game is free to play, there's lootboxes, completely random. Some get Heirlooms Shards (0.2% chance of dropping) early on, while it took me 800 hours. Heirloom Shards are for melee weapons or prestige Legends skins that do not affect gameplay. There is a bunch of crap in the lootboxes to further your chances of not getting what you want.\\n- Characters aside from the default roster need to be bought with in game currency or real money. They also cannot be tested in the firing range.\\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n- Somehow there's a game breaking bug every season.\\n- Squads/Quads (teams of 4) doesn't exist, leaving that one friend all alone while the rest play Trios. Nor is there a true solos mode.\\n- Servers are really bad causing desyc/bullets aren't registering, crashing, or disconnects.\\n- Enemy footsteps sometimes doesn't work.\\n- Joke of an esport; the recent ALGS 2022 had players dc, visas denied, teams teleporting across the map and dying to their deaths, or players gettings covid - forcing teams to play as a duo instead as a trio. The tournament organizers didn't want to restart despite all these problems. Also they didn't even play on LAN?? The event was connected to the nearest server. Even the custom matches for pros to scrim in, didn't work for a while.\\n- The balancing or design team whatever you want to call them is very questionable. You have 2 Legends, Seer & Valkyrie dominating tournaments without a single nerf in sight meanwhile, Lifeline's old shield passive was reworked into a new Legend, we have two of the same character now. Which leads onto my next point, a few characters share the same ability just slightly different. Sooner or later the game will become a massive unbalancing mess than it already is. Then finally, some Legends that need a buff stay untouched for a very long time.\\n- Easy anti-cheat would sometimes blue screen my computer or crash my game back to the desktop once in a blue moon. \\n- The lack of a spectating system without going into match or a dedicated match history.\\n\\n[h1] Recommended Youtube / Twitch Content [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Pro Mouse and Keyboard [/b]\\n- ImperialHal, Reps, Albralelie, HisWattson, Apryze, Sweetdreams, Hardecki, Nafen, Taisheen, Mande, sYnceD, Monsoon, Rogue\\n\\n[b] Movement Gods [/b]\\n- Aceu, Stormen, Taxi2g, Faide, Crylix\\n\\n[b] Pro Controller Demons [/b]\\n- ChaoticMuch, Verhulst, Daltoosh, Staynaughty, Knoqd, Pandxrz, Snip3down, Thekine\\n\\n[b] Casual / Funny [/b]\\n- Rag Tagg, Lej, Emerald Gemerald & the butt load of vtubers on Apex\\n\\n[b] Informative [/b]\\n- TheGamingMerchant, Mokeysniper, & ottr\\n\\n[b] Fan Animations [/b]\\n- Cheetah, Tooncraft, Hoxdolum, & dopatwo\",\n",

       "  'review': \"So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.\\n\\nWithin 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.\\n\\nAte some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.\\n\\nI slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.\\n\\nThen I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.\\n\\nIts now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.\\n\\nIn a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn\\'t even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn\\'t considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \\n\\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don\\'t need to go around killing players who haven\\'t had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.',\n",

If you like desperately trying to avoid getting ghosted by groups of geared player-killers while clawing your way into position as top dog, there's a server for that. If you like building a great base and only fighting other players in specific areas, there's a server for that. If you like fighting off zombies while never having to deal with getting raided or offlined, there's a server for that. The graphics are intense and visceral, yet also beautiful, while the crafting and building are pretty intuitive once you get used to the system. For your first run I would suggest a specifically newb friendly server until you get used to things, otherwise it will just be lots of dying and rage quitting and you will miss an excellent survival shooter.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The description Steam gives of Rust on this page is misleading. It is a survival game only in the sense that other players will kill you. They will kill you for any reason, and probably call you a ni**er too. You will rage quit. You will wonder why you even bought the game. But it keeps drawing you back. How can i make my base more secure? How can i protect all my loot that i worked for hours or days to collect? You will turn the game on only to find you've been killed and everything you have is gone. You start yet again on the beach with nothing but a rock. This isn't a game, its an anxiety and anger inducer filled with racists and masochists playing out their fantasies.This game brings out the absolute worst of the human spirit. You will either love this game or hate it. There is no in between. Don't let well produced youtube videos mislead you on what to expect out of this game. This isn't a pick up and play game, you need to consistently sink time in to get anywhere. Before work, after work, before you go to sleep, hell, even set an alarm in the middle of the night if you have to (it wont matter, your base got raided, ni**er). 10/10 this is the worst best game I've ever played.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Before you scroll down and read the rest.. let me say one thing: \"Rust is a high risk, high reward -type of game, if you get salty every time you die.. then move along.. this game isn\\'t for you\". [/h1]\\n_______________________________\\n\\n[h1][b]General game information [/b][/h1]\\n\\nThis game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.\\n\\nObviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n[h1][b]My experience [/b][/h1]\\n\\nAt the time of writing this review i\\'ve been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.\\nAfter figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn\\'t.\\nFor some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.\\nThis resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn\\'t for the feint of heart.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n[h1][b]State of the Game [/b][/h1]\\n\\nWhen you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to \"Legacy\" being the best state of the game, I disagree.\\nThe current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.\\nThese are named: [b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b].\\nMost Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn\\'t get any love.\\nA week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier.\\n[b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b] - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n[h1][b]The pros [/b][/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]If you use a microphone, you will have the most fun and random interactions you have ever experienced.\\n[*]There\\'s a lot of ways to express your creativity. Basebuilding, gearsets, drawing penisses on other peoples bases.\\n[*]There is no real endgame, so you can set your own goals. Trust me when I say that those can be very rewarding.\\n[*]Its a great game for Youtube content (has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)\\n[*]Its a great game for Twitch content (has a streamer mode to hide from streamsnipers, has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)\\n[*]As a big community that really loves the game, but for the most part is filled with toxic players. (Like any other game these days)\\n[*]The game is constantly being developed. Weekly changes+additions with every patch.\\n[*]The game also has a great Dev team, they are hardworking and very dedicated\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1][b]The cons [/b][/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]It has a big learning curve. The first thing you need to do is join a empty server and start figuring stuff out cause on a populated server you will get punished for it.\\n[*]A lot of people KoS in the current state of the game, which is fine for me cause im used to it. But if you are new it can be very offputting.\\n[*]The game has a very annoying memoryleak that will cause problems no matter how much GB you got in that godlike computer of yours. (they are working on it)\\n[*]Deciding on the correct server for you to join will directly affect how much fun the game is for you as a soloplayer.\\n[*]The official servers are terrible. There is hardly ever a admin in there to counteract a possible cheater. My advice: Stick to the community servers.\\n[*]The game uses a day/night cycle. During the night it truly is pitchblack and you wont be able to see a thing. Unless you have Nvidia, then you can just fire up the gamma and you\\'ll be fine. Especially vs people that have a AMD graphics card. Its a annoying problem in the game thats currently being looked into.\\n[/list]\\n_______________________________\\n\\n[h1][b]The future isn\\'t set in stone. [/b][/h1]\\n\\nWell, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I\\'ve seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n[h1][b]Conclusion [/b][/h1]\\n\\nIf you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I\\'ve had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game.\\n_______________________________\\n\\n[h1][b]Side note [/b][/h1]\\n\\nI\\'m working on a really big tutorial for this game. So if you are interested in that.. please check out my profile and subscribe to my youtube page. If not, I hope this review helped you a bit. Im not a professional reviewer or anything of the sorts. I\\'m just giving you my two cents about the game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Rust isn\\'t about building a pretty fort with your friends, logging out and then coming back tomorrow to pick up where you left off. No, Rust is about psychology. I have watched a bunch of naked men with rocks rove the hillside in search of the \"clothed\" and kill mercilessly. I have watched people come together over d*ck paintings they created together. Sometimes you will join a server and there is a small group that take everything and leave nothing. You might even be taken prisoner or trapped and then taunted until eventually it is too much and you give up on life. Much like real life there are good people and bad people. If you take games too seriously, you won\\'t enjoy this. This is survival of the numbers and occasionally survival of the most clever. Never give up, never give in, it all starts with a rock.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I woke up in the grass, my head hurting and my body cold. I was naked.\\n\\nI ran around, looking for a fellow survivor. After an hour, I saw him. I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around. \\n\\nWe greeted each other, and agreed to work together.\\n\\nAfter a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.\\n\\nOne day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.\\n\\nI looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left. \\n\\nThe next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.\\n\\nLater that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.\\n\\nIt was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.\\n\\nThe next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.\\n\\nI was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.\\n\\nThey said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen. \\n\\nThen the war began.\\n\\nThey got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.\\n\\nLuckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.\\n\\nAfter a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.\\n\\nMy friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.\\n\\nThey eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well. \\n\\nIt was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.\\n\\nTo this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?\\n\\nI'm surviving.\\n\\nStories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game. Although the glitches are a bit annoying, you get used to it.\\n\\n9/10\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Things to know about Rust:[/h1]\\n\\n[b]ZERGS[/b]: (aka big groups) can stomp all over you because of sheer number advantage and the rate they can progress through the wipe. Zergs are especially powerful after they implemented the group update where you can see your teammates blips which means you dont have to call for a jump check anymore.\\n\\n[b]NOT NOOB FRIENDLY[/b]: Very, very, very, few people you meet will be friendly. Normally, anyone you meet with any type of weapon will be hostile. You'll even see nakeds fight you with their rock when you spawn.\\n\\n[b]PLAY WITH FRIENDS[/b]: Can't emphasise this enough. Having atleast one other person to play with is all you need. There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner.\\n\\n[b]YOU WILL DIE[/b]: You will die with all the loot in the world, many, many, times. Even more so if you try to play solo. I don't want to say solo is impossible, hJune shows us that, (and lots of other rust youtubers) but for new players its a no go.\\n\\n[b]TIME INVESTING[/b]: The people who play the most have the best results. As in a person who plays 10 hours a day, everyday, for the entire wipe, will get much further than someone who plays a couple hours a day. If you don't have lots of time on your hand to play, I wouldn't play at all.\\n\\n[b]TOXIC COMMUNITY[/b]: With any game, there is a fairly toxic community. Half the fights you win with a gun, your opponent usually makes fun of you for how many shots you missed and how much gunpowder you wasted, but I find this funny.\\n\\n[b]HACKERS[/b]: Mostly on offical servers, so i suggest for you to play on community servers such as solo/duo/trio. Only problem is community servers die quicker than official servers.\\n\\n[b]EXPERIENCE[/b]: Once you learn the ropes, it becomes a really fun game with intense moments and great fights.\",\n",

Let your kid set the destination, or decide to attack a base, or a ship and just have fun being naked survivalists for an evening. I take the role of a base builder and keep us on our feet, he likes shooting weapons and is an excellent shot.\\n\\nAn awesome game to bond over, and a great way to talk about how to not be a jerk online, how to deal with disappointment, how to work as a team when you make alliances, and how to be a gracious winner. He loves to help new players, will upend a planned evening to help some newbie with starting gear. Great game to play with your kids.\",\n",

I have sent EAC numerous emails, logged a number of tickets... and even created a Reddit post (which the admin quickly deleted) and they still refuse to investigate my case. \\n\\nIt\\'s now 240+ days since my ban and I\\'ve officially given up!

       "  'review': 'Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I\\'ve ever played. You are naked and alone on the world\\'s silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you\\'ve also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you\\'re particularly industrious, you\\'ll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone\\'s throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources—the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.\\n\\nBut then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It\\'s another idiot in Rust. \\n\\nI don\\'t know what it is with this game. Maybe it\\'s the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it\\'s the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it\\'s the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you\\'re spotted by an idiot, you\\'ll start hearing the shit-talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you\\'re hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.\\n\\nIt\\'s so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn\\'t love it. I wish I could say that it didn\\'t feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn\\'t know I was carrying), and put him down with a single well-placed strike. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I didn\\'t laugh my ass off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, \"Hey man, wait a second!\" I wish I could say I didn\\'t kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn\\'t mean that as an endorsement.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Rust, Rust, Rust, where do I begin. Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what you\\'re getting yourself into.\\n\\nWell, first off, Rust is a game of \"Survival\". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute dickhead. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I\\'ll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don\\'t want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a \"raid-proof\" home. And once your home is finished, you\\'ll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.\\n\\nRust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I\\'ve been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.\\n\\nI would reccomend these tactics for staying alive:\\n- Play \"Native American\" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little\\n- Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they\\'ll think you\\'re poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold. \\n- Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you\\'re the first person to start on a brand new island\\n- TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight\\n- Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly\\'s who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people\\n- Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can\\'t build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies.\\n- Raid a few homes yourself. I\\'m generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let\\'s face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven\\'t already, and you can\\'t trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren\\'t followed. \\n\\nGood luck and happy hunting',\n",

I put \"DayZ\" as a relateable game, but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared, other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i\\'d suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing. \\n\\n[h1]Score[/h1]\\n60/100\\n\\n[i](If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)[/i]',\n",

       "  'review': 'Before I start I would like to say on my old acc, I had about 2000 hours on rust and I have been playing since it first came out, I also will be merging my old review from a while back with a new one, enjoy.\\n\\nRust is a game that delivers as a true survival experience. In Rust you may choose to play alone or with others to survive, build, and loot. The game is at its best on its community servers as the official ones tend to be overly crowded and very intense for a beginner. In Rust you spawn in a random area of the very large map with nothing at your disposal but a rock, a torch, and bandages (Depending on the Server). With that rock you begin your seemingly overwhelming journey of gathering supplies, supplies allow you to create tools, and buildings. From there most players choose to explore their surroundings and upgrade their defenses.\\n\\nThis game while enthralling is a time consumer and requires a lot of your attention, other players can kill you and loot your corpse. I\\'ve spent hours upon my intitial spawn working in a community of players building a small city and upgrading to metal walls. We traded supplies, hunted together, looted nearby rad towns, and even slowly accepted new players into our ranks. Our small group had become a society, we aided those who needed help and defended our small city from other players masked as bandits. We had come to know each other by first names and trusted that our things be safe while not ingame, as there was always another player on watching over your city.\\n\\nThis game is perhaps the first game to create a challenging but engaging true to life experience. Things I had never experienced in a game before such as trying to decide amongst your fellow founding members if the lone newbie could be trusted behind our walls? Do we let him in? Should we make him bunk in the Newbie quarters overnight until he pulls his own weight? Are our walls truly safe? Who should be allowed to carry rifles? How can we expand our society and truly be able to keep our loot safe? All of these questions come into play at any given point.\\n\\nPlay with the right people, on the right server, and you too can have this experience. As for that society? What led to our unavoidable demise? One lone player trusted behind our walls was able to level everything in just a few hours. That is part of the game though, that experience, is what defined for me what games should be aiming to deliver a one of a kind experience I can experience nowhere else.\\n\\nYour experience may vary, your story may differ, but mine definitely enables me to recommend this game to the average player.\\n\\nIf you enjoy working hard at something, having a totally different survival experience, definitely buy this game.\\n\\nRUST is the best PC community game I have ever played.\\nThis game is the truest test of character I\\'ve seen in no other game before.. Some days you will meet the scummiest, most foul, and toxic players/people. They will make you want to quit playing, and they will ruin your day. BUT for every one \"P.O.S.\" you meet, there are three wonderful people & potential teammates just waiting to cross paths with you. I have met and made some great friendships from this game, that have carried on to other games as well. This game can open new doors and opportunities. I went from being a solo player on RUST, to a Leader of a 50+ player gaming clan & Discord server where we play a variety of other games. You get whatever you put into this game. It can be time consuming and frustrating. It will either pay off, or it won\\'t. That\\'s RUST for ya.\\nNow, I suggest you start with playing the game the way it was intended (vanilla), not because it will make you better at the other versions/servers, because it won\\'t.. It\\'s just to get you used to the grind. getting used to the grind will make modded servers much more loose and fun to play on. Also, if you advance pretty fast in Vanilla, you will advance much faster in Modded. That being said... People who play *only* Vanilla servers, and those playing *only* Modded servers are an entirely different breed. Being great at Vanilla, and making \"plays\" left & right, DOES NOT mean you can do the same thing on Modded servers. So don\\'t puff your chest too much and walk into new territory thinking your hot stuff, cause you can easily get made into hot dog crap by players who know the play-style of that server far better than you do.\\n\\nThis game is easily 10/10 for me.\\nThere may be some bugs, but they end up being more funny than annoying in my opinion.\\nThe Developers are SO AMAZING. they releasing free updates monthly, they do seasonal/holiday events in-game, and they have been making DLC for those who like to Role-Play as well. They feature content in community-updates that showcase artwork, Youtube videos, and idea\\'s by players just like you. This game is so great because they listen to your feedback and implement changes or content into the game based off of what the community wants. Going as far as putting a trumpet in a turret. (Turrrumpet! - Shadowfrax) It\\'s our game, they are just making it for us. LOL\\n\\nYoutube videos are a great way to help you get situated and will help you better understand the game if you want to know more about it.\\nIf you\\'re looking for tips on building I suggest Youtubers: My Gaming Experience, & Evil Wurst\\nIf you want to watch good players fight and try to survive I suggest Youtubers: Blooprint, & Jordan Rants\\nIf you want to watch seriously great scripted stories set in Rust, I suggest none other than: Frost. (<--Seriously amazing)\\nIf you want to see Craziness and the Hilarious insanity of RUST, I suggest you checkout: Mr Memio \\nIf you want to keep up-to-date on everything RUST, subscribe to: ShadowFrax\\n\\nI wish you good luck on your travels! I\\'ll see you in game, and remember..\\nRUST Karma is *very* real.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game has ruined my life. I have never felt more isolated from my friends and family and feel more depressed than ever before. I have slept with my headset on every night for the past 3 years causing the bone structure in my skull to be permanently damaged. I get 3 and a half hours of sleep every night which resulted in a rare disorder where my height is stunted and i am unable to digest food. I weigh about 75 pounds and im 4\\'3\". I hear echoes from the depths of hell, grabbing at my ankles to drag me down to the demons that i have upset in my past life. My walls scream at me as I beam ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the top of oil rig. I hear footsteps when i sleep and the explosions of rockets haunt my nightmares. every therapist and doctor ive seen has tried to lock me into a psych ward, but you are not allowed to bring in electronics, so there is no way to see if I am being raided and I will miss at least three force wipes (months for normies) which is completely unacceptable. I fear now more than ever that my sins will catch up to me, and I will live a life down bad and #PrimLocked in the darkest pit of the universe with nothing but the rust theme song repeating in my ears over and over and over and over again. 5/10 its worth it if you get it at sale.',\n",

It's one of those games I keep going back to after short breaks away from it. I've met some fantastic people in the game and I've also met some not so great people, but it all depends on the type of servers you play on. This game is not suitable for children, so if you're a parent reading this, don't buy it for your child.\\n\\nIf a story-rich, quest based game is what you're looking for, Rust isn't the game for you. Try the Fallout series. Rust is a dystopian, multiplayer survival game without a clear story. The story isn't written anywhere but you can kind of gather the history of the island from playing it over time. \\n\\nWhile Rust is categorized as a PvP game, that isn't always the case. Over the past few years that I've owned and played Rust, I've learned that PvP is only one of the many server types that Rust offers. Sure, the Facepunch Official servers are all PvP but the privately run, community servers offer so much more. I'm a casual player myself so I prefer to play on PvE servers. Servers where the whole raiding and killing other players isn't possible and the true survival part of the game shines through. If PvP and/or PvE servers aren't your thing, there's also roleplay servers and minigame servers. Roleplay servers offer the ability for you to play the role of a fictional character and minigame servers have a ton of games for you to play within Rust. No matter your play style, Rust has some aspect of the game that everyone can enjoy.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve been a fan of Dead Space since before the first title even came out.  I was instantly intrigued by the early trailers and even ended up in the top 10 finalists of the No Known Survivors contest and won a free copy of the game.  I\\'ve counted myself as one of Dead Space\\'s biggest fans ever since and replay the original and Dead Space 2 regularly.\\n\\nFast-forward to now and we have this absolutely stellar remake of the first game.  I have to admit I came into this cautiously optimistic because it would have been easy to miss the mark when remaking a game as legendary as the original Dead Space.  Not to mention the well-known fact that EA botched Dead Space 3 by meddling in its development (injecting microtransactions, coop, and story changes) and set absolutely absurd sales targets which lead to the ruination of Visceral Games.  Knowing that this franchise was still in EA\\'s hands and being developed by an entirely different team was concerning to say the least.  \\n\\nWell.. my concerns are history.  They knocked it out of the park!  Having finished the game at this point I can say that this game stands beside the Resident Evil 2 remake at the absolute pinnacle of video game remakes.  The main and side stories of the game were expanded upon without being drastically altered which serves only to improve them.  Isaac and Nicole\\'s relationship is much more interesting for example, and we get further backstory on characters (and even monsters) that were more of a mystery in the original.  Parts of the original that could get a bit tedious (like the ADS defense segment) were polished and made more enjoyable.  The upgrade tree for weapons is very similar and yet enhanced with new unique special upgrades that make things more interesting.  Additionally the two main companion characters (Hammond and Daniels) are much more interesting and likable in the remake.  I absolutely loved the addition of optional side quests which expand on the story.  This is a clever way to add more lore for those of us that are interested without forcing it on those who are not.  \\n\\nI have to say one of my favorite changes with this remake is the fact that instead of being a chapter-based setup locked behind the tram, this version of the Ishimura is completely open and you can take the tram anywhere and anytime you want.  With the new security clearance system this strongly encourages backtracking when you unlock access to new areas.  I was also very happy to see that the game clearly indicates the \"point of no return\" where you might want to wrap up any side quests before finishing the main story.\\n\\nAll in all, I was absolutely blown away by this remake and I am incredibly hopeful that they will continue with a Dead Space 2 remake of this caliber.  Here\\'s to hoping that Dead Space is finally back!',\n",

       "  'review': \"EA Motive's Dead Space Remake is phenomenal. This remake adds extra side missions, stunning visual enhancements, and impressive sound design, providing a true current-gen experience while the core gameplay stays true to the original game. It's a mix of nostalgia and freshness that targets both OG fans and new players. The game provides a jaw-dropping cinematic experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat until it ends. It gave me goosebumps from time to time; it's a next-level immersion. The overall feel of the game is fantastic and it is very well polished at launch, which is very rare these days, so that's a plus. if you're looking forward to purchasing it ? Just don't think much about it; simply purchase the game and enjoy the spine-chilling experience that Dead Space Remake has to offer !!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dead Space(2008) was one of my all time favorite games I ever played back on my Xbox 360. To see it remade is amazing feeling, one that I certainly didn't expect. For myself-and I imagine for everyone who played the Original- It's like coming home after a long time away. More importantly, it lets new players and perhaps even old ones who missed out, enter the wonderfully crafted world of The USG Ishimura. In a sense, remaking a game after all this time for young and old alike to share in. Makes us whole.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dead Space is a classic of the survival horror shooter style games set in a sci-fi universe. Not having played the original, so I will talk about the game itself and not the remake part.\\n\\nThe game will put you on board the USG Ishimura, a surface breaker ship that goes dark after arriving on a distant planet. When you arrive on board, you'll discover different monsters that you'll have to face to survive.\\n\\nWe feel a slight inspiration of resident evil in the gameplay but with many unique and innovative elements. There is an exploration side with a lot of loot to find allowing you to improve your armor and the different weapons you find during your adventure. You will also find different gagdets adding a real dimension to the gameplay. There are also puzzles, some of which will force you to face monsters while solving them which makes these passages terrifying, I hope you are not afraid of the dark...\\n\\nThe game is also very immersive, the audio design is really insane and makes you very paranoid. One of the best things about it is that all of the game's hud are directly embedded in the game, so there is no pause time when you are on your map or in your inventory, you see what your character sees.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique survival horror, as mentioned above, the gameplay is quite rich and innovative, the atmosphere is insane. This game really stands out from its genre and is a must have for any fan of this category.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m amazed by how well they manage to pull this off. It\\'s like the RE1 remake of Dead Space.\\n\\nFirst of all, the game is close to flawless on release, a staggering difference compared to other recent releases. Some people have complained about missing mission objects but I haven\\'t experienced any of that and I tend to break games. There is some stutter when entering rooms. While i hope they can iron it out in time It\\'s nothing close to Stutter Ring or the Stutter Protocol. Shaders are precompiled so that shouldn\\'t be the issue this time around.\\n\\nAll gameplay changes are for the better IMO. You move more like DS2, making you feel more in control. This might remove some of the tension like removing tank controls in RE but I always felt DS1 was a bit sluggish. They have also mitigated that loss of tension with the new \"director\" that can throw encounters at you when you don\\'t expect it. The backtracking and sidemissions add a lot of enjoyment and the world feels a bit more \"alive\". It\\'s just the perfect incapsulation of what it set out to be, RE4 in space (no, you still can\\'t roundhouse kick the necromorphs. you\\'re pretty much an engineer in an old school diving suit).\\n\\nModels have obviously gotten a lot better and some people don\\'t like seeing the wrinkles on Nicole (who is probably the same age as Isaac, 40s) and she is actually pretty if you stop being childish for a moment. You\\'re entitled to your opinion but having a 40yo engineer and a 20yo, well educated and experienced, doctor doesn\\'t make any sense (the people running defence also show their colors saying \"not everyone can look like model\", but she could literally still be a model with her face but she might be a bit short for that vocation). The raytracing also does wonders to the characters faces so turn that on if you can.\\n\\nSome of the story changes are great and add to the atmosphere while others seem silly, they tried to add a bit more depth to a specific character and it fell flat for me. I did play the original and if you didn\\'t you might not feel the same way, the idea itself is somewhat clever.\\n\\nThe same can be said about some other changes you\\'ve probably heard about, they don\\'t necessarily feel natural especially the bathroom one. I just don\\'t see why they would have three figures instead of just the one with halfpants/halfskirt, or just a sign saying bathroom since there are no gendered bathrooms on the ship from what i understand. It feels contrived and unrealistic which might take away from immersion for some people.\\n\\nI\\'ve played through the game once, on NG+ now and still having a lot of fun with the mechanics. Cutting limbs off of necromorphs with an engineers tools somehow never gets old (unlike Nicole amirite huehue).\\n\\nAmazing utilization of Raytracing, my stock settings had it turned off and turning it on was like night and day. I haven\\'t seen many games where it\\'s this prominent.\\n\\nAtmosphere is great with a lot of background noise keeping you on edge, weapons are fun and somewhat diverse (I mostly use the plasma cutter, and the flame thrower for those small creepy crawlies though), upgrade system is enjoyable and pushes you to play ng+ in a good way, the addition of keycards and backtracking gives a lot to the hoarder in me and ofcourse Isaacs iconic suits are just *chefs kiss*.\\n\\nI recommend this with all my heart and will now go and buy the bonus stuff just to show the developers that i love what they\\'re doing and hope to see more in the future.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Awesome remake of the cult classic sci-fi horror game (Dead Space) from 2008. The graphics looks very good and detailed and the sound effects in this game is outstanding. Very creepy to explore the big space ship (USG Ishimura) as a disaster on board the ship has happened. You have several great weapons to handle and upgrade in this alien outbreak. Great monster design and it feels like the cult horror movie (The Thing) from 1982 or the remake of that same movie from 2011. Very disturbing feeling.\\n\\nI played the game on my dated (2016-2017) PC: (Asus, GTX 1070 -GPU, 6700k -CPU, 32GB -RAM, SSD install, Windows 10, ASUS 24\" 144hz monitor @ 1080p)\\n\\n** I played with LOW setting @ 1080p resolution getting 30-50 fps. The game requires a much newer machine to bump up the graphic goodies. \\n\\nGreat work by (EA Motive). This game is an instant buy. I envy you guys who never played (Dead Space) before. This is the version to get no mather the cost..\\n_________\\nScore: 9 of 10',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played all 3 mainline Dead Space games and I can say without hesitation this is the gold standard for any sort of remake. Not only has the graphical fidelity been brought up to modern standards, but many weapons have been tweaked or refined to be much more useful in combating the Necromorph threat. The cherry on top of this layer-cake of gaming goodness is the return of Isaac Clarke's talented voice actor Gunner Wright, who has joined us on our return to the Ishimura to breathe new life into the story by giving a voice to our armor-plated favorite engineer. A must-have for anyone who enjoyed the previous games or enjoys tense survival/action.\",\n",

(I will not apologize for that pun)\\n\\nI'm only within the first 2 hours of this remake though and words really cannot describe the feeling i have, it's like reliving my teen years.\\nThe graphics is gorgeous and the optimization is good on my end at least, i would say this is how most of us remembered DS with the nostalgia glasses on.\\n\\nThe biggest improvement might be the gameplay, combat is so much more fluid while also retaining the feel of the original. \\nThe sound design is also top notch, and the best part for me personally that is: Isaac is voiced now and they brought back Gunner Wright which is a huge pro.\\n(Also most of the original cast is also back, but they were always voiced characters)\\n\\nTo those who never played the original: I envy you guys, you are about to experience one of the greatest survival horror games with a modern coating it deserves.\\n\\nFrom a long time Dead Space fan, thank you for the devs who clearly had passion towards the first game and even EA for reviving this long dead franchise and giving\\nit a shot again. \\n\\nI hope this one sells well and we might get a Dead Space 2 remake too down the line, or even a long overdue sequel to DS3. \\nThis team proven that the IP is in good hands with them.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I love the OG Dead Space so much and hoped I could love the Remake just as much, if not even more, but sadly this isn't the case. The technical state of the game is simply atrocious and the true horror experience I currently have. My RIG is well above the recommended specs (i7-10700KF, RTX3080, 32GB Ram, NVMe SSD) and the game still runs like a turd.\\n\\n- constant smaller frame drops for no reason\\n- DLSS and FSR are both borked (VRS setting you can't turn off which results in muddy/blurry textures)\\n- buggy ragdoll/collision physics (enemies can get stuck easily in tighter spots)\\n\\nAnd I could even live with those problems if it wouldn't be for the major problem I currently have: \\n\\n- after returning to the Kellion - if the game runs for ~5 minutes - cutscenes trigger a bug which locks my FPS around 10-20 regardless of the settings I have until I restart the game making it simply unplayable for me. tabbing out and back in may help some others but it doesn't for me\\n\\nI simply can't recommend the game in its current state. The gameplay and atmosphere are both still great so if the devs fix those problems I will obviously change my review. Until then, it will remain negative.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Intro[/h1]\\nEven after completing the remake, I still think Dead Space (2008) doesn’t need a remake, as the technology and design of the original are so advanced and future-proof that it is more like a game from 2015. That being said, the remake is a welcome addition – it extends and enhances the original experience, and as a fan, I love seeing the long-waiting return of a dormant franchise.\\n\\n[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]\\nThe atmosphere building is a staple of the franchise, inspiring lots of later horror games. With the smart use of light, shadow, darkness, creepy environmental noise, unsettling background music, claustrophobic environments and jump scare, the OG excels at creating psychological horror – players are so stressed about their surroundings for anything that might come out. The remake not only recreates this essence of the original, with updated visuals and technology, it also makes it better thanks to higher fidelity. For example, due to technology limits, the OG doesn’t have great flicking light effects or completely dark areas, which the later DS2 shows their existence can take the horror atmosphere to another level. The remake makes up for them while looking very good (the OG looks brown like many games at that period).\\n\\nAn issue I have with DS3 and the latter part of DS2 is enemy encounter becomes so frequent that there is no chance of building up atmosphere. The unsettling feelings are gone because players are just busy shooting enemies nonstop, effectively making the game an action shooter. I am glad the dev realized it - or because the OG doesn’t have this problem so it wasn’t inherited by the remake. Anyway, the remake has a good encounter frequency – there is room to build up tension while players won’t feel bored for not having encounter for too long. \\n\\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\\nFor returned players, I think the level design is an even more meaningful change than graphics. I am very happy to revisit familiar levels and iconic locations, as most (or all) levels were retained and rearranged (with new levels added) while undergoing a modern spin to add more playability, such as adding side quests, more zero gravity and vacuum areas and locked rooms can only visit in later process etc. My favorite is the new circuit breaker where players must turn one or another switch on/off, like kill the oxygen or the light. This “pick your poison” mechanic is very brilliant as players must live through the consequences they choose, adding a new layer of stress.\\n\\nThe OG level design is good but suffers from being too linear – levels are divided too distinctively by basically starting from getting off the train and ending in getting on it, making the game kind of predictable. In the remake, levels transit more seamlessly and there is no longer getting on the train and goodbye, as Ishimura is now an open map that players need to traverse back and forth for the story and exploration. \\n\\nI like the idea of exploration, but it is not done good enough. As the story progresses, players acquire different levels of clearance for locked rooms and locked boxes, and a big part of exploration comes from back-tracking to open them. However, because the map system follows the original, it is not good for displaying the multi-layer and more complex map of the remake (OG doesn’t even need to use map). The locator was supposed to be a good solution to this, but for whatever reason, you cannot customize waypoint to the locator. Players are forced to use the map making it a cumbersome experience to explore. \\n\\nOn top of that, the exploration is too dispensable for not being rewarding enough. The most valuable rewards are weapon parts, which unlock more weapon upgrades. But they are not get-and-use, you still need to spend nodes to upgrade, making them much less appealing, not to mention even without them weapons are pretty powerful already even at hard difficulty. The worst part is that side quests (except one) only tell more story background and give some consumables along the way, which come plenty anyway.\\n\\nFor the rest, it is a shame that the game doesn’t improve the control in zero gravity areas as it is still as clumsy and disoriented as before. In these areas, combat is kind of cumbersome as well, since they are often not bright enough but have enemies coming from any direction. \\n\\n[h1]Balance[/h1]\\nWeapon, enemy, inventory all went through rebalancing to overcome some drawbacks of the original. I beat the game at hard difficulty and noticed enemies are slower than OG so that there is enough time for me to rotate over weapons to perform tactics, opening up more possibility for strategy, like I managed to shoot out fire wall with flamethrower to keep enemies in place, cut the limbs off from tougher enemies with plasma cutter and finally blast the rest of them off with contact beam, all of which were done without stasis.\\n\\nEven at hard difficulty, the game is kind of easy, but enemies are definitely more spongy than my liking, which is done for not only strategy but also for balancing supply and weapon. In the old games, I always bring plasma cutter, line gun, pulse rifle because they are good for all circumstances. But in the remake, they receive less ammo drop than they consume (un-upgraded) at hard difficulty. An un-upgraded plasma cutter kills enemy in 8 to 12 shots while it only drops 6 shots for once, so in the first half of my game, my cutter and rifle often had no ammo. Also, if you keep four weapons in inventory, these three tend to get less or no chance of ammo drop. I think it is to balance out them being too powerful (force rifle feels nerfed in actual use), opening more chances for other weapons. I honestly like this change as otherwise I wouldn’t discover the flamethrower has the highest kill-to-ammo consumption ratio among all weapons.\\n\\nOne small problem with trajectory and collision is that sometimes grenades and explosives just go through enemies without hitting them, but it doesn’t affect that much.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nNot much was added to the already abundant space Lovecraftian world setting, and the story changes focus on new characters and some original characters having altered fate and stance, paving the way for sequels. One of the biggest issues I have with the original is the protagonist is a silent tool man, displaying no thoughts and emotion whatsoever and just doing what was asked. In the remake, he is given a proper backstory and character development so that the audience can finally sympathize with him and understand his motive and thoughts that were not clearly told before.\\n\\nIn the original, most storytelling is by conversations while you are busy exploring or even fighting, leading to a hard time focusing on the story. The remake gives proper conversation windows (you aren’t too busy with something else) while keeping it succinct so that the storytelling feels better.\\n\\nAs for the downsides, there are some cringy dialogues, and I don’t think the story goes as naturally as the original. “Make us whole again” is a very memorable line in the original and is presented in very powerful moments, but the remake sort of spams this line everywhere losing its charm and impact. The remake does have a better reunion scene between Isaac and Nicole, with the game suddenly changing from fast to slow and having smooth music amidst the tension, but I still think the original story was presented better and has better writing.\\n\\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\\nI like the OG slightly better in terms of story, and its level design does have its charms. Because the OG is not really outdated, I won’t call the remake a replacement of the original, but rather a new way to experience the classic with a better atmosphere, adjusted balance and modernized level design. It is excellent even with a few minor flaws. I hope EA keeps remaking Dead Space in this style, but surely DS3 will need a big overhaul.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The USG Kellion receives a distress signal from the USG Ishimura, where Isaac Clarke’s girlfriend Nicole is stationed, is how your roughly 12-hour nightmare starts. You don your RIG and reload your plasma cutter as Captain Hammond calls everyone on deck on approach of the massive flagship. Floating in space, the planet cracker thrones over everything surrounding it, a dark grey shape that seems so vast on the outside and so crammed on the inside, truly a monster of steel and glass.\\n\\nInside its dark and filthy guts, almost the entire crew has either been killed or transformed into Necromorphs, twisted, reanimated bodies that want nothing more than to kill you in one of very many, very violent ways. As the infection took everyone by storm, they left behind half-interrupted lives, notes and half-completed jobs, the web of which you will explore through notes, videos and audio logs.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927376329\\n\\nThis entire aesthetic, heavily inspired from early entries into the Alien franchise and heavily reliant on a type of dim, sort of candle-light lighting eerily revealing metallic, industrial textures is so memorable that a well-done remake of Dead Space would not only introduce its engaging world to newcomers and younger generations, but would also reignite interest in the rich extended universe this franchise has to offer (two novels, a bunch of spin-off video games and sequels, a comic book miniseries, two feature animation films, two graphic novels paint a detailed mosaic of the origins of Unitology and the Markers).  \\n\\nWhat is a game made with love? It seems strange to use the term when referring to a video game featuring, but not limited to: body horror, dismemberment, jump scares galore and oceans of blood, but Motive’s remake of 2008’s Dead Space is, without a doubt, a game made with plenty of this ingredient. The devs have a fundamental understanding of everything that worked before and made little clever changes that elevate the already solid structure of an inspired video-game into an even richer experience. For example, power reroutes will have you decide whether you want to traverse a dangerous section without light or oxygen, and the linear tram-based navigation now permits you to revisit any unlocked section of the ship before a point of no return that takes place before the last chapter. The levels have extremely similar layouts to the original but are arranged in a very intuitive way that makes backtracking for sidequests and optional locker rooms very simple and straightforward.\\n\\nOpen spaces are much more interesting than in the original, in no small part because there’s no more zip-based navigation. Wide, crowded hangars now invite you to boost yourself around and loot everything, and there’s even a bossfight in Zero G that makes full use of the free range of movement while floating. Sidequests develop backstories for some of the secondary characters and monsters, and credential-dependant lockboxes can only be opened after the appropriate-level RIG is looted.\\n\\nThe graphics are absolutely spectacular, offering plenty of vistas and eye candy worthy of modern GPUs. The game really shows its strength in the dark, where subtle changes, fog and particles create a deeply unsettling atmosphere and where you can truly feel Isaac’s fear. It’s a pity, however, that the game doesn’t use modern ray-tracing capabilities to show Isaac’s reflection in mirrors, which could really enhance his growing insanity under the Marker’s influence. Speaking of Isaac, he’s no longer the Gordon Freemanesque mute in the original, having an entire personality and a much angrier attitude towards Unitologists. There are some other minor changes, gender flips and race swaps and more heroic and dramatic deaths, but the ensemble has the same players and follows the same patterns.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927375738\\n\\nDead Space’s sound design also deserves special mention, not only because of the unsettling score, layered noises and clean blending of themes, but especially because of the convincing way sound behaves in a vacuum and the spatial design that enables you to quickly assess all dangers.\\n\\n \\tWhile retaining the spirit, narrative beats and most mechanics of the original, 2023’s Dead Space manages to improve upon numerous aspects and provide a clean, streamlined and well-optimized thrill ride out of the box. Its iconic and immersive game design sports the same diegetic UI, and the weapons and mechanics are for the most part the same as they were fifteen years ago, with a few different alternate fires and improved Zero G navigation, similar to the one in Dead Space 2.\\n\\n\\tAs in any other game in this franchise, limb-chopping will be your bread and butter when it comes to dispatching the monstrous Necromorphs, with an updated system that allows peeling, where you weaken limbs but do not cut through them. I feel the remake is more demanding in terms of precision and angles, where accuracy will save you a ton of ammo and weapons are more evenly balanced. \\n\\n\\tYou spend credits to buy medpacks, ammo and suit upgrades (with the addition of weapon upgrades that unlock greyed out nodes in the bench tree), and one of the most satisfying progression feelings as your suit gradually becomes more elaborate and advanced. The Contact Beam and Force Gun were my two favourite weapons in terms of punchiness, but the numerous upgrades, special passives given by unlockable upgrade slots and a fistful of Nodes will turn any gun into a powerhouse. Stasis and Kinesis remain priceless in the array of gauntlet events, ambushes and bossfights you will have to traverse.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927376148\\n\\n\\tYou can get most collectibles and upgrades within a single playthrough, but if you’re wondering about replayability features there’s the obligatory New Game+ (and the final suit can only be purchased on your second run) and if you’re feeling particularly ironman-y there’s Impossible mode, where you only get one save slot, a single life and the option to continue on Hard difficulty if you die. Beating the game on its hardest difficulty unlocks not only a special skin but also the Foam Finger thing from Dead Space 2. There’s even an alternate ending you can only see if you find all the Marker fragments hidden in New Game Plus runs, so there’s more than one reason to complete Dead Space more than once.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhether you’re a fan of the original or simply a survivor horror enthusiast who never got around to checking this franchise out, Dead Space (2023) can be worthy of your time, provided you aren't deterred by the expensive entry price.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'TL;DR Some improvements in the gameplay department, make it feel like a \"modern game\" however, steps back in the atmosphere department which overall makes the original a better experience. \\n\\nNo this isn\\'t a negative review focusing on the optimization issues. No this isn\\'t a negative review on Denuvo, this is negative review of the remake. I\\'ve seen a lot of positive reviews praising how this game is a better experience in every way to the original, though I don\\'t concur with that statement. Of course graphically, it is better in every way, and there are some game play improvements. I\\'d like to add that in preparation for this remake, I\\'ve played the original just a week before release and thus I think the comparisons I make below are fair considering I have both games fresh in memory.\\n\\nOf the top of my head, I like the new node system (in which it locks you out of future node slots initially). Furthermore, finding weapons instead of buying them has better encouraged me to use other weapons besides just sticking with the plasma cutter. This in conjunction with the game giving more varied ammo, forces you to use more varied guns. Zero Gravity gameplay is also changed to DS2 mechanics, which is for the better. Another improvement that I can think of is the power management system, which in some sections makes you choose cutting out power or air, which add some variety. Furthermore, the removal of loading times making it one seamless experience, and lastly the AI director for spawning enemies. Regarding enemies themselves, in the original, enemies would essentially stagger everytime they were shot, in the remake, enemies dont stagger pretty much at all, which makes things much more intense as you have less time to before they come at you. Overall there are some minor improvements which can make the game play more enjoyable. \\n\\nWhile there are more improvements that I have not listed, those are the ones I can think of the top of my head, of which most are in the graphical and game play department. Where the most of the negative aspect of this review comes down to main reason why everyone loves dead space, the atmosphere. The remake is significantly reduced in this department. While there\\'s no denying you are stuck on a spaceship alone in the middle of nowhere, the remake is almost worse in every aspect and not that close to the original in regards to making a survival horror experience. What I\\'ll list below are very slight changes that may seem insignificant, but on aggregate, really take away from the atmosphere.\\nStory - For one, while the remake does include more background story, it kills the mystery of what is going on in the ishimura, the VERY FIRST data board you read mentions the untiology and paints them in a bad picture right away, and soon enough you learn about the marker. While this information was fed at about the same rate as the original, in the original, we we\\'re left wondering what the unitology was and where these aliens came from, etc, compared this to the remake which gives way too much info too early. \\nMusic - Another big change is the inclusion music in some sections where it doesn\\'t need to be. Of the top of my head, when flying in space in zero-g they\\'ve added some background music which slightly reminds you are just playing a game. The original had no music, and all you could hear was the muffled sounds of footsteps and isaac\\'s breathing/choking as he started to run out of air. I\\'ve also noticed this music addition in some sections without zero-g, where I think switching the music with more atmospheric diegetic sounds would fair better.\\nSound - Honestly, the sound is great in most parts, as they just took the one from the original, but some areas such as the head banging scene and the introduction scene to the baby necromorphs were much more visceral in the original, the original was more powerful sounding, while in the latter, the terror in the guys voice was much more present.\\nAnimation - Again, animation so far is overall better, or the same. Yet a minor detail is isaac\\'s movement, in the original, his movement and stance were visually much more careful and tense whereas remake is less. This extend to running as well, in zero-g, running looked more hefty and had more weight to it, which really drives home the idea that you are this one man against the elements of space in this bulky hard to maneuver piece of equipment.\\nOverall Direction? - I guess the main point i\\'m coming down here is that the game feels like its pandering more to you the player which once again detracts it from reaching that realistic atmosphere the original achieved so well. It feels like a present day dramatized piece of media, whereas the original feels like a more realistic representation of what would happen and while it still panders to the player, the remake does so more. I\\'m quickly reminded of the intro where you get this gore filled stabbing of your crew mate all the while being shoved onto the window, compared  the original where its just him being stabbed. Another example being  or the cinematic introduction of the necromoorph that transforms dead bodies instead of watching it helplessly. \\n\\n(Spoiler ahead regarding one scene)\\nOr how about when Doctor Mercy puts stasis on you, I loved the idea and thought it really added to the experience, however the stasis actually freezes you, which would contradict that our stasis merely slows down things. It also just so happens you are in stasis for the right amount of time Dr. Mercer can monologue and leave. Wouldn\\'t it have been great if perhaps they could make you move while in stasis, and mercer takes your gun and walks around so you cant do anything but slowly chase after him. \\n(Spoiler end) \\n\\nOverall, the modernization makes it feel less unique... less dead space? I\\'m not sure what to call it, but if you play both games, I\\'m almost certain the original Dead Space will feel much more like a unique game rather than the remake which feels like a modern title.\\n\\nPerhaps i\\'m too harsh on the game, given that I\\'m making a lot of nitpicks. Overtime, as I put more runs into the game, my perspective may change. Though the game is a well done re-imagining, and certainly, if this game were released today as a new IP, I would love it more. However, the original does exist and there\\'s a reason its one of the greatest games of all time, which is why I nitpick. My point of contention focuses on the survival horror experience, which does not stand on par to the original Dead Space.\\n\\nReview was updated to fix typos and flow* and added the Spoiler example',\n",

       "  'review': \"As of February 5, 2023, I cannot recommend buying this game on PC-- this is subject to change pending the devs fixing the widespread framerate drops/stuttering issues that seem to plague the title. \\n\\nIN GENERAL: The game is phenomenal across both my Steam Deck and my desktop. It's a straight upgrade over the original, taking everything good about the OG Dead Space and improving it. \\n\\nHOWEVER: whether it be related to the invasive Denuvo DRM that EA has deemed this title to be saddled with, or some texture streaming issue, this game has serious frame drop and traversal stutter problems. In certain segments, my desktop rig (a 3070/9600k build) drops from just over 80fps at 4K down to lower than 30 fps (as low as 10, as I've recorded). These low framerates will continue even into menus. This is a widely reported issue that has yet to be fixed, and does not occur on console versions of the game.\\n\\nThe drops have outright ruined entire setpieces, made combat frustratingly difficult, and come at unexpected times. You can be moving along at 120fps in a complex environment with plenty of particle effects and lighting details, only to have a low-detail room tank the game down to 20fps. The drops and stuttering also occur on the Steam Deck, but are less severe (it's less noticeable to go from 45fps down to 25 than it is from 120 to 30).\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Another solid remake to add to the collection. Pretty faithful to the original while bringing graphics, controls, and compatibility up to modern standards. No Origin/EA launchers, no MTX so far - just some \"Deluxe Edition\" skins. (Fine as long as there\\'s no nagging for purchases in-game.)\\n\\nOnly major concern right now is performance, as the game basically requires DLSS or FSR to get anything playable. I would have expected much higher FPS considering how small and segmented most areas are. Some minor bugs and QoL concerns. PC controls are well mapped by default and supports multiple binds. There are some menus (store, inventory) that require the use of the keyboard (Q, E, space, arrow keys) to navigate, even when the player is immobile and should be able to use the mouse instead. Ultrawide is supported at launch (finally!) Steam deck is supported, but performance is not what I would call \"playable\" (minute long stutters, can\\'t hold 40fps, muddy visuals).\\n\\nI would consider this the definitive edition for anyone who hasn\\'t played the original, and I\\'d consider it a worthwhile upgrade for those who have.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I see a lot of people online praising the Remake so much and some people even saying how it does everything better than the original. I think the remake is mediocre, especially for an AAA title.\\n\\nThe animations look wonky. Some people like me were complaining about it before the game got released. They didn't manage to fix them and suddenly everyone doesn't care that they look straight up ridiculous? The moving, the stomp, the punching animations, etc. I managed to avoid being grabbed by necros in my first playthrough so I watched some of the death animations on YouTube. The moment Isaac gets grabbed the camera suddenly changes. It's really bad, I have no idea how people can praise this so much. In the original when you had to to face the drag tentacle, you could move freely while it pops up before it finally grabs you by the ankle. In the remake, your character completely stops and waits to get grabbed. It feels a bit disrespectful as the original creator of the game said that it was a huge issue for them but they managed to nail it. The remake devs just avoided the problem entirely.\\n\\nVoice acting is better in the original than in the remake. I like the original characters way better too. I didn't like how they also changed some of the story and added unskippable cutscenes that take controls of your character so you're forced to sit and watch. The cutscenes also hinder replayability greatly. That part where Isaac's with Johnston or Hammond and before he can move he slowly stays still in one spot and removes his helmet from his head, making you walk slowly, unable to sprint or do anything until the dialogue finishes, only for Isaac to slowly put it back up 30 seconds later? Yeah, that too.\\n\\nThe game also has some performance issues reported by many people on good gaming rigs like constant stuttering and input delay. I have an RTX 3070. While I did manage to play on 140ish (it can go way lower on some parts) FPS at 1080P, I did experience constant stuttering as well as input delay on the weapons. I also crashed thanks to a forced patch while I was half way through playing on Impossible without saving once, so when I booted up I started from the very beginning without any weapons. I kept playing a day later, this timesaving from time to time. Managed to get an infinite loading screen 2 times randomly so I had to forcefully close the game and revert a bit.\\n\\nThe combat loop is better than the original and you can no longer stun lock necros with your weapons, however they screwed up the kinesis. They are times where I wanted to pick up objects right infront of me and the game for some reason would not let me. That includes the dead necromorhph's blades or stasis/explosive canisters. I would try to grab them, but I would get some other object instead way off where I aimed or I would get some necro body I killed earlier. Also the fact that no one can really run this game at really high fps like +200 or 300, making aiming a bit sloppy. I've played FPS games semi competitively and playing on lower fps I can really feel the difference in the mouse feel. I'm not sure how to explain it properly but I feel like people who've also play FPS especially on low sensitivity would understand. Though it's not really a thing that the devs can do much besides optimizing the game better as the graphics are good. Maybe soon we'll get an overpriced GPU that can run games like this on +200 fps on low. Who knows.\\n\\nIt's an alright game but the original does everything besides graphics way better. If you're gonna get it, I suggest you wait for a sale. Also don't get the DLC. The suits are straight up just reskins that do nothing. I only equipped them once to see them.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]NOT TRASH.[/h1]\\n\\nIn [b]Dead Space[/b], you are Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent on a repair mission to USG Ishimura, a gigantic spaceship that also seems to have lost contact with the rest of their mission. But you quickly realise this will not be your regular run-of-the-mill task as you discover that the entire vessel seems deserted, bodies have risen with blades for arms, they’re spewing acid, want you dead, and oh, the church is also involved?\\n\\n[table]\\n[tr]\\n[th]🟩 Pros[/th]\\n[th]🟥 Cons[/th][/tr]\\n[td]\\nAmbience\\nIt will make you anxious\\nSatisfying encounters\\n[/td]\\n[td]Some mechanics did not age too well.[/td][/table]\\n\\n[h1] is Dead Space a good remake?[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Dead Space[/b] is a third-person shooter horror game with gloomy corners, little to no lights, and metallic hallways that could potentially hide a monster at every step. The atmosphere is frightening, and your only mean of survival is to dismember your enemies.\\n\\nWe can also start by praising the development team for what seems to be an impossible feat lately. A game was released and was functional and optimised adequately on Day 1. Throughout my gameplay (so far), I never encountered a single frame drop or a loading screen. The transition in action is seamless.\\n\\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics have been refreshed and are adding a whole new spin on Dead Space; the Telekinesis and Stasis are getting some significant improvement and proper tools in your arsenal; you are not confined to one way of playing the game, even though nothing will separate me from my plasma cutter. Each gun is enjoyable to handle and provides a unique way to use it, depending on the situation. The difficulty levels are significant in HARD and above and seem just enough for Normal. The completionists will have a solid task ahead to complete the game without dying once. Finally, maybe it was the force of habit, but it took me a minute to remember that there is no dodge button, loyal to the original gameplay and reminding you that it has been 15 years. Furthermore, replayability is essential nowadays; Dead Space offer the possibility to play in New Game +. \\n\\nThe ambience is superb. Dead Space truly shines in the inclusion of modern graphics in the game, the metallic hallways, every dark corner, flickering lights, and the anxiety of an incoming jump scare. Every little detail has been used to put you in the universe of Isaac and make you feel like part of his adventure. The sound design is crucial in the game as it alerts you of enemies you haven't seen yet (looking at you child-monsters-on-walls); the engine noises, the random screams, sobs, and voices are developing more anxiety than having to host my wife's family over for the holidays. The music also goes along the situation; you forget it's here, but it switches between light tension, full-blown heart attack and deafening silence, which makes your heart race. Finally, different collectables offer tidbits of information, lore and audio logs; all add just enough to the general theme without being a chore to find or essential to the game.\\n\\nThe story did not change from the original, except that you are now part of it. Isaac Clarke has lines which contribute a lot more to the immersion. This is probably the weakest part of this remake as it remained untouched primarily, without being a negative in itself due to it staying loyal to the original content. The addition of different dialogues, lines and other elements was welcome.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924637819\\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\nIt is now time to answer the original question: [b]yes[/b]. I think this remake performs better than its predecessor in many aspects.\\n\\nDead Space stayed faithful to the original game of 15 years ago; purists should not feel concerned. Dead Space kept the same gameplay ideas and mechanics from then and improved on them a little bit. What sets this remake apart from the rest is that a whole new generation of players that can't build up on nostalgia will be able to explore the franchise in a modern setting. The graphical facelift is superb, on par with modern technology, and all the added extra details contribute significantly to the general ambience and atmosphere of the game.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924932920\\n\\n[h1] Let's connect [/h1]\\nIf you liked this review, you can check my curating page for other games you may like.\\n[quote]• [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33562948/]Curating Page[/url]\\n• [url=https://discord.gg/U5Katayh6v]You can also join the Discussion on the Trash Can Discord server [/url][/quote]\",\n",

EA Motive have shown nothing but passion, dedication and love to this remake by respecting the original source material and upgrading it by adding new material on top of it. The developer streams, no MTX's, just buy once and enjoy the experience! The game looks stunning visually and runs absolutely beautifully on my 3080 at Ultra settings, everything maxed.

I know the devs said that they were inspired by Capcom and it's RE2 but if you ask me, they took a lot of page from RE1 Remake when it comes to Lore.

I believe it would even be enough for some people to check out DS2 and even 3 after they finished playing the game.\\n\\nNO CUT CONTENT. This is a 100% faithful Remake in my opinion.\\n\\na solid 9/10.

       "  'review': \"[h1]Коротко о главном[/h1]\\n\\nЭто именно то, чего ожидаешь от крупных компаний, когда они делают одиночную, сюжетно ориентированную игру, а не вот эти вот новомодные и жутко популярные (нет) асинхронно-мультиплеерные др0чильни типа Division'а или GTA Online или вроде того.\\n\\nСюжет полностью повторяет оригинальную часть игры, но с небольшими изменениями в плане нарратива, некоторые вещи преподносятся в ином контексте/в иной ситуации, конкретно про Юнитологов рассказано больше, чем в оригинале.\\n\\nЛокации переработаны, расширили элементы бэктрекинга, теперь на начальных локациях больше всяких дверей и ящиков, требующих определенный уровень доступа, который будет расширятся походу игры, так что имеет смысл пробегаться по старым локациям если хочется за 1 заход получить максимальный профит.\\n\\nГрафона навалили от души, технологии дали дизайнерам возможность в игру света, текстурки сами по себе не очень высокого разрешения, но материалы настроены грамотно, так что если не лезть в экран с лупой, игра выглядит очень сносно и любой закоулок хоть на обои ставь.\\n\\nКроме этого игра богата и на фан-сервис. Есть мелкие отсылки, сюжетные тонкости, рофляные сеты, пистолет в виде перчатки одевающейся на руку которая вантапает практически все живое. Ну вот прям как в RE2 когда давали задержаться в игре подольше ввиду того что есть разного рода мелкий контент.\\n\\n[h1]Не обошлось без дёгтя в бочке с мёдом[/h1]\\n\\n[i]Небольшая ремарка. Следует понимать что это ремейк/ремастер, называйте как хотите, оригинала из 2008 года, где уже все было придумано людьми, которые умели делать игры, интересные игры, с уникальным сеттингом, граммотно сочетать различные фишки. Улучшить что-то - много мозгов не надо, а вот сделать с нуля - тут уже не каждый может. Напоминаю что те же Hangar 13 сделали на 146% провальную Mafia 3, но так же сделали успешный ремейк Mafia 1. Я очень сомневаюсь, что у разработчиков получилось бы годное продолжение или новая IP[/i]\\n\\nПоговорим и о минусах тоже.\\n\\n• Графика и оптимизация: \\nВ игре применен Z-буффер в половину разрешения, так что screen-space шейдеры артефачат в 1080p. Не сказать что это большая проблема, скорее сделано с учетом 4к-экранов, где данных больше, плотность пикселей больше, и эти артефакты уже не так лезут в экран, но тем не менее. Казалось бы, есть FSR/DLSS, включаешь 4к + DLSS и пошло поехало, но не тут-то было. Что FSR что DLSS выглядят в игре абсолютно одинаково, вот абсолютно. Сравнение face-to-face отличить просто невозможно. При этом в обоих случаях убивается детализация текстур. Как это возможно? А вот все дело как раз в обрезанном Z-буфере, причем даже 4к не спасает, игра под DLSS в 4к выглядит хуже чем 1080p без DLSS. А еще игра умудряется статтерить каждый раз, когда прогружает очередной чанк уровня. И это с SSD то. Похоже что статтеры это бич игр 2023 года, что ни запустишь всё везде статтерит. И нет, дело не в моём риге, там все настроено и выпердоленно пуще некуда и на сколько позволяет железо. Не могу сказать что это прям большая проблема, с учетом темпа игры, но подбешивать может. По части графической оптимизации игра чуть выше среднего уровня. Да, фпс достаточно высок, но если фпс высокий, это еще не означает хорошую оптимизацию. Уровни в игре кишкообразные, открытого мира тут нет, рисовать дальше 10 метров не приходится, и очевидно что у игры есть Occlusion Culling (не рендерит то, чего не видно в кадре), при этом же еще можно заметить, особенно в больших комнатах, как прогружаются тени и объекты, и на RTX 3080 без DLSS в 1080p на ультрах без RTAO, игра выдает в районе 110 фпс прыгая в диапазоне от 85 до 150. Я бы не сказал что это хороший фпс при имеющихся условиях. Треугольников на экране не так много, дроу-колов тоже, игра на глазах грузит объекты, так что вместо 110 фпс должно быть 200-300, чтобы сказать что тут прекрасная оптимизация. Тот же RDR2 в открытых пространствах выдает почти тот же фрейм-рейт. RE2 на 1070 при тех же вводных данных что и у Dead Space (2023) вываливала на экран такой же фпс, только GPU был в 3 раза слабее. Ну в общем, оптимизация нормальная, если можно так выразиться, видели мы и хуже, но и стремиться есть куда. Если коротко то скажу что она лучше, чем в большинстве подобных проектов.\\n\\n• Звук и баланс: \\nЗвуки хорошие, не пожатые сэимплы, как в играх Sony, но не могу сказать что игра может похвастаться каким-то 3D-аудио, реверберацией, трассировкой звука [i](кстати тут она бы была п**дец как к месту)[/i], или высоким динамическим диапазоном. Звук здесь не более чем стандартный, ничего выдающегося, есть поддержка Dolby Access. \\nОднако и тут есть пара нюансов: уровни жестко поделены на секции, иногда можно услышать звук какой-нибудь хлопающей двери чуть ли не по всей локации, но стоит выйти за дверь соседней локации, которая еще открыта, как звук тут же пропадает - недоработка движка. Еще я скажу что музыка, которая проигрывается при виде каждого слабого или рядового моба который даже не стал для тебя скримером, в виде крипового оркестрового звучания в мажорных тонах неистово льётся тебе в уши, абсолютно каждый раз, заставляя чувствовать себя некомфортно, терять ориентацию, паниковать, мешает слушать подкрадывающихся сзади других врагов, и в целом раздражает. Быть может так и задумано, но я не вижу в этом никакого прикола, это просто бездарная работа, на мой взгляд, и так делать нельзя. Благо громкость музыки можно снизить или вообще вырубить. Забавно, что все вышеописанные проблемы по звуку, на прочь отсутствуют в ремейке Resident Evil 2, и там работа со звуком проделана на 2 головы выше.\\n\\n• Общие баги: \\nНа момент написания обзора, мной был замечено несколько багов/недочетов, которые скорее всего вытекают из движка игры, вкупе с их ИИ, которым они хвалились, который якобы высчитывает нервозность игрока и делает ему подставы. Был баг со звуком, забагался какой-то скрипучий семпл, похожий на белый шум с овердрайвом, и проигрывался до тех пор, пока я не перезагрузил сейв, при этом было не понятно это так задумано или что, он при этом перебивал музыку (её вообще не было в файтах). Несколько раз встречал баги с амбиентом в помещениях, проигрывался семпл какого-то стука в комнате, который не должен был и которого там не было ранее, при этом пропадали выходя за дверь комнаты, комната метр на метр, а за ее пределами есть несколько уровней корридоров, и этот звук был исключительно в этой комнате - что это было я так и не понял [i](как говорится не баг а фича)[/i]. Так же, при очередном перезаходе в игру, в одной из комнат образовался туман, которго там не было ранее, который просто пропадал если выйти за дверь, и смотреть на открытую дверь и отходить назад. Пару раз игра вылетала [i](просто закрывалась)[/i] без каких-либо ошибок в логах винды или диалоговых окон.\\n\\nВспоминая ремарку выше, оценить этот продукт можно с двух сторон:\\n\\nDS (2008) не существовало, и в таком случае, данный продукт можно рассматривать к покупке за полную цену. Она сочетает в себе элементы RE 2, имеет уникальный сеттинг, сюжет, современную графику, и в целом прикопаться особо не к чему, особенно если опираться на релизы других студий, который не имеют даже этого, а все то что имеют реализовано более скудно. И с такой точки зрения игра 8/10, могла бы получить 8.5/10 если б не имела багов, и лучшую проработку звука.\\n\\nDS (2008) существовал, а DS (2023) это глобальный мод, и в таком случае я не могу рекомендовать к покупке данный продукт за полную стоимость. Как минимум можно подождать патчей, доработок, скидок, а если еще и брать во внимание что это продукт - попытка навариться на чужих наработках 2008 года, и сделать себе репутацию за чужой счет, то только за 1500-2000 рублей и то 10 раз подумать, плюсы хоть и превалируют над минусами, но сами смотрите.\\n\\nИ вот как оценивать данный продукт - не понятно. Хочется похвалить разработчиков за хорошую игру и проделанную работу, но зная что это всего-лишь ремейк, и по факту игра вообще не ими сделана, да еще и косячки есть, я, к сожалению, не могу сказать что они этого заслуживают в полной мере.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'First, My playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steam.\\nI am a rank 100 and play all the factions.  I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.\\n\\nIt is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.\\nAfter so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin\\'s enemy.\\n\\nThere are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:\\n\\n1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).\\nNow the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)\\n\\n2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.\\n\\n3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.\\nBut I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.\\n\\n\\nThere are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. \\n\\nBut i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. \\nWarthunder \"can\"  become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.',\n",

       "  'developer_response': \"1. Yes, that is important part of good gameplay - the ability to find game quick enough.  But we are avoiding 'impossible to kill vehicle' - so basically you can meet more powerful vehicle than yours but there is a way to kill it anyway.\\n\\n2. All this is misinformation.\\n'There is no cheats' was never stated at all. This is part of phrase, switched out of context, from 2013, when there were ONLY TWO game modes - Plane Arcade Battles and Plane Realistic Battles (bot modes are planes only and with markers - so there is no maphack). And full statement was something like 'there is no such cheats in the game like speedhack or invulnerability or kill-all'. \\nMoreoever - those days there were no (at least known!) _working_ cheats at all!\\nALL so-called cheats were those days just malware. And the statement was perfectly clear and correct.\\nThis statement IS CORRECT even nowdays, but with tank battles (especially realistc battles) there are possibility to have maphack or aimbot.\\nWhen RB tank battles appeared WE IMMEDIATELY started work on anticheat solutions, cause hiding marks on tanks in client of course can be bypassed by cheaters - 'nevert trust client' is basics of multiplayer code.\\nAbout 'banning youtuber' - that is also incorrect. That was bad story, when one of our former employees overreact on one youtuber behavior (while youtuber was viloiting public agreement and EULA, btw). The problem was solved and videos restored in 4 days (youtube guys are slow and couldnt make it faster, while we ask them the same day). We apologize for that and perform some more actions and in a good relationship with that youtuber for long time since that.\\nThere issue has nothing in common with cheaters.\\n3. MOST of our work is fixing bugs and working on community reports and feedback.\\nHowever most of players do not understand that there are LOTS of players with DIFFERENT feedback. We have implemented features of years of manwork (for example so called LastManStading) by users suggestions and than remove them from the game by users feedback. Of course, there were different users - those who suggest and those who protest.\\nUser often think that his playstyle and feedback is common and all agree with it, but thats really not that often true.\\nWe have 15th game modes that can be treated as different games (tanks, planes, ship, realistica, arcade, simulator, and moreover - jets, bombers, fighters, assault planes, tank destroyers, tanks, rocket tanks, ATGM tanks and so on - there are really different) and players usually do not play even 25% of the whole game and do not see all the game and all other players feedback and opinions.\\nThis - game variety (and I'm not talking of content even! But we have hundreds of locations and thousands of vehicles that also matters) - can be treated as a biggest game flaw, and, in the same time, as a biggest game advantage and feature - this is the game where you can fight on almost any military vehicle against almost any possible comparable military vehicle in thousands of environments and situations.\\nI know, looking at amount of time you play the game, that you know and feel at least big part of the game, but almost sure that not all - there are not lots of players that experienced in all game aspects.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Okay listen.\\n\\nI\\'ve got 2,222 hours in this game while I\\'m writing this. I get that it\\'s confusing that I\\'m making a negative review.\\n\\nTl;dr: This is a good game, but one of the worst, most scummy products I\\'ve ever seen. One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of ways.\\n\\nAll I really need to do is explain the monetization tbh:\\n\\n-Silver Lions: Silver lions are the non-premium currency for War Thunder. They are achieved passively just by played, and playing well gives a nice bonus. Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ie, if you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you\\'ll get a small amount of silver lions, but even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amount, and to a degree this gets better the better you play). But here\\'s the... well... \"but\". Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the game, no matter what (ie, whether you are completely free to play, just have a premium vehicle, or have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too. Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repair, as do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them). You might be seeing the problem already, but if not stick with me here. As you progress through the game, if you\\'re free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive ones, then things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive. To be clear, all of this so far isn\\'t a big deal. The issue comes when you reach about 7.0 (battle rating, which is basically just a \"level\" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 8.0 for air forces, in my experience. At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive. Buying them, training a crew slot to play them, and every modification all costs SL, but also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle. At the lower tiers you might not even notice this. By about 6.0 you\\'ll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won\\'t be a major issue. You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehicle, but other than that you\\'re fine. But beyond that, certain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarily, though there\\'s always a long winded explanation that boils down to \"balance\") cost bafflingly, ridiculously, hilariously high amounts of silver lions. If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiers, you\\'re golden. You can lose some of it if you have some rough matches, but you\\'ll be fine. At the higher tiers, you could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky. Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it\\'s so expensive you either can\\'t buy it, or can but then can\\'t play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amounts. \\n\\nSo the question is... why? Why is there vehicles in the game that you are punished for playing? Why is the game designed in such a way that you can progress by grinding for hundreds of hours only to be rewarded by being literally unable to play if you have some rough matches? Well, it sorta brings us to the next monetization, but basically, you can buy Silver lions for real money. If you run out you can pay for more. Now full transparency, this isn\\'t technically pay-to-play. It\\'s more like \"pay-to-easily-play-high-tier\". You\\'re not locked out of playing the game, but if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don\\'t have silver lions, you\\'re out of luck unless you have amazing matches. Certain vehicles, like the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair cost, and such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless. Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs. It\\'s awful.\\n\\nSo, next up is Golden Eagles. This is the premium currency. This is nothing new, every F2P game has them pretty much. It\\'s not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle. They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the game, as well as silver lions, premium account time, decals, decorations, ect. Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime. I don\\'t know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot. Still, some are better than others. They\\'re objectively not pay to win, but they are clearly pay to progress. The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it. The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress. It\\'s not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well. But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grind, yes, but you also skip the learning. This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tier, who often teamkill, ram, block, capture-point steal, and otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase. To be clear I\\'m not strictly against this but there\\'s already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do. Again, fine, but it\\'s two clashing playstyles that shouldn\\'t ever really meet. Jets and main battle tanks should, in theory, have the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map design, mechanics and this aforementioned premium issue, they actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiers, and devolve into head-on ramming and head on charges.\\n\\nPremium accounts. Not much to say here. Again, normal for F2P games, but on top of everything above, and everything below, it\\'s a lot. They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions. You progress faster and run out of lions slower. It effects other players in no way, since even if you have a premium account, unless you buy a high tier premium, by the time you get to high tier you\\'ll likely be fairly experienced.\\n\\nConvertible Research. One of the scummiest. Basically you can pay Golden Eagles (real money) to speed up or skip the research of a vehicle. This one just purely prays on frustrated people not thinking clearly who are fed up with the grind. And this game is full to the brim with grind. It is literally endless grind. You will never achieve everything without paying huge sums of real money, but the game loves to tempt you with the fact it\\'s technically possible (until they add the next thing, and they add new vehicles every update more or less). Never, ever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don\\'t feel like doing. Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account). This is a waste of money. Do not use your eagles on this. \\n\\nGaijincoin and the War Thunder Market. Think of the CS:GO or Dota or TF2 marketplaces. It\\'s just that. Turn your money into even faker money which you can\\'t turn back into \"real\" money. There\\'s skins and non-premium but exclusive vehicles on the marketplace. Almost all are event vehicles that required immense grind to get. A few of them are outright overpowered, like the KV-220, and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it\\'s not the worst thing ever. You can get some of this stuff for free easily. Again, this isn\\'t on its own that big of a deal, but keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* game.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a battlepass (Like Dota, Overwatch, Smite ect.).\\n\\nBasically: Every element of this game is designed to squeeze money out of you.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin\\'s head office.\\n\\nLet me list the most frustrating aspects of this game:\\nA bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you\\'re signing up for. Also the first serious review I\\'ve done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it\\'s about time I told (warned) people about it.\\n\\nThe devs:\\nHas never listened to it\\'s community\\'s suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said \"no\" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn\\'t figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. \\n\\nThe grind:\\ndear god the insane grind, if you don\\'t get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won\\'t see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation.\\n\\nNew vehicles:\\nAnytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the \"op vehicles.\" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don\\'t address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. \\n\\nThe maps:\\nOnly 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless \"unintended\" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that\\'s right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there\\'s 1 2 or 3. Yup that\\'s all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin\\'s inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT\\'s... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but \"are accurate to a real life location.\"\\n\\nHelicopters:\\nTwo words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won\\'t cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you\\'re in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don\\'t even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you\\'re forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli\\'s. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I\\'m grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I\\'m not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there\\'s 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli\\'s. \\n\\nAir realistic battles: \\nhave 1 single game mode variant and it hasn\\'t changed at all since it\\'s introduction to the game back in 2011. It\\'s fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn\\'t really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they\\'re ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can\\'t respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing.\\n\\n\\nIt reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. \\n\\nGame modes: \\n\\nRealistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren\\'t enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don\\'t even have any for certain BR\\'s (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again.\\n\\nI wish I could have my 2000 hours and countless dollars back.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Allow me to preface this by saying I have been playing this game for years and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game. Whether on premium currency, buying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time. At the time of writing this review I have 240ish days left of Premium time left.\\n\\nI started playing just before they released Ground Forces. The game started out very fun and engaging, but now 1500 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into. They turned a fun game, albeit with a heavy dose of grinding, into one of the least fun games I have played in a long time.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. It looks great when maxed out graphically.\\n2. The variety of vehicles is amazing. (caveat about this later). There are manyt different nations to play as.\\n3. Netcode, while not the best I've seen, is very passable for a Free to Play title, with only minor hiccups throughout my time.\\n4. Bugs and glitches, they definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about them.\\n5. Cross play with either Xbox or PS4, but not with both simultaneously.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Economy, whether for Silver Lions (SL) to purchase things you've unlocked, or Research Points (RP) to actually unlock them, is a slog. It has been only getting worse as time goes by. It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicle(topping out at just shy of 400 thousand RP), let alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle (upwards of 2 million) and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle (2-3 hundred thousand). Keeping in mind, without paying for premium account, you may only get 500-1500 RP and 10-20 thousand SL per match, which can take anywhere from 5-35 minutes.\\n\\n2. Premium currency is very expensive, and some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currency, Golden Eagles(GE). There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying it, as I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over time, but I did not use them myself. There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 1:1 with USD, which is used in the marketplace they created.\\n\\n3. The Marketplace. I hate it. Vehicles sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars, it completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced. It's just like CS:GO skins, only its not just skins. Imagine if you had to buy the AK-47 in CS:GO for $700 before you could use it.\\n\\n4. The balancing is probably the worst offender in the reason for this review. Gaijin has shown over the years that they do not intend to balance the game, going so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them. Standard M.O. for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nations, wait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for players, do it again. It is never a level playing field for every nation. One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nation, every patch. I'm tired of it and its not fun.\\n\\n\\nI could absolutely write more about the game, but I really don't want to give it any more time. Can you have fun with this game? Yeah, sure, but you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great too.\\n\\nFinal Rating:\\n\\nJust watch a Youtube WW2 documentary / 10\",\n",

When your vehicle is damaged or outright destroyed, you will be charged a fee that is paid for with silver lions--the virtual currency you use to purchase vehicles and upgrades. The amount you pay will depend on a number of factors such as how upgraded your vehicle is or the type of vehicle it is itself. The issue is how nonsensical these costs are and how Gaijin determine them. Gaijin claims the costs are for balancing, which is not only misleading, but lying to the entire community.  It is about profit, nothing more. Silver lions can be purchased with real money and the amount awarded after each match can be so little, or even negative, that players are enticed to spend money just to afford the new vehicle they spend hours grinding for. Players can lose up to 50,000 silver lions per match if they don\\'t perform well, and that isn\\'t always the fault of skill; it is a lot of the time down to poor game design. We will get to that soon.\\n\\nNow let\\'s discuss the effect the hostile microtransaction system has on gameplay, because it is horrendous. A massive percentage of players are terrified of dying and then paying excessive repair costs for that vehicle. In ground battles, I recall many instances where 90% of my team would be encamped upon a hill and remain there for the entire match because they didn\\'t want to take the risk of moving across the open field just to get destroyed without getting any score and then incurring the wrath of repair costs. My playstyle can best be described as an aggressive brawler, so when I decide to push and battle over the objective, I will be doing so with only one or two teammates--sometimes none. Gaijin punishes players for losing but at the same time punishes players for taking risks, which seriously hampers gameplay. Players no longer work as a team, they only care about themselves and how many silver lions they will make in a battle.\\n\\nAnother huge flaw with this game is the map design. This is primarily an issue with ground battles for obvious reasons. Gaijin have chosen the \"form over function\" route where you make a pretty map first and work out where everything will go later. These maps are so broken and flawed to the point where your entire team can be spawn camped from the other side of the map. The battle then becomes so one sided due to players, again, not wanting to risk spawning anything to avoid having to pay for the repair costs of dying five seconds in. This causes a spiral effect where teams will rarely make a comeback, as half of the players in said team have understandably returned to the hangar to avoid those repair costs. The newest ground map, Red Desert, has made a lot of good design decisions, primarily with a mostly symmetrical layout. It still isn\\'t perfect, however. Fortunately, you can ban maps from your matchmaking. You\\'ll be paying Gaijin money to do that, of course.\\n\\n\\nOne of the issues with the game\\'s development is the community itself. There are two vocal minorities; the die-hard \"This game is perfect!\" apologists and the \"Frak you, Gaijin!\" toxic man-babies. The apologists appear to be in complete denial regarding any issue that players start discussing, I assume due to the amount of money they have spent on the game, which is an amazing case of Stockholm Syndrome. On the other side, you have the toxic man-babies who just want something to be mad about. An example of this would be a recent update where Gaijin actually lowered the insane repair costs for some vehicles, but these people reacted so negatively to seeing \"economic changes\" without knowing what actually changed, that their outrage seems to have panicked the developers into reverting those changes very quickly.\\n\\nGaijin has demonstrated very little respect for it\\'s community and have done the complete opposite of what creative director Kirill Yudintsev stated in 2014:\\n\"Players happiness about the game (not about us [Gaijin]) is our main prioirty[sic]. We are making changes in the game since its official release based ONLY on players feedback or ideas how[sic] to make game better for them.\"\\n\\nThe only reason War Thunder is popular and successful is because it is unique. There is currently no other competitor that offers a similar experience of realism and variety in vehicles and gameplay. Once a similar game is created and not looked at like a bag of money by those developers, where do you think players will go? Gaijin is out of touch with not only their own game, but their community too. It\\'s an incredible game ruined by greed.\\n\\nI have been playing War Thunder since 2014 and have spent more money on it than I would like to admit. I have never been vocal about the game, nor do I rarely ever leave reviews, but they really are going too far.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Oh boy, War Thunder. After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral review, but as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative one.\\n\\nThe game itself is fun. It's free, so try for yourself. The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind. e.g. Tier V+. The grind has been getting worse and worse, especially without a premium account and vehicles. Not only in research, but also in purchase and running costs. \\nGaijin attempts to balance things by increasing repair costs, which does not really change the balance, but just makes it impossible to play certain vehicles, such as Bombers, for prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit. As a 100% free player, if the unlocking of vehicles doesn't bring you to a halt, then making enough money to actually play them will do the trick. \\n\\nIt's quite a shame because under all the grinding and money sinks, War Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction. Not into a Pay 2 Win, but in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matches.\\n\\nThe worst offender in recent years though, has been the Gaijin market. What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplace, the gaijin market moved away from a community content driven store, where players could sell their vehicle camos and profit, to a more intrusive model, selling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possible. \\n\\nI only want the best for the game, hell, in my over 3000 hours I spent at least 200-300€ on the game and without regret. It is free so whoever is interested should definetly give it a go and check it out, but if you expect to play it entirely for free, you will be in for a long grind with little reward.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"War Thunder is one of those games where you really, REALLY want to love it, but the game does everything in it's power to make you absolutely hate it.\\n\\nThis game has one of the most intricate combat systems ever put into a vehicle-based game, a massive roster of lovingly detailed military vehicles recreated with as much care and accuracy as possible, across land, sea and air and pretty decent graphics and effects that help bring the intensity of the clashes between war machines to life.\\n\\nHowever, War Thunder also has terrible monetization, featuring premium account time, paid currency, premium vehicles, loot boxes and a player marketplace based on, but separated from, the Steam one. The game suffers from poor balancing when it comes to it's vehicles, an awful New Player Experience, tons of powerful or simply unique vehicles being only obtainable at certain points in time or during certain events, locking them out from the majority of the playerbase to an even greater degree than premium vehicles, an economy designed to ensure players will lose money through vehicle repair costs, constant power creep through new updates adding more higher-tier vehicles, absolutely horrible grind that requires months of play to reach the higher tiers and that has not been balanced to account for all the new vehicles added with even higher costs, shoddy matchmaking that sees nothing wrong with pitting a team of newbies against one of highly experienced players and then punishing the newbies for their loss, limited gamemode options with the only PVE option being a lazy horde defense mode and a half-baked anti-ragequitting system that ends up punishing players for accidental suicides or causes outside of their control, such as lost connections and crashes.\\n\\nIf you are just an average joe, looking for a fun game to spend some time with, don't bother with this. Unless you are a fan of military vehicles this game will not appeal to you. If you are a fan of those, then you might be able to tolerate the game's awfulness just for it's subject matter. Try it for a few days and, if it doesn't click, drop it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'As a player who\\'s been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire (released September 2020) I\\'m proud and disappointed at the same time of this game.\\n\\nWhen I first started playing, my dreams weren\\'t focused on the F-4E or MiG-21 variants. I stuck to the US tech tree, and the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD-3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me. I wasn\\'t trying to go grind for top tier jets, I just wanted to have fun with what I had.\\n\\nNew Power came (November 2020) and I think that\\'s where this game started to go downhill. New premium jets were being added alongside standard jets, and, as time went on, I started to change my mindset to grind for jets. That\\'s where my problems begin.\\n\\nI can applaud the developers for modeling every single aircraft, but i\\'m not happy because of the grind. Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year - if they were lucky.\\n\\nNow, you may be wondering \"why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it?\" \"what went wrong?\" \\n\\nI gave it a thumbs up because it has the potential to be one of the best combat games out there. Thousands of vehicles, a nice community (no-one really complains about losing or anything or ranting about (X) jet from my experience) the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemic, and more.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s the current problems with War Thunder.\\n1 - The grind is almost unbearable if you have a F2P (Free 2 Play) account\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to grind the US tree with standard planes alone, but that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehicles/bonuses/time.\\n\\n\\n2 - The system is designed to pressure you into spending cash\\n\\nAlthough this is classified as a \"con\", the true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game. Because of this, they have to make packs/vehicles/premium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive. Without cash, they can\\'t manage the servers. Without servers, they can\\'t manage the game because the servers can\\'t be used. Without managing the game, War Thunder will slowly die.\\n\\n\\n3 - Vehicles in Rank IV or V and onward tend to have extremely high repair costs, crew trains, research requirements, and high purchase costs\\n\\nIf you managed to grind a rank V vehicle, you still have to play games in order to get enough currency (Silver Lions) for the vehicle purchase. If you have enough, you still have to deal with a Crew Train (doesn\\'t cost as much as purchase) though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lions.\\n\\n\\n4 - The game needs to decompress\\n\\nIf you never played the game before and don\\'t know what I mean by this, tanks and aircraft have this system called \"Battle Rating\". They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best. Currently, the game has stopped at Battle Rating 10.7 for tanks and aircraft (ships at 6.0/6.3). \\n\\nHowever, the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraft, and, if they don\\'t decompress soon, players may have to deal with F-15s (if they ever get added), F-16s, Su-25s, etc as a F-100 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 10.7 game. F-100s were made in the \\'50s. \\nThey could face aircraft made decades after them \\n(all the vehicles mentioned in this portion of the review were made in the 70\\'s except for the F-100)\\n\\n\\n5 - The team needs to advertise their game better\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what I mean, almost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a top-tier tank, plane, or helicopter (top-tier in the community means modern-day vehicles or similar). \\nSo imagine someone seeing these ads, saying \"oh what a cool M1 Abrams! i can\\'t wait to download and play with it!\" and then downloading the game and realizing that instead of a M1 Abrams, they get a M3 Stuart, a World War 2 era vehicle. \\nThey then see a M1 in the US tech tree, but come to the realization that they will have to go through hours of struggling, grinding, getting enough currency for the vehicle, only to finally get a M1 Abrams that they will have to use at one of the most dreaded battle ratings of the game.\\n\\n\\nIf the game developers fixed some of the issues here, that would improve the quality of their game by a lot. War Thunder has the true potential of being one of the best combat games out there, but the developers don\\'t seem to be trying to fix the current issues, which, if fixed, could have the game be a lot better and live up to it\\'s old status of being one of the best combat games.\\n\\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what goes on within. \\nIf you want to stick to \\'low tier\\',  where it\\'s mostly fun (no grind, no high repair costs, etc) you can, and if you want to play this game for the sole purpose of having fun with early World War Two tanks, planes, or ships, this game would be great for you.\\n\\nThat\\'s all I have to say for now about this game.\\n\\nUpdate (5/21/2021):\\nWith Update 2.7 (Red Skies) introduced via trailers and videos from content creators (it\\'s not out just yet), I have taken a look at the dev server streams and saw that they have fixed quite a few things. Thus, I may do a revised review of the game, though not until the game updates to Update 2.7, because we can\\'t judge books by their cover.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[i]Please read before making consideration:[/i]\\n\\nI am friends with a former Senior Mod from the War Thunder forums. According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right. \\n\\nIf you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.\\n\\nAll that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer. \\n\\nThanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).\\n\\nUpdate: Took a few years off, giving it another shot. Same game mostly, just more monetization.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"extremely frustrating, time consuming and at times even money requiring.\\n\\nThat's how most of the playerbase would describe the game and you can't blame them. It's a terrible game in terms of balance/economy when you get involved in the meta/endgame part. Starting with non existant battle rating decompression leading to unbalanced matches ending with millions of copypasted vehicles in different research trees to make them look fresh and new.\\n\\nTo give someone a better perspective, I've been playing this game since the beta off-steam and this is my review.\\n\\nTiers I-III are relatively easy to grind out, play and enjoy. For all the countries in the game, this  is about 100 hours of solid fun and time to improve at the game, learn the basics and figure out how to fly certain aircraft types, what ammo to use, how to position yourself in a tank, how to climb in realistic battles, how to range your cannon, how to use certain ammo types etc. \\nFor a new player, yes, this is a good source of fun and enjoyment and a must-try for any military fans out there.\\n\\nBut everything above is pain, unlocking modifications for high tier tanks/aircraft to make them competetive and in some cases even viable takes way more and more time and in-game money. RP required and money requirements for new vehicles skyrocket and to top it off, matches get significantly more sweaty with every battle rating increase after you reach tier IV thanks to the absurd amounts of in-game money required for certain vehicles to repair - literally forcing players to actively kill steal / play the risk&reward game - and for someone who is flying their brand new tier IV plane/stock tier IV tank - suffering. \\n\\nThere's a ton of ways to ease off the grind but most of them involve payment through your credit card and others take way too much time to be considered entertaining and this is single handedly the worst part of War Thunder.\\n\\nGive it a try and don't spend your money on it. If you find serious interest, consider getting a premium vehicle/account/talisman and carry on to become a sweaty, salty war thunder redditor and go downvote this review.\\n\\nand just in case someone asks for the ships - yeah, I forgot about them. so did gaijin.\\n\\nedit #1; Lightning is still at 9.7 \\n             helicopters are pay to play\",\n",

       "  'review': 'There should be a support group for players of this game.  I\\'ve heard it said that War Thunder is the game you\\'re almost allowed to have fun with and it\\'s 100% true.  The frustration and emotional damage wrought by War Thunder is a war crime in itself.  You get just enough non-BS matches to keep you hooked while Gaijin panders to select groups just to milk more money from them.\\n\\nEvery vehicle you research just brings you further up the frustration ladder and it doesn\\'t get better until you reach near the top.  Until then?  Well, prepare your hind quarters for an almighty violation.  Unlock a WW2 era tank?  That\\'s ok, you\\'ll be facing Cold War era gear.  Your mighty 1942 heavy tank will be strapped down over and over again by HEAT-FS rounds not developed for 10 years.  Got yourself a brand new, shiny jet?  Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll be fighting other planes outfitted with guided air to air missiles.\\n\\nTo make it even better, you\\'re required to either pay lions (the in game currency) or wait to repair your vehicle.  The costs of those repairs are *supposedly* based on the effectiveness of the vehicle but there are patterns evident that rule that out.  For instance, planes with no guided munitions will cost more than a plane just a step above it that can erase you from existance with nothing more than an afterthought.  But that plane a step above will be half the price.\\n\\nThe game mechanics that sounded so cool when you first read about them?  Just another avenue of frustration.  Volumetric rounds, for instance, are great until they\\'re not.  Theoretically, the rounds have an actual volume, instead of just being the exact pixel you aimed at.  Actually, it\\'s not even that, the exact pixel that Gaijin\\'s screwed up mechanics decided that the round actually went.  That round has volume, but only most of the time.  Sometimes, rounds that should have bounced off due to the armor (if they were truly volumetric) just magically go right through.  \\n\\nWhen you\\'re not dealing with that, you\\'ll be dealing with magic glass that eats every bit of a tank round or pilots being \"knocked out\" with a frequency that defies logic.  Probably 90% of my deaths in a plane are because the pilot was knocked out.  Doesn\\'t matter what kind of maneuvers you\\'re doing or the range you\\'re at.  Gaijin decides the moment that round is fired whether it hits and nothing you do matters in that.  \\n\\nAnd don\\'t even start on the crew levels.  Until you\\'ve nearly maxed them out (a process that *requires* real money, FYI), they\\'re near useless.  Want to turn?  Hope you\\'ve coughed up for the Golden Eagles (currency paid for with real money) to skill them up, otherwise, they\\'ll black out almost instantly.  It gets worse too.  Haven\\'t maxed out that tank crew yet?  Hope you like being killed by invisible tanks hiding behind what amounts to a stick because your crew\\'s spotting skill wasn\\'t high enough.  \\n\\nEvery once in a while though, you\\'ll have a good match.  One where you get paired up with vehicles that are near enough to your own to make it fun and when the almighty RNG-esus smiles upon you, granting your vehicles some semblance of normal performace.  It\\'s just enough to keep you playing but it\\'ll destroy your sanity in the process.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better. If you do that, this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't in good faith recommend this game. The foundation is solid. The historical accuracy, the plane/tank models, the damage model, are all there, great and very realistic. But all of it is ruined by the economy and questionable developer/balance/gameplay choices.\\n\\nThe progress in unlocking and researching new vehicles is very quick and satisfying in rank 1. But by the middle/end of rank 2 of any nation progress will become increasingly slower, and the cost to buy the already researched vehicles grows more and more, so much so that you can barely afford anything at some point. Almost everything costs silver lions, one of the MANY currencies in game, even the ammunition for each vehicle, and if you don't have a premium account, and at a certain point even if you have one, the mission rewards won't be enough to let you play at higher ranks continuously. It's bad, and it ruins the whole experience. \\n\\nThe worst thing is that, when your vehicle gets damaged in a mission, you'll have to pay silver lions to repair it, OR wait several hours or days for it to repair for free. While in the first few ranks the cost is acceptable as you get rewarded way more than that for each mission, as you unlock more expensive vehicles the repair cost will be too much to be sustainable. Which means you'll probably have to wait up to days to play with that same vehicle again.\\n\\nThis creates a vicious psychological cycle. You don't want to be destroyed in a mission or get your vehicle damaged as when that happens you'll most likely become very frustrated.\\n\\nThe more you advance through the vehicle ranks, the more skill and knowledge is also required. Which is kind of fine, if the game was sustained by a fair economic system and didn't have questionable balance and gameplay designs.\\n\\nI have mostly played with air forces throughout my many hours in game. While the arcade game mode feels pretty balanced, the realistic mode is not. I'll make an example about gameplay and balance design choices that I dislike.\\n\\nIn the last few days I was going through rank 2 of the american air force. There's this airplane, the P-51: when you spawn as a fighter in a realistic battle you will have to take off from an airfield, both factions do. The P-51 has one of the worst climb rate in the game in its rank as a fighter. And it's a boom and zoom plane, which means the plane is required to be at a high altitude and have enough energy/speed to be effective. Since both factions airfields are very close to each other, with that plane you won't be able to climb high enough to have the effectiveness that the plane requires. Even if you side climb, the plane will lose effectiveness once you reach 4000 metres of altitude and beyond due to its engine limitation. And by that time the game is probably already decided, meaning you've spent 10-15 minutes climbing without engaging in any fight whatsoever.\\n\\nI have tried to play the plane differently, using it as a low altitude boom and zoomer, or as a turn fighter. If you play as the former, any other plane which has the altitude advantage over you will gun you down, and there will be. If you play as the latter, every fighter will outperform you and kill you, as the plane turn rate is very bad compared to other fighters. Once an enemy fighter has you in its sight, it's game over. This happened over and over again, as frustration mounted I felt helpless, the plane was basically unplayable. Its only usefulness, then, was to use it as a bomber killer, as at least its guns are formidable: but since most bombers at rank 2-3 will stay at a altitude higher than 4000 metres, getting to them will be hard and still take quite some time\\n\\nThis is just one of a few examples I could make. Bombers effectiveness is also questionable at best, as most fighters will gun you down at some point during a match. That is more a question of when, not if.\\n\\nThe game also has several single player modes that you could play. Some are free, dynamic campaigns is one them, some are not, the Pacific campaigns, which, from what I've read, they were last updated so long ago that some missions have become unplayable over time, as patches have changed the game and the specifics of each plane.\\nI like dynamic campaigns though: but again, Gaijin doesn't care about them. Some missions are almost impossible to win. They also have a daily limit, which means the rewards get scaled so much after you've completed a couple that you won't be able to get any research points nor silver lions by completing them. Developers want you to play online, not some unfinished single player mode they don't care about.\\n\\nDo yourself a favour and don't play this game. You may get sucked into it, because as I said the foundations are all good and there, but over time you will realize you're mostly getting frustration out of it and you're wasting your time as the economics is completely rigged and want you to spend money on every turn.\\n\\nI almost forgot to mention, after the war in Ukraine the developers decided to remove the chat, making coordination with teammates that much harder. It's been disabled for more than a month now and who knows when it will be back.\\nGo figure\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I started playing this game in 2013, and I've put 2,000+ hours into it. I guess I should give a review. \\n\\nDisclaimer. I am now permanently devoiced in game. When I started in 2013 I was a foulmouthed teenager, and over the course of these 7 years my game chat really didn't change too much. I just began pairing my decreasing opinion of the game with my inappropriate language. I rightfully bare the burden of my permanent devoice.I do not hold anything against the gamemasters or mods for their enforcement of gamechat policy.\\n\\nTo begin, Warthunder had the potential to be the best, most historically accurate and fun arcade style flight simulator/shooter on the market.... because it the only game of its caliber on the market. \\n\\nThe grind until you give up and buy a premium account pay2win currency system is great, but its not for me. I would have rather payed $60 from the start and had complete game. I reached top tier jets years ago, sometime around 2014-2015, and I found that jet combat was the most fun to me, and so I mainly played jets. Gaijin has again and again added a response to counter response of new jets that stomp the previous additions, all in hopes that you will get frustrated enough to buy the newest planes outright. Is it possible to play the game without a premium account or buying planes? Yes. Is it more frustrating without paying to win? Also yes. \\n\\nThe community is nothing but fun. The players all collectively hate our developer overlords for the fat cat money grabbing swindlers they really are.\\n\\nIts 2020. My life has changed, and Warthunder has too. But continuously facing suspiciously biased planes and weapons, while other factions face a significant disadvantage isn't right. You can't make a game focusing on the military marvels of each country, but make the competitive multiplayer a one sided and unbalanced fight without people feeling like they are facing a Russian bias from a Russian developer.\\n\\nEventually a new game will come along where the developers will actively listen to the community, make changes based on feedback and not in the name of pure profit. I will happily shell out my money when that game comes.\\n\\nUnfair balancing, blatant Russian biases and favoritism, and pay2win scheming developers aside, the content of the game is fantastic. There is nothing more satisfying than breaking the sound barrier a treetop level. Facing the skilled tactics equally as good or better pilots, using team tactics - the gameplay itself is wonderful and you should at least try it once. If you look too deep into the game you will eventually start to see the ugly underbelly. So don't look. \\n\\nI've set the cogs in motion to suspend and delete my account. I almost feel like its been an abusive relationship that I couldn't quit. I've deleted the game from my PC probably a dozen times, but I reinstall and get dragged right back in. I like this game, but I am not going to take the abuse from Gaijin anymore. \\n\\nGoodbye Warthunder. Its been one hell of a flight.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I quit this game months ago and it was the best decision I ever made. I am only choosing to review this game now because originally, I did not want it to come from a place of anger. After I quit War Thunder I bought myself a nice flight stick and throttle, downloaded a popular military flight sim and bought a few high-fidelity planes, and learned how to really fly a plane and it’s been a blast! \\n\\nNow that I have moved on and no longer harbor hate for War Thunder, I am going to tell you what can happen if you download this game. Now you might not have money to spend, or maybe you do but you are special, but chances are you are like most of us, you aren't special, you are average, and you work and you play games for fun when you are done working. If that is the case there is a good chance  you will end up like many of the countless players that are caught in this never-ending loop that Gaijin intends to keep you in, grinding every minute or dollar they can out of you until you finally break. If you are lucky this happens early on, if not it happens thousands of hours and dollars later. \\n\\nI  got out just shy of 800 hours and I'm thankful of that.  I am not sure if there are any other reviews like this on steam nor do I care which is why I turned off comments. I believe the truth is a huge percentage of people get burned by these types of games but few are willing to admit it publicly.  Any public discussion about this will have trolls and git gud comments, but the truth is you can't get good at a game that is rigged against you.\\n\\nThose of us with disposable income aren't generally stupid, we know that spending real dollars for pixels  is foolish but we also know what we earn in one hour working versus grinding hundreds of hours for one plane. Those that would rather pretend they are too smart to fall for this model, or that they have grinded every vehicle they own, while they secretly pay, are part of why companies like Gaijin make so much money. \\n\\nWhen you first start playing you are supposed to be blown away by the beauty of the planes and the freedom of flying around. You should be excited that you can point your mouse where you want your plane to go. Wow, the freedom and simplicity of flight! Your first few rounds will be amazing, you'll be killing planes left and right with a crappy WW1 Biplane that can turn on a dime. You probably won’t even realize you are fighting bots but it will be an absolute blast.\\n\\nAs you move up the tiers you will unlock more planes (or other vehicles) and probably get pretty hooked as your hard work is rewarded with exciting new vehicles.\\n\\nWow, a free-to-play game that’s so much fun and all these free vehicles?!!? Amazing right? WRONG. IT IS A TRAP. If you don't read any further just know that you must run, save your time, your money, who knows what else, your job, your relationships? JUST RUN. \\n\\nOK if you are still here let me explain. The game will start as a fun and rewarding experience so that you quickly become hooked. As you progress the grind becomes longer and harder and so does the game. If Gaijin gets its way and you have that kind of personality that many of us do, you will start playing the game every moment you’re not working. The harder it is the more driven you are to rise to the challenge! \\n\\nThe harder you work the higher you rank and your progress slows to the point that you feel compelled to maintain the forward momentum you had earlier so you sign up for a premium account because it will increase your leveling efficiency significantly. Eventually, that slows down too, but now you can’t even imagine not having a premium account.  \\n\\nNow you are in the higher tiers too so you’re getting killed left and right. You start feeling like you need to get good, and skill is the only issue. You think if you just practice enough and git gud you'll start killing everyone. \\n\\nBut no matter how much research or practice or tweaks you make the consistency just isn't there.  You will have some good rounds, sometimes even great rounds, once in a blue moon you might have 5 or 6 awesome matches in a row and you'll get your adrenaline rushes! But it won’t last, inexplicably you'll start to have terrible rounds eventually, no matter what, literally shooting planes and the bullets do nothing. Some will say it's lag even though you have an insanely fast connection, some will say you need to get better, change your gun sites, vehicle settings, or tweak your video settings to low to cheat (especially for tanks) but it's all just a scam. \\n\\nIt doesn't matter how much practice, or time you spend, or money, or what vehicle you use, the game is designed to trap you in an endless miserable loop of grinding, and paying, for small rewards, accepting unfair nerfs on your already unlocked vehicles and getting back to the grind for whatever the flavor of the week vehicle is next.\\n\\nThis loop will frustrate you after whatever combination of time/money you invested and you will think you need to take decisive action to get out of this loop now! Time to double down! You have invested way too much time; you need to start winning consistently, you deserve it! You need a better vehicle and to focus more and work harder to start winning consistently, right?? Time to push harder than ever now, oooohhh your so close to the next plane, you will kick ass consistently when you have that plane. Oh well you have the plane but you need the better engine, or the missiles unlocked, or the airframe upgrades. OH but the grind is SOOO long. Ok your just going to spend some premium currency to speed leveling stuff up because you need a better plane to compete. \\n\\nHmm you know what? These free planes are no good. You need to buy few nice premium vehicles because everyone around you is telling you that you need them, or you’re getting killed by them constantly, that must be the advantage, right? Ill buy this plane for 50 bucks. Oh I need a good tank, oh and a good AA vehicle. Oh I only have these for allied teams I need them for Axis too.\\n\\nJUST STOP.  The truth is that if a vehicle exists that will give you an advantage it will likely be nerfed right after Gaijin has determined enough people have spent money to unlock it whether it be with real money or premium currency. If you can grind it out and it is a great vehicle and you don’t spend money to acquire this vehicle by the time you finally earn it, it will likely be brutally nerfed. I believe the intention is so that the next time a new powerful vehicle arrives you will immediately pay to unlock it just so you can enjoy it before it gets nerfed. \\n\\nIf you start playing despite my warning in this review, there are only 2 ways this is going to end 1. You hate the game but can't stop because you have invested too much time, money, and given up so much in real life that you feel trapped. After all, quitting is admitting you are a jackass and now you must play until either you or the game dies.\\n\\n 2. You do what I did and just walk away and let it go because you were a jackass but that’s ok all you can do is learn from your mistakes or simply repeat them. \\n\\nIf you are caught in this loop, the best advice I can give you is to simply stop logging in and free yourself of the bullshit. \\n\\nIn closing, while I no longer harbor hate for them, I do believe the people that develop and run this game are truly evil.  Unfortunately, they are being rewarded for their greed and their disgusting tactics are encouraged by the very people they take advantage of. \\n\\nWhile I feel free to play has its place when executed without malice, pay to win must end. I think it is time for players with incomes to band together and start refusing to download pay to win games and bring about the much-needed death of an evil business model or the future of gaming will be a grim one.\",\n",

       "  'review': '\\tWar Thunder is an amazing game that revolutionizes many parts of the gaming industry, from small quality of life features such as tow cables to its massive scope from the interwar period to the modern day. However, this creates another problem: War Thunder is a monopoly of a game, and Gaijin, the company that develops the game, treats it as such.\\n\\tWar Thunder is the only game in existence that offers what it does, so if a player wants something that War Thunder gives, they have to go through War Thunder, a game which suffers from dozens of tiny cuts of annoyance that drive old players to leave, and Gaijin makes its money off of constant transplants of new players paying money to get some of the action themselves.\\n\\tGo to any prominent War Thunder YouTuber and they alone will have over a dozen videos detailing individual problems with the game, and how the whole community gives feedback on so many issues only to fall upon deaf ears, or at least ears that don’t seem to care for determining which is good feedback and which is malicious.\\n\\tAnything from the gameplay being unbalanced, to the grind involving over a year of dedicated work, to other small problems, contrasted with the ever-increasing number of late-game and premium vehicles that are increasingly unbalanced in the matchmaking algorithm and much harder to get in the first place, show Gaijin’s lack of genuine care for making the game one worth playing for fun.\\n\\tSince it is a free-to-play game, I don’t want to stop you from playing in the first place, but I beg you, do not pay any money. Support YouTubers and Twitch streamers and other content creators that bring up problems with the game, and see for yourself what War Thunder truly is. Not only for your sake, but for the sake of the whole War Thunder community, which continues to be supported by transplants of new players such as yourself as old players bleed from open wounds that Gaijin does not bandage.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Just to give you an insight of the company that runs this game, Gaijin Entertainment:\\nSome months ago the incredibly unsuccessful E100 tournament took place.\\nPlayers where hyped like ****, A FREAKING E100 IS BEING ADDED\\nWhat people didnt know was that the E100 would only be available to less than 1200 people that won these tournaments, for which you needed to pay to get tickets to play.\\nThe tournament was badly set up and full of hackers (Shhh Gaijin doesnt want us to know there are hackers)\\nOf course thousands of people complained in the forums, including myself.\\nMost of my comments where removed on the context of ''flaming'', some of those comments complained about the removals.\\nShortly after this, they introduced a rule that didnt allow people to post in the forums, unless they had played a certain number of battles prior to posting.\\nAfter receiving a warning for challenging moderation (lol) I got a message from a fellow forum user:\\n''The rule came about shortly after they removed Simulator Battles from the game.  It wasn't to keep the trolls at a minimum, it was to reduce the workload of the moderators after such a poor decision.\\n\\nScarper and Pacifica (two senior mods) are megalomaniacs.   Their egos get in the way of moderation.  Their extra comments on closed threads are often insulting and almost always condescending.  They show the community no respect at all and I believe it is only a symptom of Gaijin policy.  This was evident in the Youtube incident (if you are familiar I won't elaborate, but if you want to know more I'll elucidate)''\\nMore into this:\\nhttp://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/290640-community-relations-or-why-i-have-to-post-in-off-topic-discussions/\\nhttp://ritastatusreport.blogspot.com/2015/07/gaijin-shuts-down-youtubers-channel.html\\nhttp://www.polygon.com/2015/7/30/9068059/rogue-employee-holds-independent-youtube-channel-hostage-war-thunder\\n\\nMods from all around the globe are likely to downvote this, and I doubt this review will ever be viewed by many, but please, stay away from this toxic company while you can.\",\n",

Even though it only says i have 190 hours, I have closer to 4000 spread over a few accounts.\\n\\nA few years back, I would have given this game the biggest thumbs up that could possibly be received. I loved it, I played it day in day out. It was my favourite game and will likely hold that spot in my heart for a long time to come.\\n\\nHowever, recently, Gaijin has been taking some steps towards monetization in what is arguably the most scummy and \"fuck you\" method to the playerbase that I have ever seen in the gaming industry (yes, worse than EA).\\n\\nNot only that, but they seem to not care about the opinions of the player base, but continue to appeal to the wallet warriors only, as seen when they refuse to fix bugs that have been in the game for years, but continue to add copy past planes for 60 USD (see all F-5 variants). The core elements of the game that used to be fun have been ruined. Their continuining desire to add new things to please the wallet warriors has led to planes that have that been in the game since the beginning such as the Me 262 getting its shit kicked in as it has to face jets that are as old compared to it as you to your parents.\\nThey\\'re totally disconnected from the community, and currently, they are trying to implement more shitty features like adding an expiration date to items that we the players have been collecting over the years? Why is this important you may ask? Because the only way to get these is to get them from loot boxes that you have to buy and they\\'re trying to get us to do that :(\\n\\nI really love this game, no other game feels like this one does, but i cannot in good faith recommend it to you at this point in time.

       "  'review': \"Let's take a closer look at the peculiar case of War Thunder...\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+ Gameplay. War Thunder combines an arcade-like playstyle with an ultra realistic damage model, every player can find something for himself here. You can hop in for a quick and casual match, or you can be all tactical and competitive.\\n\\n+ Variety. Arguably the game's main selling point, the number of historical and modern vehicles is staggering. War Thunder offers hundreds of armored cars, light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, fighters, bombers, attack helicopters, motorboats, battleships and many more... all of that spread across multiple nations with their own quirks and different playstyles.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Matchmaking. Easily the single worst thing about this game. Each vehicle is given an arbitrary Battle Rating value and should only face similarily rated vehicles. At first glance this sounds fair, unfortunately it isn't. The entire BR range is way too compressed, and BR values are based on the averaged global statistics instead of the vehicle's true capabilities. This leads to completely absurd situations, such as late WW2 heavy tanks facing early MBTs with stabilized guns and HEATFS shells - ruining the experience for both.\\n\\n- Economy. Over the years Gaijin has been slowly tightening and rigging the game's economy. All kinds of battle rewards and multipliers have been slowly lowered or removed. The game is now at a point where you can no longer grind towards Rank IV or V without a premium account. You may even no longer be able to play some of your favourite vehicles because the repair costs will ruin you.\\n\\n- Premium vehicles. More and more of them have been added into the game with each subsequent update. Some of those premium vehicles are plain Pay2Win cases while others are abused for their increased rewards and multipliers. This leads to situations where entire BR ranges are dominated by the premium vehicle spam, for example: T-72AV (TURMS-T), KW I C, Ju 288, XP-50 and many more...\\n\\n- Staleness. Despite the variety found in tech trees, almost every other aspect of the game feels incredibly dated and uninspired. Entire game modes have not been touch in years and most new ground maps are poorly designed, half-empty, desert-like battlegrounds with recycled assets.\\n\\nIn conclusion: War Thunder has changed a lot over the years and it's been a downward spiral. It started off as a fun, competitive and semi-historical game which devolved into a weird, grindy and toxic chore. It's problems are now synergizing: bad matchmaking makes the economy issues worse, bad economy forces people to buy premiums, premiums ruin the matchmaking even further. War Thunder could be one of the greatest games out there, instead it choses to be unfun by design.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'i like the mechanics, but i HATE gaijins blatent greed in this game so i can not recommend it unless you are craving for a tank/planes/ship game. iv spent more than 1500 hours (played alot before it got added to steam) i have jets in most countrys, and have high tank br (7.0 up to highest 10.3) in 4 trees. and i freaquntly are the top player on my team, so i feel im confident in this statement. \\n\\nPositives:\\n* Good grapichs\\n* Core mechanics are nice\\n* HUGE tech trees\\n* versatility in what you can play (ships, tanks, helicopters and planes)\\n* Options for difficulty in Arcade, realistic and simulator modes\\n\\nNegatives:\\n* Gaijins absolutly disgusting monetization model \\n* its \"free\" until you get high enough and you wont earn money unless you are a top player.\\n* Gaijin don´t fix broken stuff, only add new vechicles thats op so ppl gotta buy them\\n* Maps are just absolutly shit, there is a a few \"ok\" maps, but the design is terrible and often one side will ahve a CLEAR advantage.\\n* Russian bias (Edited. i feel there is a bias towards the cost of russian tanks, as in they are cheaper to repair as such. Not a russian bias as in all their tanks are OP. commented below abit more regarding this)\\n* The progression without premium is SUCH a grind its insane, (ofc this is to make players pay for premium) \\n* the \"Rewards\" you get in those...battlepacks, are jsut not worth any, wagers/mission is mostly impossible for 99% of players stuff like \"get first AND last kill\" like are you kidding me? and i gotta do that 10 times? \\n* Maps are made for low/mid tier, when you get high tier often ppl can spawn kill straight from their spawn. \\n* Spawnkilling is INSANE!\\n* Playing tanks and only wanna play tanks? get readuy to be destroyed by planes and helicopters thatll bomb you without you having a chance.\\n\\nThere is ofc way more negatives, and if you look at the \"positive\" reviews you´ll also notice the sentence \"love hate relationship\" is pretty common. Its just NOT a good monitasation model, i woulden´t mind paying for stuff, but its so extremly overpriced and they try to FORCE you to get premium. iv played this game since way before it got added on steam, bc i love the mechanics it has. But gaijin is without a doubt a shitty company that somehow miracoulus got a good game. I hope they will ease up on the cost and also make changes to all their maps. But time has proven to me that they simply won´t do it. \\n\\ni do NOT recommend this for anyone who not absolutly need a new game like WoT genre or such. save your time and money for something els.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game itself is great, but the business model it uses is utter garbage.\\n\\nThe game has beautiful graphics, is very well optimized, gameplay is great, the damage system is the most realistic ever made.\\n\\nBut then the devs business model steps in. They want you to spend money on it, of course that\\'s natural, nobody works for free. But you can\\'t purchase the game. You may purchase only a handful of \"special\" vehicles.\\nIn a regular microtransation game business model, you are forced to grind to have items that you could have by paying extra money. If this is included in a game you already paid, many consider this itself a bad business model that does not respect the player\\'s time and is bad game design. If it\\'s included in a F2P game and the amount of money required to purchase all times by far exceeds the quality of the game and the market\\'s average price, then it\\'s considered pay to win. \\n\\nAnd what Gaijin Entertainment does? They DOUBLE IT DOWN, they make you pay so you can have the \"privilege\" of GRINDING LESS. But you still have to grind in one way or other. And it\\'s no small amount of grind either. See the slug on their company\\'s logo? That\\'s an excellent allegory to the slugish progress you make in this game. After some point of the game, you are not allowed to have bad luck. If you kill less than two or three enemies in a match, you will lose money. If you kill 5 or 6 enemies AND your team wins the game, you MAY gain about 2% or 3% of the money you need to purchase the next vehicle.\\n\\nHere is my current situation for example: I have a Tiger I tank. Every time my Tiger gets destroyed, I lose nearly 2500 to 3000 silver lions to repair it. Killing an enemy gives me around 1000 to 1200 silver lions, and you get about 3000 lions bonus if your brain dead teammates can actually help you to win the match. So I am forced to have a K/D ratio of 3.0 on every game so I can DREAM about buying my desired $170,000 Panther tank someday. After spending about 20 hours this weekend playing this game, keeping a positive K/D on most games I made about 80k lions. In two days of heavily grinding I got barely HALF of what I need to get ONE tank. And I am not even in the MIDDLE of the game, while endgame tanks costs over one million lions, so I can only expect things to get worse unless I start paying HUNDREDS of dollars to get premium currency that will still not grant me access to these vehicles in any way, and will just make things maybe SLIGHTLY easier. Even if killing moer advanced tanks will give me more money, repairing my more advanced tanks will also cost more moneys, which makes the game`s pace not change. So if I ever dream of unlocking all tanks so someday I can play with the Leopard II, I still need to sink 400 hours into this game, or pay the devs about 100 dollars of Premium currency to reduce my grind to \"just\" 200. And that\\'s just one tank segment of one faction.To get access to all tanks in the game it would cost THOUSANDS of dollars plus THOUSANDS of grind hours, or if I wanted to remain not paying anything, maybe 20k hours? Yeah, imagine thinking it\\'s okay to spend more time grinding in a game than you need to get a college degree.\\n\\n\\nLosing is part of every game, but this game punishes you by wasting your time and potentially taking away your money if you were iressponsible enough to spend it on this crap. Everytime I get a lucky kill by accidentaly flanking somebody I feel bad because I probably made somebody\\'s day worse by pushing their progress back and I didn\\'t even feel accomplished.\\nThe entire game is designed around mining your earnings and make you spend money. You need to buy shltty vehicles you don\\'t want to advance to the next tier. You need to purchase shltty vehicle modifications you don\\'t need to have access to the ones you want. For every new vehicle you buy, you need to spend money so you can INVENT FIRE STINGUISHERS AGAIN. Everything. Everytime. Everywhere, you need to spend your money. You are not even entitled to choose the maps you want to play. You can choose ONE map out of the map rotation IF you accept to pay for their shltty subscription service. And there you go. Playing on a map you hate. A map deliberately poorly designed. You take a wrong turn. Your tank falls into a ditch, and guess what? GUESS WHAT? You must spend money to repair it.\\nLike, you have a Panzer IV Ausf. G, then you \"want\" to go to the Panzer IV Ausf H  (like, even if you don\\'t want you have no choice, you are forced to researcha and purchase every useless vehicle in the tecthree to unlock new ones) Ausf. G you must research EVERYTHING again, despite the  Ausf. H being literally just the  Ausf. G with some useless armor plate skirts added.\\n\\nAh, and you must pay for the AMMO you use. That\\'s serious.\\nI wonder how long it will take until they decide to charge us for the FUEL of the tanks. Or to pay wages to the tank crews. Like, they can use the excuse that they are trying to make the game more \"realistic\", and make you need to pay wages for the crews, pay for their dental plan, for their children\\'s colleges. \" Wellcome back, your crewmember Hans has suffered a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. 40k lions have been taken from your account to pay for his medical expenses\".\\n\\nI would gladly pay $60 to play this game with at least all WW2 tanks.\\nBut all their offers are laughable. They are right now charging 30 dollars for a shitty T-34 tank and people are buying it. Yes, you heard right. A SINGLE vehicle that is just a slight upgrade of an existing free version.\\n\\nAnd yes, there is also the famous Russian bias. The devs are russians, and they are shamessly nationalistic and not afraid of trying to make their nation look the best. And how they do this in a game which takes pride of it\\'s extremely realistic vehicle stats? If they lie about the vehicle specs people will just check them in Wikipedia to call them out. What they do? Simple! Match them in anachronic fights. The IS-2 only saw action in 1944, mostly fighting against Tiger II tanks and Jagdpanzers. So you make it show up early to fight 1942 Tiger I, Panzer IVs, and Shermans instead. The PT-76 was one of the most useless tanks of the Cold War? A light tank that could barely hold itself against infantry? Well then just make it show up TEN YEARS earlier to fight early WW2 tanks. But yet it all backfired. In this poor attempt to overcompensate their insecurity and irrational patriotism, the devs just accidentaly showed how bad Soviet armor was, by proving that is completely possible for a SHERMAN to kill Cold-War Soviet tanks. Hilarious.\\nI don\\'t know about the Air Battles mode (I refuse to touch that mode with a ten foot pole. I\\'m h ere only for the tanks). But I heard from friends that Soviet planes are capable of ridiculously unrealistic feats.\\n\\nOn this state, I would refuse to spend 10 cents on this game. I just want to get a nice mug of black cofee in a rainy day, sit back and relax, drive my Tiger across the green hills while I listen to some classical music and calmly try to spot enemies with my bynoculars, and this is currently not possible with all the grinding pressure the game currently has.  I will come back again in a few years, maybe people will start to get tired of this game. Now there are no more new tanks to add. I don`t think they will be adding more modern aircraft because I doubt a game that prides itself of it`s realism would want to make F-15s and MiG-31s dogfight. (A F-4 vs. MiG-21 is the most modern dogfight you can get. More modern aerial warfare than that is basically just dots beeping in the radar and getting shot across the continent). Hopefully this game\\'s development cycle will end soon, people will start to leave due the lack of new content, and the devs may reduce these ridiculous grinding requirements to attract people back. Until then, I would not recommend anybody to waste their time with this grindfest. Go play games that respect your time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game asked me in a pop-up to leave a review similar to how a mobile game does. You want my review? He\\'s my review. I have waay more hours into this game than what Steam says. I\\'ve been playing this game since 2014 most of the time without Steam and with Gaijin\\'s own launcher. Gaijin is one of the most greediest, inept, and downright scummy developers I\\'ve had the unfortunate fate to stumble upon.\\n\\nGripe #1: The Grind\\nThis game takes months without spending real money to get the next vehicle you want once you reach Tier III. I remember being super excited to get to research my Tiger I H1 (long before the E ever came out) and it taking me close to 2 months of grinding just to get enough research to unlock it. The Tiger 1 H1 at this point is only a mid-tier vehicle. Imagine the grind once you get to modern vehicles. I\\'m currently researching the F-104A, this jet takes 390,000 research points, in a good game where you don\\'t immediately get thrashed (very common see Gripe #3 for more details) you earn about 1500 research points. A typical game lasts about 20 minutes. At this rate it would take you 260 good games or 86 hours of continuously sweat level gaming to unlock this jet without real money. That is close to half a week of no sleep, no family, and no job to unlock this jet and this isn\\'t even taking into account Gripe #3.\\n\\nGripe #2: The Economy\\nAnother way Gaijin entices you to spend real money is through the economy of the game. In this game, you have a multitude of purchases you have to make to progress and do good. These purchases are facilitated by the in-game currency you earn through play. There are many upgrades that you purchase in this way for your vehicles that bring you onto a level playing field because most people will have the upgrades and will put you at a severe disadvantage. For instance, just unlock that new shiny tank that you\\'ve been grinding for weeks? Well now you need to get the upgrades for it. One of the upgrades is a fire extinguisher. Take a shell to the fuel tank and it set your tank on fire? You need the fire extinguisher. It is one of the most crucial upgrades you will need. Bomber drops a bomb on your tank in spawn and takes out your engine? Guess you\\'ll be sitting in spawn for the whole time you want to use that tank or bail out early and pay full repair cost. Oh what\\'s repair cost? Only the most infuriating aspect of the economy. Its pretty simple, your vehicle blow up? You pay in-game currency to repair it so you can use it again. You want to know how repair costs are determined? Oh funny you should ask. They have a base cost that is then raised based on the VERY upgrades you need to do good. How is base cost determined? Who knows, its completely arbitrary. Have a tank that Gaijin thinks is too good for the tanks it faces? Lets just up the repair cost on that so you lose money every time you want to use the awesome tank you spent weeks grinding. Yes, once you get to higher tier (4+) more often than not you will be losing in-game currency instead of earning more like you did in the previous tiers. All of this together is meant to force you to buy premium or buy the currency outright. This wouldn\\'t be so bad if the prices weren\\'t so sky high ridiculous. Want premium for the month that will cut your grind in half? Cough up $10 a month. Don\\'t have any enough in-game currency to buy that F-104A? That will be $20 dollars to just BUY the jet. You still have to pay to select a crew for the jet and even more to for the upgrades on the jet that should come standard. You\\'re looking at about $35 to get just 1 jet airworthy.\\n\\nGripe #3: The Time Machine/Veteran Vehicle? Mo Problems\\nThis gripe could actually be two gripes but they are so closely related I\\'ll bunch them together. So to start with vehicles have arbitrary battle rating that Gaijin gives each vehicle so that they can matchmake their games and attempt to have balanced games. The only problem is that these battle ratings are often historically inaccurate and would never take place in the real world. Battle ratings exist to punish good vehicle designs. Here\\'s an example, remember my Tiger I H1 from above? It has a battle rating of 5.3. The way matchmaking works is this tank can be placed against any other vehicle within 1 full point of it. Now \"Wait\" you say \"Doesn\\'t that mean you have the opportunity to stomp lesser tanks?\" Yes that is a possibility but most of the time that won\\'t happen the way the game actually carries out matchmaking is that it will \"uptier\" you. What I mean by this is say you were in that Tiger I H1 90% of the time you are going to be placed in the higher 6.3 battle rating games. Now beings that you are in a German tank, you\\'re going to primarily see Soviet and American vehicles pitted against you. So what are some vehicles that exist at the same battle rating as your Tiger from these other countries? First one that comes to mind is the PT-76B. The PT-76B is a 1950s era Soviet APC/ARV. A 1950s vehicle going up against a vehicle that was design a whole decade prior. This is extremely broken in play as the PT-76B has access to more modern munitions that will slice through your Tiger like butter and has better acceleration due to its low weight. Absolutely broken. For the Americans you have a slew of Shermans with 76mm high velocity guns. Never mind the fact that most Shermans at this point still had 75mm guns that shot slow rounds. We\\'re sending your Tiger against vehicles that were meant to contend with your big brothers the King Tiger and Panther. Lets move the examples over to my other grind, American planes. I have a F-86F-25 Sabre. I regularly encounter AV-8 Harriers. A jet that was produced for Korea is going against a 1970s jet that is still in service today. You will get eaten alive by the air-to-air missiles that other jets have that your Sabre does not because they either weren\\'t invented yet or Gaijin added your version of the Sabre in before they embraced modern vehicles and their modern armaments. That\\'s right, I can go find Sabres that were added more recently in other countries\\' tech trees that have air-to-air missiles but the COUNTRY THAT DESIGNED THE JET AND THE MISSILES THE OTHER JETS HAVE does not have a single Sabre with missiles. This illustrates that Gaijin does not care about making veteran players happy. They only care about releasing the next vehicle to bring in more cash so they can line their pockets.\\n\\nIn summary, do not download this game, do not give this scummy company your hard earned greenbacks, and most certainly do not think they actually care about your criticism. These issues have persisted in the game for years and they have not lifted a finger to correct them. There are many more issues I could of discussed but these are the three that come to the top of my mind that infuriate me the most about this game. You could google \"gaijin.net agent\" or \"war thunder shill\" to get a quick glance at a couple other issues.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This. Game. Will. Break you.\\nI only have 90 hours on the Steam version of WT, but I have been playing this game since before Ground Forces came out (before tanks were added, and the game only had planes). Back then, it was pretty good. But as time went on, Gaijin decided to enter a competition with EA for Most Scummy Developers...and won. The grinding is unbelievable; you can forget about driving any of the cool tanks you recognize or flying any of the famous planes. If you absolutely MUST have the cool vehicles, then I hope you either have a lot of disposable income, or you\\'re willing to sacrifice a whole year of your life playing this game.\\n\\nIf you\\'re like me, you\\'ll start out patiently grinding, but eventually, inevitably, this game will break you. They say certain games are designed to be literally addictive- this is one of those games. You will suddenly find yourself willing to spend money you don\\'t even have in order to buy your way to the next level of aircraft, or pay just to have that new tank you unlocked \"upgraded\" so it becomes actually useful. You will become tempted to spend \"just another\" 5 bucks to make your pilot an ace, or to make your tank crew well-trained. You will be tantalized with pretty war machines to crack open your wallet once more, just so you can buy a \"premium\" vehicle that Gaijin will end up nerfing or even deleting a couple months later.\\n\\nThe entire game is designed to tease you and make you give up your money. There are shiny, premium vehicles galore. You can pay premium currency to skip past boring vehicles. After unlocking a new vehicle, it will barely be able to move or maneuver and will even be unable to repair broken parts...but you can make all those problems go away with another $5. Tired of boring one-tone paint for your tank? Buy a snazzy new camouflage. Have you finally reached the cool, high-level vehicles? Oh no, if they die in battle it costs you more money just to repair them than you make in that battle. Better spend another few bucks. Want to make your vehicle able to be used more than once per battle? Give Gaijin some money and you can do that. Are you tired of only being able to have two decals on your vehicle? Money can fix that! Do you just want one badass plane or tank to use forever, and you don\\'t care about any other vehicles? You can buy most high-level vehicles for $40 or more.\\n\\nThe jokes and memes are true, this game makes EA games look generous. Don\\'t play it. Even if you are the most pure-hearted, anti-microtransaction player who has locked all their money in an underground vault, don\\'t play it. The game is thoroughly engineered at every level so that you have to spend money to make the game fun enough to keep playing.\\nI barely went into detail. If you want to know the full pain, read some of the other long reviews.',\n",

       "  'review': '\"You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain\"\\n\\nThis game was once a gem of F2P games. Unique, engaging gameplay, fresh concept, good balance of grind and microtransactions. Friendly developers loving their game and not at all greedy. Paving the way of new generation in MMO games.\\nI cant exactly put my finger on the exact moment when the game turned to worse. Maybe it was introduction of Abrams, maybe it was much earlier. No matter. \\nAs it stands now its aggresively monetized shitfest with developers that dont play their own game, dont communicate with playerbase and terrible moderators that filter out criticism causing more harm. Every patch logical and understandable changes are mixed with bad not well thought features that progressively make whole game worse and worse.\\n\\nGame is still solid in certain aspects and playing certain vehicles is fun. But on the whole i wouldnt recommend it to anybody.\\n\\nToo much focus was laid on monetization and somwhere in this pursuit of dollars terrible thing happened - game has lost its charm and became a chore to play. It was a long ride War Thunder. I will keep good memories.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Update:\\nSince posting my below review it should be noted:\\n[list]\\n    [*]None of the below mentioned issues have been fixed, or even remotely addressed. The developers are fundamentally and completely deaf to any and all community feedback and/or taking basic quality assurance measures in maintaining the game.\\n    [*]Multiple new, game breaking issues have been introduced, and game balance continues to deteriorate. Additional pay to win premium vehicles have been introduced, as well as extremely unfair ingame events based around squeezing money out of players through the game\\'s online marketplace,\\n    [*]The game continues to be based around a single core design concept: strongarm players into paying exorbitant amounts of money through intentionally damaging the quality of the core gameplay loop and dangling solutions in front of the player that must be repeatedly paid for.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThe game is, has been, and will remain utterly terrible.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nAs a disclaimer, I exclusively play this game for the ground forces mode, so won\\'t be addressing the air combat or naval modes, though in general many of my larger points carry over in some way.\\n\\nFirst off, what this game does well:\\n[list]\\n    [*]The modeling of the vehicles is amazing. Both in terms of detail and (mostly) in terms of handling, the models and effects for each vehicle make for a truly beautiful experience, especially when compared with other competitors in the armored combat game genre.\\n    [*]The actual basic gameplay mechanics of the ground combat are excellent. The realistic way in which vehicle damage and dynamics are modeled gives the game a weighty feel that captures the subject matter with enjoyable heft. Driving a tank in War Thunder feels much more fundamentally appealing than in other competing games such as World of Tanks.\\nThe rush of successfully scoring a kill in armored combat is awesome, and has kept me coming back for more despite the game\\'s many glaring flaws.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWith that out of the way, here are some of the reasons I do not recommend anyone pick up this game, even at the entry price of free:\\n[list]\\n    [*]The ingame economy and progression system is an exploitative, broken, and endlessly aggravating mess that has been terrible since the game first launched and has received only the tiniest of improvements over the many years it has been in active development. The rate of gain for \\'Research Points\\', the experience points used to unlock new vehicles, and \\'Silver Lions\\', the currency actually used to buy things, are both horrifically low, with the express goal of getting you to purchase \\'Golden Eagles\\', the game\\'s shiny play money that costs real money and can be used to effortlessly breeze your way forward so long as you\\'re willing to drop hundreds if not thousands of dollars (US, or your regional conversion) into the game.\\nRewards for gameplay are terribly low in the first place, but only get worse when you realize that [i]the game makes you pay to repair your vehicles and buy more ammunition after each battle[/i]. That\\'s right, if your vehicle is damaged or destroyed in a match, you have to pay Silver Lions to repair it. Even worse, each vehicle has unlockable ammo types, which are almost always much better than the vehicle\\'s free stock ammunition, each round of which will cost you more Silver Lions to purchase. This gets especially bad with high tier vehicles, the constant hype machines that the game uses to lure people in, resulting in many matches where you will lose significant sums of money if you miss a shot or have your vehicle damaged or destroyed. Given that the whole point of the game is to fight other players using, you know, tanks with guns on them, you will generally end close to 50% of your games looking at being charged for your insolence in thinking you can actually play the vehicles you spent hundreds of hours grinding to use.\\nAnd the vehicle grind? If you want to have the privilege of driving that shiny M1A1 or T-80u you had better be prepared to play every day for several years to top even one nation\\'s tech tree, which will probably be soured in the end because of the game constantly introducing unbalanced new units instead of fixing any of the glaring issues with the economy and progression system.\\n    [*]The balance. There is no balance. Vehicles are thrown with minimal concern across the Battle Rating (a number used to quantify a vehicle\\'s power and match it with similar vehicles) field, constantly leaving you fighting much more powerful units as you painfully claw your way up the tech tree, only to finally reach top tier and...\\nThere is also zero balance at top tier. New units are introduced constantly to keep the game rolling on announcement hype, with little concern for their performance or the meta they will create. The only pitiful excuse for balance the developers do implement is in increasing the costs for repairs and ammunition for over-performing vehicles, which does nothing but ensure that players who pay real money for in-game currency (did I mention you can just straight up buy Silver Lions with Golden Eagles? No? Yeah.) have a quantitative advantage in being able to operate overpowered units in every match, while those who refuse to invest their life savings into the game are left out in the cold, unable to pay the repair costs on vehicles they spent hundreds of hours earning.\\nIt gets even better when you introduce aircraft into the mix, because all modes for ground vehicles are actually \"Mixed Battles\", which let aircraft and helicopters join in on the fun. What I mean by \\'join in on the fun\\' is that in most matches where you play a tank you will end up being killed by a plane dropping a bomb on you rather than being destroyed by another tank. This only gets worse in top tier matches, where helicopters can hover at extreme range from the battlefield and one-shot-kill tanks using anti-tank guided missiles, which they get a large number of, meaning that you have to spend half your time trying to enjoy playing a ground vehicle constantly looking out for and dodging air vehicles. The developers\\' fix for this? Introduce overpowered anti-aircraft ground units, which are of course top-tier vehicles that you are required to grind for.\\nThis is all made much, much worse by the design of the maps that you do your actual fighting on, most of which look very nice, but are some of the worst I have ever seen in terms of game design. Sight lines are nonsensical and cover is scattered around seemingly at random, with many maps allowing enemy vehicles to find ways to shoot into one team\\'s spawn locations from the mid point of the map, leaving players respawning late in the game to be instantly annihilated. And added bonus is that there\\'s also nothing to prevent aircraft from camping players leaving their spawns, meaning that you might not even get the chance to see your enemy before a bomb or missile exterminates you 10 meters from your spawn point.\\n    [*]The bugs. There have been reasonable improvements in the game over time in the bug department, but there still remain many annoying issues that will swoop in to disrupt your experience. The game\\'s physics engine is a common culprit, ensuring your tank is launched into the air by a rock or killed by an enemy shell that ricochets through the Nth dimension to somehow wipe out your vehicle. It\\'s less of a pain point than the above points, but it does happen, and it will ruin your day.\\n[/list]\\n\\nAll in all War Thunder offers a unique and compelling gameplay experience that I do not recommend anyone check out, because it serves only as a lure for a terribly unfair monetization scheme backed up by countless glaring issues in basic game design that will leave you  gnashing your teeth and swearing profusely far more often than delivering the tantalizing enjoyment that the game might otherwise deliver.\\n\\nIt\\'s not worth your time, and it\\'s definitely not worth your money.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Update after 3 years: \"The game got worse, now on top of the already existing unparalleled anti-consumer practices, they added battle passes and drove the prices in the player market to extremes. The game requires now ALL your free time, or a large part of your wallet. Even in that case, you will never be able to get all the vehicles, so if you have a completionist urge and are not interested in spending 2000$ for a vehicle, stay away.\"\\n\\nOriginal Review\\nI am playing War Thunder since the beta, when unlocking planes was actually enjoyable and there were no \"stock\" useless vehicles. Many \"new\" simpleminded fans that defend Gaijin don\\'t know that this game didn\\'t have a research system back then, while now it even has the same spotting mechanics of World of Tanks. Although they\\'re more refined, like pretty much every aspect of the game. This one can be considered as a semi-sim with also an arcade mode.\\n\\n[i]I own a Premium Account since release and most premium vehicles. Please read it trough the end, because this review is not about the quality of its gameplay, it goes beyond that. I hope Gaijin will notice the reviews and understand why the population has dropped trough the years, with an average of 80-100k players online before the 1.37 (when there was no research system), to an average of 30-40k (with tanks too). Triple the content, less than half population.[/i]\\n\\nAfter all the miscommunications (bugs being fixed a year after the community notified it, disliked events, introduction of loot boxes to get old-limited-events vehicles and more) and the continuous mocking and hostility of the moderator [b]Stona[/b] towards members of the community, even when they only ask for changes to the balancement or japanese prototype tanks (they have a poor tree and are unplayable), I thought that I had to write a new review for the game.\\n\\nWhat can I say, the War Thunder has gone a long way since then. New nations, an entire new tank-based game (Ground Forces) and the announcement of the both ships and helicopters in the near future. It\\'s sad to see the player base dropping costantly every year, since the 100k+ that were when we had only planes, to 20-30k.\\nUnfortunately, while the content has slowly got better, the progression has not. I also made the horrible choice to grind Japan. While the first two tiers are enjoyable by free2players too, the higher we go on the research tree, the worst it get, to a point where dying may even give you a negative amount of money. To me, with a premium account and 50€ premium tanks with extra rewards, it may not be a problem, but it is to anyone else. The grinding for research points gets tedious since mid-game for tanks and late-game for planes, and you have to consider also the amount of money needed to do everything: \\nDo you want to buy an unlocked vehicle? Buy it. Do you want to equip it to a crew? Pay (even 290k for top tiers). Do you want to shoot? Buy the ammo, Is it broken? Buy the repair service. What about events? Pay for the ticket.\\nSure, it is immersive to pay for some features, but all of this balance create a lot of issues to other players. \\n\\nAnd what about the modifications? When you research and buy a vehicle, it doesn\\'t come at his max potential. It\\'s a stock vehicle, with basic ammo, a worst engine and whatsoever. If you\\'re interested in planes you should be good, your plane will be usually worse than the others but you\\'ll be able to play and slowly spade it (i.e. max it). Oh you\\'re interested in tanks?\\n\\nThen [b] welcome to fucking hell.[/b]\\n\\nTo make a tank playable you usually need at least two upgrades: Parts and FPE. Parts is an upgrade that let you repair your vehicle, FPE is an extinguisher to put off the fire. To get the FPE you first need to unlock another upgrade, so a total of 3 upgrades are necessary. MANY tanks are also useless at their battle rating (another issue which I\\'ll describe later) and to make them playable you\\'ll need advanced ammo, which may request up to 4-5 upgrades first.\\n\\n[i]\"Hey but I just unlocked the parts with one match\"[/i]\\n\\nHeh, sure it\\'s good to play at Rank I-II, when you only 2-5k research points each. At Rank V-VI it becomes 16-24k, even 40k in some cases.\\n\\nImagine having to grind 16k (Average f2p gets 2-3k I think, when it actually get kills. A premium player with a premium vehicle usually get 10k) without penetrating ammo, without being able to repair as soon as something hit you and with the survivability of a dodo. What if I matchmake your tank to an higher battle rating? Owww damn, your tank exploded right away, it was expectable indeed. Pay me 8k please to repair it.\\n\\nRepeat that for every new vehicle you\\'ll unlock. Welcome to Ground Forces. Fortunately you can pay to buy a Rank IV/V premium vehicle and enjoy the bonus rewards and a fully spaded tank. 49,99€ over your sanity. And don\\'t forget to buy the experience for your crew or they will suck. Always, even after 200hr you will not have enough experience to max a single crew and you\\'ll pay real money to do that.\\n\\nLast, about that battle rating I mentioned: it basically represent the strenght of a tank on a fictional \"tier list\".  It influence the matchmaking. Whenever you queue the game uses your highest rated vehicle in your formation and searches for other players with the same battle rating OR a fluctuation of +1/-1. If you use a 6.7 tank, you may end up with other tanks from 5.7 to 7.7.\\nObviously the chance you will end up in a 7.7 match are 80% and guess what, most tanks will become extremely hard to play and - if lacking FPE/Parts/ammo - the may become completely useless.\\n\\nMix all of that and do your math. It\\'s a well-made game, fun, varied and with both arcade and simulative modes, but this is really infuriating and has to stop. Get back on track.\\n\\n\\nGaijin will never read this, but by making these two small changes they would make it surely more fun and bring back the community. The reduced matchmaking would be compensated by bigger numbers. I\\'d also remove the \"Parts\" from the game, but I guess that\\'s too much to ask to Gaijin.\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]+50% rewards to all vehicles (they use visible % under every vehicle to balance the rewards)\\n    [*]Reduce the matchmaking from +1/-1 to +0.7/-0.7.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThere are more than 1000 vehicles right now, at least 3 more than when it started. It\\'s time to reduce the grinding to these new standards. Even more if we include the upcoming ships, the italian army and the mentioned \"two new nations in the next years\". How is a new player supposed to reach rank III/IV in three different modes and multiple nations?\\nMost new players stop after third/fourth rank of a single nation. I am sure that letting them focus on more nations wouldn\\'t reduce the income, they will probably end up buying more premium vehicles.',\n",

       "  'review': 'DON\\'T TOUCH THIS. War Thunder is the most addictive, yet toxic game i haver ever played. Only reason anyone plays this is because this is because there is no other game like it. Ofcourse there is world of planes, tanks, ships. But none of them have the \"realism\" theme that WT has. You play and get hooked with how good the planes look and it\\'s pretty easy in the start with you being able to get a new vehicle every 10,20,30 matches and upgrades every 2nd match. But then you get to 4.0 and then the grind hits, you need to play for hours every day just to make any progress or keep up with one tech tree not mentioning 1 or 2. Which is when people just pay for premium accounts, and new vehicles. I mean we get it, you have to put food on the table, but This. This is just greed, if you want to ever see jets you\\'re going to have to pay, if you want to finish a single tech tree without paying? \"Play\" for 6-8 hours every day for years and you might get to cold war era tech. Eventualy you get bored and leave, but then find nothing else like WT and eventually come crawling back to this psycho abusive bitch girlfriend of a game. IF there was ever a single company that would announce a game with the same concept, and didn\\'t abuse it\\'s playerbase and listend to them even for one time, it would take about 2 weeks for everyone to forget this game',\n",

       "  'review': \"*3200 hours* As you can see I have devoted way to much time into this game and I will likely continue because I feel that I have already invested too much to just drop this game. The biggest issue with this game is the devs, or atleast their corporate. (Now don't think i'm just some commie that doesn't like capitalism). Gaijin constantly says that they wont do this or wont do that but they turn right around and use some loop hole to claim that they didn't break their promise. This is most visible with the KA-50 helicopter. They claimed they would never add top tier premiums then about a year later added the KA-50, which is a helicopter that is put one rank below top rank and .3 BR lower than top tier. It sits behind a $50 price wall. They do shet like this all the time. The community gets mad at them and Gaijin just goes look at this new thing for you to spend hours of your free time to get and the community shuts up and licks it all up and acts like nothing happened till something else happens. Gaijin is inconsistent with what they say when it comes to balance. They have just left the game mode that started this thing on the back burner for years. And with all the issues this game has they just add more crap and wont fix their game. The community has been asking for a much needed BR decompression but Gaijin refuses and continues to make their game worse by adding more and more. this game could be so much better if Gaijin would listen to the player base and try to make things better rather than pat their bottom line constantly, so you have been warned play this game at the risk to your own sanity. Clearly mine left long ago.\\n\\n*5328 hours* Please help meeeeee just end it now\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I genuinely once believed in Gaijin to be a reasonable company that would put aside moronic and neanderthalic greed in place for a game that could bring in a larger audience and expose to a larger audience the appeal to being an armchair weapon and vehicle historian. However ever since 2012 my hours used in this game have only proven me wrong as time has gone on, I\\'ve unlocked almost every vehicle, every achievement, and yet everytime I play this game I feel like a battered house wife in an abusive relationship with a husband who sells his wife just to make his own business gain more profit. As such I always have strong feelings for when a change is implemented and when the game is \"rebalanced\" for the sake of \"fun\". The game isn\\'t fun, the game is in fact a chore to play. You genuinely have a better chance to get a part time job and just buy a T-72 irl, that\\'s how much the grind is in this game. By the time you would have spent 5 years irl saving up money to buy a soviet armored car, you would have gotten the same vehicle in this god forsaken game. The game always remains with potential to become far grander in scale and if anything far more entertaining in execution. However, gaijin as a company is no worse in greed than EA. EA by comparison, has far more respect from me than Gaijin simply due to their transparency to their choices and their greed, I at the very least am given an explanation as of to why such changes are applied to an EA game, however with Gaijin it\\'s just radio silence no matter the change. One day you will have a new vehicle working just fine, and the next patch the vehicle is upside down and flying into the sky just like the 1.64 patch with the flying upside down churchills... I genuinely believe you have a better chance working and slaving away in a part time job at amazon than you would spending the same amount of time in this game to get a high tier vehicle. As such, in conclusion, save your time and money, just play something else',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have a hard time recommending this game right now, and I will explain why....\\n\\nAt least here on steam, I don’t have to worry about being bullied by Gaijin for writing a critical review. I really want to like this game. Unlike a lot of kiddies who post on the forums, I am much older. I am a gamer from the 80's, growing up on simulators from the 80's and 90's like F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Interceptor, Birds of Prey, Their Finest Hour, Knights of the Sky, etc. These were on the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, etc. \\n\\nIf you are younger and unfamiliar with these titles, look them up. It will give you an idea of how long I have been around flying the cyber skies and coming from an experienced point of view.  I guess that's why I am amused when kids try to lecture players who have been flying sims for decades before they were even on the earth. So, for the younger among us, you can learn something from your elders. \\nWarthunder is very frustrating, it has the potential to be a really good game, but instead is held back by Russian nationalism and left over cold war era mentalities. \\n\\nI have spent many hours and money on this game, I have supported them financially and really have given them time to fix their problems, unfortunately they continue to run with a delusional narrative. \\n\\nOften you will hear people claim there is a Russian bias to the game. Well, to be blunt, yes, it true. The only people who argue otherwise always prove to be A) of Russian decent themselves and take it personally, B) Are apologists for Gaijin and tote the typical fan boy nonsense, or C) They use Russian tanks or planes and are comfortable in their over powered vehicles, afraid they will be taken away. \\n\\nRecently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…\\n\\nSo what does this mean exactly?....Basically he is saying they’re going to fudge the facts for the sake of Russian ego?\\nI take issue with Warthunder because Gaijin continues to claim they strive for “historical accuracy” however they have shown no real attempt to make that so. \\n\\nThey make disparaging comments about German WWII tanks, planes and tech of the era. They claim their hardware was inferior to Soviet hardware, and all the publications that say otherwise is pure “western propaganda”.\\nAny objective student of WWII history knows the Germans were known for having very advanced superior equipment. There is a reason Both the U.S. and the Soviets were grabbing up as many German scientist and tech as they could at the end of the war. \\n\\nThe Planes and Tanks\\n\\nWarthunder has dishonestly taken Russian planes that were underperforming or produced in low numbers, and exaggerated their abilities. They also have a whole SEPARATE development team for the Russian planes vs the rest of the planes. What does that tell you? \\n\\nThe P-38 lightning doesn’t perform anything like its real counterpart, I thought, “man, this plane flies like crap”, so I did some research. I found out that Gaijin gave the P-38 a heavy bomber/fighter flight model, they assigned the A-20 flight model to the P-38 lighting! But wait, what did they do with Russian planes that had unfinished flight models? They were simply void of any drag penalties. Instead, they left out variables on the planes, causing them to perform UFO like Arial maneuvers. \\n\\nThe bombers are all nerfed with bomb load capacity, however without any explanation, the Russian Yer is conveniently left without the same changes, and is allowed a higher capacity. \\n\\nALL U.S. Navy aircraft are atrocious. They don’t perform near to their real models. The  F-4U Corsair, which was nick named “whispering death” by the Japanese can’t be flown more than two minutes without it beginning to overheat. \\n\\nThe P-63, which was not a very good plane in general, is given super capabilities. Gee…is that because the Russians used this plane in the war from Lend Lease? Well, what does this tell you? If you look up the P-63 for the Americans, and the P-63 for the Russians, WOW!....the P-63 for the Russians is magically superior in performance despite being an export of the same plane. \\n\\nThe bombers?....They use to perform ok. Now their destroyed with a massive nurf where a couple of shots from a machine gun will explode a B-29! Its truly ridiculous. \\n\\nWanting to see for myself, I began to fly Russian planes. Sure enough, the ease in which I could fly around and destroy the enemy with ease was absurd. I shook my head in disgust and quit right there. I later came back and tried again, yet the same thing is happening in tanks as well. You have T-34’s driving around pawning Tigers for crying out loud. \\nThere is so much examples of this, we could be here all day. This is only further supported by their absurd forum posts where they talk about Soviet tech being superior to all other nations in WWII. It really is amazing how strong their bias truly is. \\n\\nThen, Gaijiin behaves like a bunch of KGB thugs. If ANYONE brings up anything deemed slightly critical on their forums, ALL dissent is immediately locked, silenced and deleted. Threads are deleted or locked, and people get banned, simply for holding an opinion they don’t like. Google Gajiin extorion scandal\\n\\nThat behavior alone truly is disgusting. Here is a real kicker though….look at Gaijiin rules for the games. They state that “historical characters who violated human rights are not permitted to be mentioned”. \\n\\nHmm…so History they don’t approve of is out, talking about history is out….but here is the best part. Hitler is a no no…can’t talk about him. But wait!......Stalin, a monster who arguably was just as bad if not worse than Hitler, killing 20 million or more of his own people, he is perfectly fine! In fact, Warthunder will even let you put the words “For Stalin” in Russian on the side of your tank or plane! YAY for double standards! \\n\\nTeam Work?.....foget about it! You have kids flying around ramming, or...while you are working on a plane, they will show no dicipline or respect at all. Rather then hold off your wiing, they will try to fly in front of you while your shooting, and take your kill! Now, 3 things happen here. A} They fly infront of your fire and get hit, then you get penalized for team damge. They also will idiotically accuse you of twam killing. B) they dont get hit by your fire, but cause you to have to break off to avoid a collsion and screw up your kill. Or C) they collide into you, and then accuse you of ramming them. \\n\\nThere is no mutual respect for team work in this game. It would help if they would implement coms for the whole team, and allow more then 4 players in a squad. Another nice feature would be the ability to fly in the same plane. Firends should be able to get in a bomber together. \\nAs of now, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad seems to be clearly much better. \\nIn the end, this is a good game that could be great. It really could be. Unfortunately, it’s undermined by its own developers who have been spoon fed Communist era propaganda to the point of absurdity, who then turns around and can’t help but put it in their own game, only to pull oppressive tact by silencing anyone who dares to point out such nonsense. \\nI have been waiting a long time for them to get with the program; unfortunately I am most likely waiting in vain. \\nWarthunder has become nothing but a propaganda mill, with Delusional re-writes of history where Red Army planes filled the skies and dominated over the Luftwaffe and all other nations. It’s a joke and insult to call this poor excuse of a “simulator” anything close to being “historically accurate”…only in the world of Commie make believe is this game close to anything historical. \\n\\nSadly, I’ll probably still play this game, only to be constantly reminded of how great it could be. I have given Gaijin about $100.00 of my money, and sadly I will never get its worth.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'after around 8000 hours total playtime, i cant recommend this game. it sucked me in, it removed my soul. it caused me years of addicting frustration. now there is absolutely nothing left holding me. the grind is insufferable, the stock grind encouraging you to spend real money unless you are willing to play a vehicle for 10-100 games to unlock its full potential, the higher the tier goes the worse it gets. and also the more noticable the stock syndrom becomes. this game is beginner unfriendly, bad match making. Gaijin over the years has turned into nothing but a greedy company. they used to care alot more about the game  back in the days, and in my opinion, the moment they decided to add the IS6 it all went downhill, because what followed after sooner or later were top tier premiums. before they never touched that, there werent nearly as many power creeping ridiculously viable premium machines. let alone beginners ruining high tier just because they opened their wallet, its ridiculous, pathetic, and infuriating. the only good thing i have to say about this game is arcade tanks nowadays and arcade/realistic air for props. jets are a no go. the more modern jet games all end within 3-8 minutes starting the moment you spawn on the runway. the f100 era and alike are barely playable because of guess what, pay to win jets you can see, that have missiles you cannot defend against in most subsoncis, let alone most super sonics, of course its also the premiums that get the good missiles and counter measures 90% of the time.\\ni have never seen a game thats in such a pathetic and awful state as war thunder.\\ntouching anything above ww2 era honestly just makes me suicidal. blatant and obvious cash grabs, there is absolutely nothing else to this game anymore.\\nsure the game might be fun for the first 100-1000 hours for any beginner that decides to stick with gaijins BS but the flaws sooner or later will be noticed by said beginners to a point where they cant enjoy the game anymore either.\\nand dont get me started on the piss poor map design, its nonexistent, its either brawl maps or maps where you camp at 5KM distance, and both suck. the map designing is just as bad as in world of tanks lmao.\\nthe only time where jet gameplay for super sonics becomes fun is the EC maps (basically gigantic maps) but they only happen rarely in the rotation.\\nthen gaijin has poor noodle coding, where a bug fix causes 2 new bugs. a new feature causes 5 other bugs.\\nits a never ending nightmare at this point.\\nreally just dont ever start playing this game for the sake of your own sanity, and if you do, i can assure you that anyone will be fed up within 100-1000 hours even if they turn into a god tier player with a solid 5-10 KD.\\nmy PoV is being an above average player, but lets be real here 95% of the active playerbase currently are just average players with a 1-1.5KD.^\\n\\nupdate 1,\\nnow there has been a very fun memory leak with all games modes except for air realistic/arcade\\nmeaning that you gotta restart the game every 3-6 games of ground, helicopters, and naval.\\nhow long has this problem existed now? i dont know the specific time but lets just say the last big patch did that, or maybe even the big patch before that. all of my friends who play wt experience the same memory leak issues btw.\\n\\nas you can see and like i described above, new bugs just start showing up, and this time gaijin doesnt even bother fixing something as critical as that.\\nhow unexpected.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]This is an extensive review of what to expect going into another Free-To-Play game and its business practices. This review is aimed for new players looking to get into the tank part of the game.[/h1]\\n\\n[i]Note : If you are interested in aircraft or ships, skip this one.[/i]\\n\\n\\nThe game is developed by a Russian company, Gaijin - they work with another company to make the vehicle models and other individuals and contributors to get real data/information on how they performed in real life and how to best represent that in-game.\\n\\n[b]The Positives Side : [/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The graphics are stunning. Very accurate models, world detail and the new Dagor 5.0 engine did wonders for the game and they\\'ve promised even more optimizations in the recent Russian stream. The overall feeling is quite good, although the warlike atmosphere (such as smoke clouding the skies) could be a bit better. \\n[*] UK, USA, Russia, Germany, France, Japan and soon Italy will be participating in ground battles. Each nation with their own playstyle, shells, armor layouts making for a refreshing experience.\\n[*] Accurate ballistics and armor composition make for a tactical tank combat that requires knowledge before player skill. In-game stat cards give an overall idea of what the tank is capable of, how much punching power it has and what type of it can deal with. It\\'s quite a steep learning curve for the first hundred hours and even by then you\\'ll still have questions about how to deal with certain targets and what to look for. [i]Hint : Look for answers on youtube and reddit, not in-game.[/i] Rome wasn\\'t built in a day and you will certainly not understand War Thunder\\'s mechanics early on. \\n[*] The tank models are really well made. I mentioned this before and I would like to emphasize on the \"weight\" of the tank compared to Wargaming\\'s World of Tanks. You can really feel like you\\'re driving a tank and not Mario Kart. The pacing is slow in two game modes, and a bit quicker in the other one (more below).\\n[*] The sounds are excellent. From 12.7mm Anti-Air guns, to big 150mm Sturmpanzer cannon - deeper, realistic and satisfying shell sounds are what help with immersion when playing this game. \\n[*] Three game modes to please every tank player - Arcade, Realistic, Simulator. All have their differences ranging from engine power (with Simulator being the closest to real values and arcade having extra power) to aiming assistance. \\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] The Negative :[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Gaijin has to be one of the worst offenders in gaming history. If you have an extensive gaming experience you are already thinking of Nexon, Trion, EA, and half of the developers in the MMORPG market. The one thing they do not have compared to Gaijin is the [b]grip on a niche audience[/b]. You see, there\\'s no competitor to War Thunder in the entire gaming industry. World of Tanks and Armored Warfare target a different audience - one that likes arcade style hitpoints, peak-a-boo style of tank play. The audience of War Thunder is completely different. You have community members who spend an absurd amount of time finding documents, conducting research unlike in any other community you\\'ll ever see. Because there\\'s no competitor on the market for a realistic war game with tanks and aircraft/ships, [b]they own this entire audience and they know it[/b]. This company has pulled of unprecedented levels of unprofessionalism and lack of communication with the playerbase that would\\'ve grounded [b]ANY[/b] company including the owner of this store you\\'re reading this review on. Constant lies, fabricated \"sources\" and documents, selective feedback. I could go on forever here, but EA has that stigma because it was Star Wars and that hurts Americans, not because they\\'re worse than Gaijin.\\n[*] Infurating matchmaker - The matchmaker is set to +- 1 battle rating. What this means is that having your best tank a 3.7 Sherman you will at worst be matched with players that have either a 4.7 vehicle as their best, or at best with players who have a 2.7 tank as top. In lower tiers this is not really an issue, you will learn and adapt to a different playstyle. However as you move up into late World War 2 vehicles where armor really matters and further into Cold War T-54s the matchmaker becomes such a problem to the point of frustration. Depending on the game, your best tank will not be able to penetrate frontally any of the enemy teams excluding cupolas and machine gun ports (if they have one). The community has been asking for a +- 0.7 battle rating matchmaker for [b]YEARS[/b], but they haven\\'t listened and never will. Good luck fighting an American T29 heavy tank hull down on your Panther D, you will never win.\\n[*] When you get a new tank, you get a stock performance which can be further improved by researching modules such as \"Engine\", which gives a better acceleration, \"Brakes\" that help you break quicker and allow for quick retreating if you\\'re caught off-guard and many others. Among these modules you have two culprits where one of the shittiest player frustration mechanic in the game is - \"Parts\" and \"Fire Prevention Equipment\". Without the first one, you cannot repair your tank, unless you\\'re sitting on your objective. If you take a shot and your gun breech is damaged, you\\'re out of combat for the rest of the game, since shooting with a broken gun breech will detonate the shell inside your own tank. If you take a shot to your transmission you\\'ll be stationary the rest of the game. If a similar situation happens 20 seconds into the game...you can see how fun that might be. The best is FPE - if you get shot in your engine or fuel tanks, you\\'ll be set on fire. You guessed it, without this module you\\'ll continue burning until you\\'re dead. The removal of these two modules has been asked since closed beta - Gaijin refused.\\n[*] Community management - No developer reads the international forum in English. Instead there are moderators who \"forward\" suggestions to them for review. This is fine, they\\'re not required to know English, it\\'s an absurd request. The moderators on the other hand are absolute morons and worthless human beings on a power trip. If they do not like your suggestion your post will never appear. Your communication with the developer is entirely gone because no one heard it - not your fellow players who could upvote that or give feedback to you on how to improve it, or why your idea is totally wrong and you should come back with a better one. Radio silence, it\\'s gone. They shut down opinions they do not like or that highlight the Russian favoritism that is present in game (there\\'s plenty of evidence of this, ask me below if you want) and ban everyone that talks back. Truly one of the worst forums out there.\\n[/list] \\n\\nSomething to note about the community in-game : I was a bit surprised coming from World of Tanks and it\\'s cesspool. Most games go without anyone talking other than radio commands \"Attack X\", \"Defend X\", \"Follow Me\" etc. Very rarely do you get dirtbags and flame wars, it\\'s surprising in a PvP game. Usually it\\'s someone venting in [ALL] about bias, rarely personal. They\\'re far more talkative in Simulator Tank Battles, really nice as well. Overall a decent community I would say, on reddit too if you ignore some of the usual internet types. \\n\\n[b] Final thought :[/b]\\n\\nThe game itself is excellent, there\\'s nothing like it which is why I\\'ve played it for so long. It\\'s interesting, you also tend to learn things you never knew just by playing and talking to other community members - tanks, the war, other projects, prototypes and so on. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone however. The further you go, the sadder you\\'ll feel about what a company like Grinding Gear, Digital Extremes or Obsidian could\\'ve done with this. This is the best war game on the Steam store, made by the worst company.',\n",

       "  'review': 'would be the best online tank/plane game there is IF, Gaijin wasn\\'t as greedy as they are. They\\'ve become increasingly money hunrgy, and have now launched their own \"market\" where you can buy tanks/plane, that were preaviously only available if you put in a lot of time to do a challenge in a specific time.\\n\\nnow however they offer their own \"lootboxes\" where you can get these vhicles and just sell them on their own market (which uses their own curency ofcourse, that you can\\'t turn into real life cash). The people that originaly went through the effort of getting these vheicles then get nothing but a big middle finger in return. Because they know long time players wont leave (atleast not completely, mabye just a break for a few months) because there\\'s no other game out there like it.\\n\\ni just hate to see a game i\\'ve played so much slowly go down the shitter, just for some easy cash instead of fixing big issues that have been there for the start. Instead of fixing the gameplay or adding more stuff to do, like new game modes, They just add more tanks/planes... ect. because that\\'s how they get some easy cash.\\n\\nalso they may have added helicopters and boats, but you gotta PAY TO TEST THEM FOR GAIJIN. Boats should have been releaced a year or two ago, but no, they know that if they keep it in \"closed beta\" they\\'ll earn way more money off it, because then the people who love the game and have seen most of what it has already, will have to buy a 40$ hellicopter/boat instead of just playing the regualr old cluster fuck that is tank or air realisitc battles. so now both boats and planes are in beta, and probably will be for another century..\\n\\n\\nI just rambled through this entire review, but i really care for the game and the community, but the devs are as shady as you get, one of the tips they give new players is \"spend some cash\"',\n",

I understand that I have many an hour in this game, however the last 1000 hours have largely been of the same line ups with no noticeable progress in research. this game will leave you bitter and unwilling to do what is actually fun.

       "  'review': 'Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for \" Unauthorized use of software\" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I\\'ve never cheated & I wouldn\\'t even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.\\n\\n11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven\\'t laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on battle.net which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it\\'s the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can\\'t even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the battle.net servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven\\'t played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download battle.net and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially  cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I\\'m back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren\\'t cheaters and didn\\'t do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won\\'t take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can\\'t tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I pay 70$ and almost 100 hours into the game everything is fine and dandy no issues, just having fun, but when I start getting a little \"good\", I get banned for absolutely no reason at all. \"Unauthorized software\" and \"Data Manipulation\" I\\'ve never cheated on a steam game and I don\\'t even know how. I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It\\'s not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response, can\\'t even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also it\\'s not just me who encountered this issue, it\\'s multiple people, they don\\'t get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can\\'t even get a refund so I\\'m stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn\\'t care about their regular players, because there\\'s over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I\\'ve heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it\\'s ridiculous.\\n\\n\\nUpdate 1/7/2023 If you crash don\\'t click \"Verify game files\" it will flag you for data manipulation and you will get permanently banned. The games been out almost half a year and activision hasn\\'t brought this up or even hinted.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit (Part 1/2):\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.\\n\\nHowever, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.\\n\\nI will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.\\n\\nI truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.\\n\\nThere is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.\\n\\nI\\'m praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does\\'t rain too much he\\'ll down on the game when the DLC is to release.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit (Part 2/2):\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don\\'t get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n\\n\\nSkill Based Match Making - Since I hadn\\'t played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.\\n\\nCo-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy\\'s Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.\\n\\nThe maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don\\'t feel like Call of Duty maps. I don\\'t know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don\\'t really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty\\'s maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There\\'s just no middle ground.\\n\\nGame modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.\\n\\nGunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.\\n\\nUI - I\\'m not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.\\n\\nPerks - I don\\'t mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion: \\n\\n\\n\\nThere are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don\\'t put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did. \\n\\nThese other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they\\'ll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don\\'t, it wouldn\\'t be a surprise at all.\\n\\nThere has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it\\'s not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty\\'s on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.\\n\\nHowever, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.\\n\\n\\n\\n(You may find my original review below for the lols)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn\\'t mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.\\n\\nAs I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.\\n\\nI felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.\\n\\nThe main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year. \\n\\nI feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.\\n\\nWell... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing \"even better Call of Duty\\'s\" and \"bringing the franchise to new heights\"\\n\\nSo here is my message to the franchise for this decision:\\n\\nFuck you.\\n\\nAnd to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.\\n\\nThe UI is still bad but my game functions, it\\'s still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don\\'t care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I\\'m choosing when it\\'s either on the gun or just a playlist.\\n\\nMTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it\\'s still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.\\n\\nDMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.\\n\\nWarzone is Warzone lol.\\n\\nSpec Ops does get updated, and that\\'s good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There\\'s a blueprint tied to it I haven\\'t grinded for, but there\\'s a \"weekly\" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven\\'t gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.\\n \\nCore MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you\\'ll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision\\'s attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the \"de facto\" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don\\'t know how to put my finger on it but it\\'s a good \\'turn the brain off\\' game, but it\\'s not something I\\'d consider amazing?\\n\\nCampaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there\\'s not a spectacular amount that\\'s memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It\\'s a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a \\'tutorial\\' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there\\'s going to be a third game and they\\'ll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.\\n\\nDo I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it\\'s on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it\\'s slower than most \\'modern\\' CoDs (2019~Vanguard). \\n\\nI like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It\\'s alright. I wouldn\\'t switch to a full recommend because it\\'s still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.\\n\\ntl;dr\\n\\nits mid but its brain popcorn. it\\'s just brain popcorn that\\'s too expensive.\\n\\nI also can\\'t switch the thumb or it\\'s going to wipe ratings, and I\\'m not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After 600 hours of this game, playing multiplayer and DMZ, I cannot for the life of me recommend this game. Multiplayer is so tampered with on activisions part is unreal, leading to every match being all calculated either against or for you due to how matchmaking works. I didn't mind the skill based of the old games, but if activision decides you are doing too well, you are going to encounter the best players beyond your skill level, letting the next matches be essentially you dying over and over until your skill level drops and they match you against the most braindead players. You play game, you get punished, whether you are controller player or not. Don't get me wrong, pub stomps are boring, I like a equal match, what isn't a equal match is forcing me into the highest brackets of players because I do too positive and forcing me to have a bad time because their system is worse than most sbmm's I have ever seen in my entire life. This isn't even going on to touch on DMZ, on how their bots are either going to be the most blind, inaccurate computers you have ever seen, or each one is an exact clone copy of john wick, who is able to shoot you through the wall and glitch out very frequently, to which I'm not sure if thats even affected by anything or just IWs awful coding. DMZ is fun with friends, but a miserable experience when it decides that it will punish you for dare having fun, a vicious cycle of them rewarding you and taunting you back into the game and then beating the hell out of you so you're back to ground zero. \\nThis isn't even going on to how this game performs on most systems, which cannot be argued that it's pretty close to shit. It crashes for many people months after launch, bugs plague the menus, and by god the UI on the menu is horrendous, some of these issues which have retained since launch. I've been very generous with my patience, wishing that they would patch these, but I'm a fool for thinking someone like activison would worry about patching actual issues, rather than going for anything that results in benefiting the player more than Mr.John Activision would wish (I.E Exp glitches, Cosmetic glitches etc...). We all already know about the aim assist too, and the arguments that follow it so I won't even touch that demon, you want to know more, search it up yourself and I really insist you do.\\nI can say positively, that the guns feel good(the m13 and kastvov 545 suck though), and the variety is nice, until you realize 99% of attachments actually don't matter unless you're doing a funny niche build, which most have a punishment of killing your ADS in a game where ADS is the prime component of winning your duels, unless you have already pre-aimed. This game is so against the players, but at the same time keeps you in by giving you matches to you for free, drip feeding you to keep your retention in, rather than making a genuine fun game like the COD games used to be, just a simple shooter that can be played when you get home and not have to stress about the silly issues that plague new releases, and with a publisher and developer that ignore and probably hate their community. Even Halo Infinite, a game which has been plagued with issues since its release, their company listens to their users far better than this company (although that isn't a high bar anyways).\\nI went in with hope, and came out with cope, I cannot find long term enjoyment in this game, and maybe that's just me getting older, maybe FPS games are just not for me anymore, maybe this game taught me to go in the woods and be a monkey, whatever the end result, this game has sealed it for me that I will not be playing another CoD title after this, or at the most I will look upon the next ones with extreme scrutiny and criticism as I should have done before. I hope whoever reads this review can make a second opinion on this game, and whoever has already bought it I hope that you can find more enjoyment in this game than I have.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\\n\\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\\n\\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\\n    [*]Weapon tuning\\n    [*]Al Mazrah\\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\\n    [*]Proximity chat\\n    [*]3rd person modes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\\n    [*]Movement\\n    [*]UI\\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\\n    [*]The price\\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd the list goes on.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\\n\\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\\n\\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\\n\\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\\n\\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\\n\\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\\n\\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\\n\\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\\n\\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \\n\\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\\n\\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\\n\\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\\n[/list]\\n\\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\\n\\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....\\n\\nHere is what I have experienced so far:\\n\\n1. If you\\'re good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big \"HOW?\"\\n\\n2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn\\'t register so you have to relaunch the game.\\n\\n3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).\\n\\n4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).\\n\\n5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don\\'t play any different here.\\n\\nOverall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would\\'ve had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you\\'re considering buying this game, don\\'t do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can\\'t let $70 go to waste.\\n\\nEDIT: Steam told me I played an additional 11 hours and asked me to revise my review. Here\\'s my revision, still sucks\\n\\nEdit: allowing comments, but only if you\\'re a COD MWII hater just like me',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards \"casuals\", nor \"the OGs\" of the COD community [/h1]\\n\\nBefore I get into the title and explain why you shouldn\\'t bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it\\'s kind, I\\'m going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don\\'t.\\n\\n[u] What I like [/u]\\nI) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn\\'t on the AK, when converting it to 5.45.\\nII) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn\\'t worth it since it didn\\'t make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should\\'ve done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy\\'s spawn, not punished for it.\\n\\n[u] What I dislike [/u]\\nI) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later.\\n•Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing.\\n•Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the \"immersion\" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly.\\n•The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It\\'s like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a \"brand new game\".\\n•Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect.\\n•The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter\\'s shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of \"realism\" to normies who think they\\'ve become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive.\\n•Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll.\\nII) You might be thinking \"Woah, that\\'s a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn\\'t have messed up worse this time?\". If that\\'s what\\'s on your mind, you\\'d be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves.\\n•The UI is some of the worse I\\'ve ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn\\'t work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it\\'d be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what\\'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is?\\n•There is this new \"ledge hang\" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It\\'s also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you.\\n•On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn\\'t like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max [b] every weapon level for every gun to unlock all the attachments for a single gun. [/b] MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it\\'s not even remotely the case.\\n\\n[h1] So, going back to the title I chose, who is this game targeted towards? [/h1]\\n\\n[u] Is it targeted towards the \"OGs\"? [/u] \\nOf course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The \"OGs\" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the \"red dots\" on the minimap and the perk \"dead silence\", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.\\n\\n[u] So, is MWII2022 targeted towards \"casuals\"? [/u] \\nAgain, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don\\'t have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new \"receiver\" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.\\n\\n[u] So what is it? Who are they catering to? [/u]\\n[b] This is just my take, but to me, it\\'s quite obvious. They are catering to whales. A small minority of neglected children and adult toddlers with too much spare time and money on their hands, who\\'s entire life revolves around watching pixels on a screen change colors. This is the purpose of all these recent AAA business practices (grindy battle passes and challenges, \"cosmetic microtransactions\", hidden matchmaking algorithms etc.), to turn you into a loser who wastes their time helping the publisher brag about \"player retention\" to their investors, and their money buying grossly overpriced digital outfits and camos just to feel something new, because the gameplay itself is not enough to give you any kind of fulfillment. DO NOT GIVE IN, and if you have kids, don\\'t let them play modern online AAA games, because they are designed to get gullible people (which every child is) hooked and detached from reality. Don\\'t waste your life on games that take your time for granted. Do you want to achieve something noteworthy in your life, or do you want to throw it all away for some greedy billionaire? It\\'s your choice, but believe me, there isn\\'t time for both. [/b]\\n\\n Thank you for reading my review. I don\\'t do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Not worth it. At all. [/h1]\\n\\nEver since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You\\'re simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.\\n\\nSkill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I\\'m playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it\\'s the same scenario since the game got released. \\n\\nAlso, if there is a \"ranked\" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn\\'t the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?\\n\\nExtra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I\\'m getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?\\n\\nFor some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don\\'t know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can\\'t emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can\\'t bother calling it aim assist anymore, it\\'s Aimbot. For real it\\'s aimbot. You\\'ll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you\\'re slightly next to their crosshair, you\\'re done. They don\\'t even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there\\'s no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.\\n\\nI get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they\\'re using just their thumbs to aim, but I don\\'t want to be a part of this. I don\\'t want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he\\'ll be able to get kills. It\\'s simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it\\'s not possible? Isn\\'t the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & Battle.net combo?\\n\\nSome TL:DR for you:\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n- Good Gunplay\\n- Good Animations\\n- Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons\\n- Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock\\n- AMD\\'s FSR works pretty well\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n- SBMM\\n- No Crossplay opt-out choice\\n- Inconsistent footsteps & audio\\n- No Stopping Power as a perk\\n- No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk\\n- Matches feel rigged\\n\\nEdited for spelling errors.',\n",

But if you are a fan of the \"golden age\" of cod its time to stop buying these new CoD games, it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games. Take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one, they are pandering to us (the old guard of CoD haha) and will continue to push this disgusting micro-transaction/live service model of modern gaming. You probably don\\'t need me to tell you it ain\\'t like it used to be.\\n\\nCampaign was fine, some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy.\\nMultiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but TTK is fast, possibly fastest we have seen.\\nGraphics are great! Feels like it runs better than previous new CoDs.\\nRegardless its more of the same safe new CoD that you probably either already love or hate. If I could give this a score out of 10 I would probably say 7/10 but it would score higher if there weren\\'t so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers, but loses points for predatory marketing practices. \\nWhy did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous CoDs?\\nOn the chance that you are new to CoD and have not purchased one before, don\\'t start here, and avoid giving this company your money.\\n\\nProbably gonna keep playing but that\\'s only really because of Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 flopping hard, yay modern AAA gaming.',\n",

Only 12 maps with 2 reused from previous CODs\\n7. Maps are either too big or too small\\n8. No Gun fight\\n9. No Infected or Zombies mode\\n10. No night time variants of maps with NVG\\n11.

       "  'review': 'This probably the most well made piece of garbage that has ever been put out. First lets talk about the obvious one.... the hacking is off the charts, the number of times I\\'ve been tracked through walls is amazing, and if its not that its some player with the aim of a god (cronus zen and other aim assist mods that the \"anticheat\" doesn\\'t do anything about). And the reason they don\\'t do anything about it is because so many of the streamers are cheating but COD cant afford to loose the streamers. Next, is the spawning... how does a game developer make the exact same type of game decade after decade and still cant figure out how to spawn people, you will spawn directly in front of enemies, you spawn behind a teammate that is already being shot at , you\\'ll spawn in the middle of the enemy team and get melted immediately or wipe out their whole team from behind, and if you don\\'t get those spawns you get the complete opposite and the game spawns you 5 miles away from anyone. Not only that but the game seems to do it on purpose, its been a common theme that once you start doing well in a game all of the sudden you start spawning in random spots and messes up the whole flow and allows the other team to take over areas they weren\\'t able to before hand. On another note the game really seems to nerf in real time. It is common to hear about and experience yourself, once you start doing well in a game mode or even mid game it seems to start taking more shots to kill people, footsteps seems to get softer, you start dying to less shots, it just seems fishy. The weapons are a whole other issue, they are so unbalanced its crazy. Getting two shot\\'d (often one shot) by pistols but yet my .308 that leaves a baseball sized hole in your chest doesnt kill because \"iTs NoT a HeAdShOt\". Not to mention, what is the point of having three different sniper (high caliber) rifle classes if all of them are going to be mobile and easy to use, why is a full size 338  easier to handle than a spr even with both having the short barrels? Lets move onto sound. I don\\'t have the best headset around (arctis pro 7+) but they are pretty decent for my standards. Footsteps in this game are horrendous, you can barely hear yourself think due to your own footsteps but enemy footsteps are so quiet you cant even hear them, the game even makes your teammates loud, you can hear your teammate on the second floor 6 rooms down better than you can hear an enemy coming through the doorway 3 meters to your side. The only mode that its not an issue is S&D and even then the sounds don\\'t seem accurate, for example the map that you can swim has really loud boards when you run, i cant count how many times ive been on that map and been like \"oh that guy is still on the boards\" so i pop out to catch him but when i pop out the dude is like 5 meters down the concrete slab and already pulled up on me. lets move on to performance, I have never had an issue running games on this PC but this game eats my GPU, i mean constant 98% utilization... NFS heat doesn\\'t even get that high. Not only that but the game constantly crashes. Want to edit your class mid game? To bad you\\'re going to have to force close the game then boot it back up again. Want to go through the store or battle pass while waiting in a lobby? Too bad, restart the game. Want to lag with 25 latency? Well you are in luck! Next the leveling up. I have never played a game where you basically needed double xp tokens to rank up quickly at all. For example yesterday i had three games in a row where i got 30+ kills, anyone wanna guess how many times my weapons and soldier ranked up in that 90+ kill span? Well my Orbiter went from lvl 3 to 5, my revolver went up a half of a level, and i progressed one xp level as a whole... I mean come on, what a joke. The game is all around pretty bad, usually i don\\'t leave reviews but after paying $100 for this game i really feel robbed. If you are a toxic chad that plays literally nothing else but COD this game is perfect for you.',\n",

Anyway here's a lemon pie recipe:\\n\\nGraham Cracker Crust:\\n1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs\\n1/4 cup granulated white sugar\\n6 tbsp melted butter\\n\\nLemon Filling:\\n2 x 14-oz cans sweetened condensed milk\\n1 cup fresh lemon juice\\n6 egg yolks\\n2 tbsp finely grated lemon zest\\n\\nMethod:\\n-Preheat oven to 350°F / 180°C\\n-Mix the crust. Add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter into a mixing bowl and stir until well combined.\\n-Transfer the crumb mixture into a 9-in / 23 cm deep-dish pie pan. Press the crumbs tightly into the bottom and up the sides of the pie dish. Set aside.\\n-Mix filling. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a large mixing bowl and add the egg yolks and lemon zest. Whisk to combine. Add the lemon juice and whisk vigorously until well combined and you no longer see any juice. The lemon juice will thicken the condensed milk.\\n-Bake. Pour the lemon filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. The lemon pie is done when the edges are set and only slightly jiggly in the centre.\\n-Cool & refrigerate. Remove the pie from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate until firm for at least 3 hours before serving.\\n-Garnish. Decorate the pie as desired. I dressed up my pie with puffs of whipped cream, lemon slices, a sprinkle of lemon zest, and sliced almonds.\\n-Serve. Slice the pie into 10 to 12 pieces and serve cold. Enjoy!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[b] Yes, I recommend this, but changes need to be made [/b]\\nStarting off with the positives:\\n1. This game is gorgeous, the atmosphere, weapons, animations, and characters are on another level\\n2. The gunplay is fantastic. Everything feels very real, and the guns are fun to use\\n3. The campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original MW2.\\n4. The multiplayer, WHEN BALANCED, is a lot of fun to play\\nHOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this game.\\n1. Breaking up lobbies to readjust for SBMM not only penalizes the player for playing well, it also doesn't give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older CODs.\\n2. The aim assist on the controller is mind numbing. The fact that I switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign.\\n3. The main menu/UI in this game has to be the worst I have ever seen.\\n4. Weapon balancing is desperately needed.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend because the problems with the game can be solved and I see at least a couple of them being resolved in the next few patches. But jfc, it needs work.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'this is a reveiw literally the second day after the games full release, ill be sure to change it as they improve and update the game.\\n\\n(THERE WILL BE SPOILERS FOR THE CAMPAIGN)\\n\\nfirst, the game currently is a 3/5\\nthe campaign is fantastic, lots of variety and levels that really suck you in as you pull covert operations or go guns blazing in crazy gunfights. a bit disappointing that Farah is mentioned for one level, Hadir or Alex are never mentioned or seen, questions and concerns from the first game arent really addressed in this game. but overall it was a wonderful experience.\\n\\n\\nthe multiplayer\\n\\nas of posting this 10/29/2022\\n\\nthe multi is good, most of the maps on release are actually not bad at all, i really like the racewway and border checkpoint maps. the guns feel good, look good, even pistols got a bit of love in terms of firepower and range which is nice. all of the base ops are unlockable via challenges and theres a great amount of them, providing players some personal customization which is great if some really dont want to spend the money of characters when theyre all just cosmetic.\\ni also really really like how camos are done know, with each gun having four camos which, when unlocked through a much simpler camo challenge, are unlocked for all guns. no longer having to grind every gun out for the same camos over and over and over doing mundane repetitive and sometimes frustrating challenges just to reach the mastery camos.\\n\\none of the biggest problems however is currently the game is having a bit of a glitchy release.\\n1. the game is very prone to crashing, i think if youre graphics settings cant meet a requirement sometimes the game just kills itself and i have to sit for up to 10 minutes just waiting for steam to verify the game files for the umpteenth time.\\n2. Camos are glitching out, i spent all day grinding out the camo challenges excitedly to get the gold camo for the m4, just to see that i am unable to select any of the mastery camos to see if ive unlocked the gold camo challenge\\n3. the voice channels is a VERY GOOD idea, it allows friends playing through crossplay to talk and play together in  game so that all parties can still hear the game since things like discord and skype or pc and phone only, problems is its broken, there were so many times where we kept getting muted after loading into match no matter how we set our vc preference, we couldnt hear one person but he could hear us, and i was hoping that the vc would be prioritized whether you were loading in, or in a match while your friend wasnt. he has a ps4 so takes a bit longer to load in, but i cant hear or talk to him until hes loading into the match.\\n4. there is a SEVERE lack of content. im unsure if maybe IW is waiting until season one before releasing a bunch of content but we are missing quite a bit compared to the beta. executions that were seen from most operators in the beta have been removed so that everyone all has the same one, i unlocked the beta skin for horangi, but am unable to access his base skin so far it seems only the milsim ops have customizable skins. there was alot of hype and speculation that a few popular guns such as the honey badger was going to be added to the game, but its not there, think it was even usable in the campaign but i may have been confused. but its likely they removed it from the start of the game to use it as a season 1 weapon. \\n\\nso far the game is good, but not great, its prone to bugs and glitches and breaks and needs a bit more post release polish, which i think we all hope to see within the coming weeks, and hopefully not having to wait for fixes until Nov 16th. \\n\\nsorry for the awful review this is my first time writing a legitimate one and i had pretty much know clue how to convey everything clear and concise. tell me im stupid if it helps',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m going to split my review of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II into a single-player and multiplayer section. I\\'ll start with the campaign:\\n\\nThe campaign was an enjoyable filler experience (emphasis on filler) for me and nothing more than that - I felt like at times the campaign went from awesome to cringe, awesome to cringe, over and over again. Some of the missions were super cool (e.g: \"Recon By Fire\"), whilst others were quite cringe (e.g \"Violence And Timing\", this mission especially felt like something taken out of a Bollywood film - felt quite unnatural and out of place to be honest). This year there was clearly a heavy emphasis on stealth like missions, which personally fell in good taste, but some might dislike that. \"Alone\" on the hardest difficulty and doing the achievement that requires you to not fire a gun was one of the toughest challenges I have had in a long time. \\n\\nThe biggest selling point for me must be the sheer attention to detail in things like level design (the Amsterdam level is absolutely gorgeous), gun animations, etc, and my personal favourite, the sound design. The sound of the guns, impact of the grenades, flash-bangs, in this game is truly art. The guns and explosives genuinely feel powerful and effective - compared to other years where they might sound more \"toy\" like. TL;DR: Decent campaign at best, nothing mesmerising that will stick with you, forgettable but good filler experience. A good bonus to the multiplayer.\\n\\nIt is worth adding that the game ran beautifully on my 3070/i5-11400 PC and throughout a 7.5 hour campaign, I experienced around 3 crashes, which in my eyes is not that bad - given how games are these days \"just\" 3 crashes is considered polished. \\n\\nNow, for the part everyone really buys Call of Duty for... the multiplayer: \\n\\nAs far as level design goes, I am on the fence. Some of the maps are quite good like Al Bagra Fortress, Farm 18 and El Asilo, where others leave more to be desired. Visually speaking they are all gorgeous to look at, but some of them play horribly and I am not a fan personally, though this is of course subjective. Honestly, there is not much to say about the multiplayer aspect of the game as of right now - if you enjoyed Modern Warfare 2019 you will most likely enjoy this game too and get a good few hours of fun from this game.',\n",

All hitmarkers\" and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of fucking times it just erases my existence? \\n\\nI just cannot have fun on here. Even as a team anymore. With the SBMM and EOMM, I get punished immediately if I do slightly good in a match, by being thrown in matches with people that just shit on me the entire time. \\nPeople complain that movement is slow and terrible, but it\\'s not. If it was, then explain why sliding and shooting around corners, or jumping and shooting is the strategy. Movement is still super fast and fucking stupid just like before.\\nShields and knives are near impossible to counter. Their feet are covered, can\\'t flank because they will rush and kill you. Can\\'t throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you. Thanks.\\nAll I want is to jump into matches and have fun. No, not just stomp everyone, that\\'s not fun. I want to have fun. I want varied lobbies, showing that people aren\\'t just bots. It doesn\\'t help that the aim assist actually tracks for you, with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not. If your aim starts to move on it\\'s own, you just aim and fire and you\\'re gonna get the kill. I position myself better and shoot first? Doesn\\'t matter. Enemy moves around, causing me to have to MANUALLY track them with my mouse and eyes, while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake. While they can just slightly tilt R stick down and fire. Flinch? Damn right that I do but when you have aim assist, the tracking pretty much counters it. There\\'s nothing fun about it. I am only playing it for fear of missing out, and since I already bought the damn thing. The campaign was fun but that alone isn\\'t worth what I paid.\\nI am not ok, and this game is making shit worse. It is infuriating, by design. I can\\'t even get good games anymore. What is the new \"good\" for me is if I am close to breaking even. Before I could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where I actually do good. Now it\\'s just getting wrecked at spawn, or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has UAV that works through Ghost. Or, I shoot someone first, hit them twice, and they snap and melt me with their braindead controller aim assist.',\n",

I work 9 hours a day and I would like to just relax and enjoy the game but god forbid i get 1.10 KD and I'm off into the lobby of tryhard 13 year olds who havnt showered since release. I am really tired of this garbage that comes out. I cant even play this game with my girlfriend. had she been in my lobbies she cant even play. Just an unfun experience really. not every game needs to be extremely tryhard. I miss being able to play the game with good players AND bad players. also there is way too many cheesy builds to run. already seeing at least 1 shield knife runner every other game. For $70 and only MP to play with a 5 hour campaign, this game is not worth that much.\",\n",

The website they provided to me was down and no way to access. They were kind enough to refund the game. \\n\\nBut the game I did play was fun, the community was the same exact way I left it back when Modern Warfare 2 was first on the XBOX 360. The guns feel great to use, and customization isn't a drag to deal with. I never did get to play the campaign so i cannot with good heart recommend. I hope you all find some kind of enjoyment from the game.\\n\\nP.S to prevent being banned, All i saw online is try to not tab out. Or verify game files. Or else you will be banned\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I have been playing The King of Fighters since 1995, starting with KOF94, when I was a kid in the arcades in Mexico, and at the local corner marts. I\\'ve seen this game evolve over several years and improve with each iteration, sometimes taking steps forward and sometimes taking steps back. As time has passed and I\\'ve gotten older, I find that the fighting game series that I will always truly love is KOF. Games like Capcom VS SNK 2 or Tekken 7 may individually be some of my favorite games, but my heart is always with KOF.\\n\\nThat said, my interest in the series as a whole simply waned quite a bit in recent years. KOF XIV, while a fun entry early on, simply didn\\'t manage to hold my attention through its full competitive lifespan. KOF 2002 UM was a fun diversion, but the style of its gameplay was never my scene. KOF 98, my previous absolute favorite, felt a little too different in ways I didn\\'t like when it became KOF 98 UM. Ultimately, I waited for the release of KOF XV with some trepidation. That said, the betas for XV really did help alleviate many of my fears: the characters moved well! The netcode was a little strange but was basically fixed entirely during the second beta. The gameplay was simply exactly what I expected out of KOF, and my excitement began to swell.\\n\\nUpon release, I can say this with absolute certainty, in a way that I am sure will get me the derision of some of my peers, but I have to shout it from the rooftops: KOF XV is my favorite KOF game of all time.\\n\\nIt certainly is my favorite aesthetically, even despite its shortcomings (the VFX can go from \"pretty OK\", such as Iori\\'s fireballs, Kyo\\'s Orochinagi flare, and the effects on Isla\\'s hands... to \"this is the ugliest thing I\\'ve ever seen\"—the block sparks are super ugly and several fireballs just look hideous, like Ryo\\'s and Robert\\'s). The UI is incredible to look at. All the features, like being able to select oldschool KOF tracks to listen to while you play, feel awesome. The soundtrack fits the theme of the game very well. I will never REALLY be that into Max Powers as an announcer, but he\\'s growing on me (much to my chagrin, not gonna lie; he\\'s so goddamn extra). The character models are such a huge improvement over XIV and the game has sort of established its own visual style that I just really do find appealing. Just... it\\'s a good-looking game, hell. It\\'s definitely a PS4-era game in terms of looks, sure. But it looks great within that context, and that\\'s what I love.\\n\\nAs for how it functions? Let\\'s break it down.\\n\\n- You will hear this a lot: the game plays as though they took the good lessons from KOF XIV and applied them, while fixing all of the pitfalls from that game. Gone is 2B 2B 2B into MAX activate for every situation.\\n- The game moves like you expect KOF to; if you\\'re a veteran, it will be a tiny adjustment.\\n- The lobby system is incredible, with rotating lines, automatic spectating, and the ability to change a bunch of settings mid-spectating.\\n- The matchmaking is a little suspect, but it works well enough and is a few fixes away from being perfect; it may need some automatic firewall assistance though!\\n- The online play feels amazing, although some matches feel a little rough if people are playing on older PCs and don\\'t use mods to fix the issues (I suggest a \"Potato\" mod if your computer isn\\'t too hot).\\n- This is the easiest KOF has ever been to get into, without feeling like it\\'s surrendering too much of its own style to accomodate newer players. \\n- The UI is fairly responsive, but they kinda went overboard with the animations of everything adding a bunch of friction to what should be a fast few button presses to get somewhere. Closing the pause menu shouldn\\'t take as long as it does, for instance.\\n- The move list could stand to have more information (like super cancel information), but it is rather informative.\\n- The tutorial could stand to have some improvements: KOF plays a very specific way and it would be a lot better to be able to direct people to a good, functional tutorial instead of relying on, say, Dandy J to bear the brunt of educating newer players. Still, it\\'s pretty solid for what it is and covers the very bare necessities to learn KOF.\\n- The training UI features, such as the Frame ++/+/=/-/-- indicators in training are excellent, as is the frame-counted input system.\\n- The auto-recorded match replays are an awesome feature and will be helpful to players leveling up, and for people looking to create game content.\\n\\nSome nerdier nitty gritty stuff:\\n\\n- The PC version has the least input lag of all the versions at an average of 2.5 frames of input delay, if you care. The next best would be the Series X version, followed by the PS4 version played on a PS5.\\n- The PC version doesn\\'t have an option to disable VSync. Look up online how to turn it off! It involves a settings file. This honestly is best if you have a 144hz monitor with low input delay.\\n- The matchmaking in ranked works best if you\\'re sitting in a training lobby. The regionality indicator is less important than the connection quality setting. Leaving it at 3+ but letting any region or any rank fly is the best if you\\'re trying to play ranked to get better faster.\\n- Depending on your connection, you are probably fine playing against people with up to 150ms ping so long as they\\'re wired. Experiment with room lobbies to find your favorite.\\n\\nThis is the easiest fighting game recommend I have ever made in my life. KOF 2002 UM is perhaps the best of the classic remade versions of KOF. This is perhaps the best version of KOF, over all. I cannot recommend it highly enough. See you online!',\n",

       "  'review': \"One night, a friend of mine got drunk and bought the Deluxe edition for me and another friend of mine.\\nThis is a common trend for my friend and won't let me pay them back for the purchase, so hopefully this review will make it up to them.\\n\\nAny who, I love this game! Fighting games have become a recent love of mine, with Them's Fighting Herds and BlazBlue: Central Fiction only fueling that passion. While I don't understand most of the technical stuff about fighting games, and I'm honestly not the best at all, KOF XV is super fun, especially with my friends.\\n\\nThe KOF series, the lore and characters are incredibly intriguing to me, and they're alot of fun to see in action. The many character interactions are nice to see, and makes the characters feel more alive; that they have history and a world they've lived and experienced. It's great and I'm invested!\\n\\nThe one downside that I must bring up is, of course, the matchmaking. It's been bugged since it's inception (happy 100 days of bugged matchmaking!) and many are turned off from the game in it's entirety. From my experience, it does take a while to find other people, but it's fine for me. Plus, this issue isn't very relevant when you make an online room, and is the best way to play with your friends online. I understand that others will find it infuriating, and it's a huge problem that HAS to be fixed, but it hasn't hurt my experienced.\\nWhat HAS dampened my experience is the occasional crashes and freezes. I'm not sure if it's something with my PC, but I've gotten Unreal Engine crash logs every once in a while (one was from waiting in the training mode, another was from watching a story mode cutscene) and it's something that I want to know if others have experienced.\\n\\nOverall, I love this game! Fans of fighting games shouldn't miss out!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Compared to King of Fighters XIV, it is a step forward, and a step back. \\n\\nFor starters, the roster is not as big as it was in the King of Fighters XIV base game. Don't get me wrong though, this roster is still stacked, but they could have added a few more teams to keep in line XIV. As a result of this though, they omitted some series regulars such as Kim Kaphwan, Vice, Mature, and others. Kim probably being the biggest loss for me personally. That said though, 39 characters off the bat is nothing to frown at, considering in this day and age when most fighting games launch with rosters in the teens. Hell, some not even breaking double digits. \\n\\nVisually the game is a step in the right direction. To the untrained eye it might look similar to XIV, but there are some nice subtle changes to the character models such as improved physics affecting cloth movement, hair movement and more. There also appears to be much better animations for characters, and some changes to the way some faces look making characters seem more lively compared to their XIV counterparts. There is also now RTX support for reflections for cards that support it. \\n\\nthat said though the graphics don't come without some odd drawbacks. There is no VSync option built into the game, and the resolution options are limited when playing in fullscreen or windowed. You have to force your resolution by playing borderless windowed if your resolution is not listed. Only with borderless windowed mode was my 3440x1440 monitor able to display correctly. Of course being on an ultrawide monitor, there are pillarboxes, with the game displaying at 16:9 correctly. I'm a huge UW supporter, and I can safely say to all the other UW games out there, don't get mad. This is a fighting game. Full UW support without without pillarboxes would never make sense in this type of game. As for the the lack of vsync options, this has caused screen tearing for some players, which is never a good thing for a fighting game. This is something that could be fixed with the right monitor by forcing freesync/gsync, or enabling vsync in your GPU options. But not everyone is computer savvy, so this is a problem. Vsync should really be a built in option. \\n\\nI'll discuss the actual gameplay some more once I get more time with it, but so far it is very solid as expected. KoF has rarely let me down in this department. The only downside I'm seeing so far in terms of gameplay is that auto combos can not be disabled. It's not a deal breaker mind you since auto combos do not mean you are actually going to be a better player. Quite the opposite in fact. \\n\\nSo the question is, is it worth dropping $60usd on? If you're a KoF fan, the answer is undoubtedly yes. For general fighting game fans I'd still say yes for the sheer variety the roster gives you. For the casual gamer who is interested in getting into fighting games? Maybe wait for a sale. But definitely check it out.\",\n",

I have a total of 7 hours online with about 10 more offline. 17 hours total and only still in practice mode. Yup, not really a pick up and play sort of game. I will say this though, the game is very VERY fun. Even though it is not accessible to new players right off the bat, the time you spend in the training mode alone is well worth it. My advice to brand new FG (fighting game) players is practice makes perfect. The discord communities are very helpful and will teach you as you play. DO NOT get discouraged if you are getting slapped around by a CPU on easy. Pick a character that you like playing and stick with them. Continue to learn their \"Bread and Butter\" combos and you\\'ll be up there with the rest of the pros. This game is definitely about patience and honing your skill. Also, Mai is best waifu.',\n",

It\\'s so much fun, so many cool characters with awesome combos and supers.\\n\\nIn online Ranked Matchmaking, I no longer get matched up with the same person over and over. I set the rank level to \"Any\" and put the region to \"same region\". This will avoid matching up with guys with 250+ ping.  The matchmaking took about an average of 2 minute to find a match. The matches ran smooth as silk when the ping is around 100-150 ms.\\n\\nCasual Matchmaking is still not fixed. Also, if you live in a very remote location, then I can see matchmaking will still be a problem for you due to low player count, but with the added Crossplay next year, that should alleviate the problem to a certain degree.\\n\\nSpread the word and support this game (I just bought KOF 15\\'s Team 2 Pass and SamSho).

When I first tried to play pubs and spent around an hour searching for people just a couple of days after the official release, I started asking myself whether people had already stopped playing it or if they bought it on consoles. But this time, it turns out it has nothing to do with the player base or platform (since it happens across all of them). It's up to SNK to find out what's going on and do something about it - that is, if it's not already too late. \\n\\nI did enjoy the game, even though I'm not an enthusiast of the fighting genre. But being locked out of features with no fix in sight is frustrating, and it's killing what could've been a healthy player base.\",\n",

Game loads fast, no 5 minute load time just to start the game or in between matches like Tekken 7 / SFV\\n2. Trial (mission mode) isn't overly complicated, it simply provides you with the basics of the character but the depth is still there so you are free to discover more damaging combos\\n3. Netplay feels smooth\\n4. Basic movement and buttons are a lot faster and responsive compared to previous entries, no need to memorize long combo just to do damage\\n\\nOverall there is no significant flaw about this game, it's a good start and I hope SNK would treat it as a base game and build upon it in the future, not just a one-off thing. Fighting games these days in general lacks content outside of arcade mode and online matches, it's about time that the makers start catering to audiences that don't just sit in training mode all day.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'SNK IS FINALLY BACK.\\n\\nSNK has been floundering for so long. We\\'ve had the trash that was released in the PS2/Xbox era, and that lead into KOF XIII and XIV which in my opinion were very stale and lifeless compared to the originals. Finally entering the current era of games like Heroines which can only be described as crimes against an IP. \\n\\nGoing in, despite the nice trailers, I was very apprehensive. It\\'s been a long time since I\\'ve seen SNK really shine. Well, if you\\'re on the fence, get off of it, because this puts Capcom and frankly every other current fighting franchise dev to shame. \\n\\nIf you\\'re worried about 3D graphics vs the classic 2D sprites, worry not. Unlike the 3D in XIV, everything has soul and life. Animations are fluid and polished, the color palette is bright and vibrant, and humorous and skimpy outfits are offered off the bat without the need of expensive DLC to unlock them (COUGH: Capcom). Speaking of DLC, most of us are sick and tired of the crud Capcom is pulling with their Arcade/Champion/Super/Turbo crap piled onto endless DLC for literally everything under the sun. SFV Champion Edition is rated Mixed for a reason. KOF has never had this problem with multiple different versions for one game, and I don\\'t see that starting here. DLC will be for characters, and clothes will be included with those packs, as they should. The first DLC character pack is already astounding taking the already high amount of fighters (39) to 45 with an additional 6 characters, including fan favorites like Geese and long-gone stars like B. Jennet.\\n\\nBut how\\'s the fighting? Basically perfect! Control is spot on, characters are extremely varied and don\\'t feel like cheap model swaps like many fighting games (Smash Bros for example). Counters are well executed and feel so good to pull off, while special moves are allowed to be used at any power meter level, not forcing you to only use it once 100% full. Games are quick, fun, and old school laugh out loud/punch the guy on the sofa next to you, level of fun. \\n\\nI played with a buddy online tonight for over 3 hours. I legit have played every main fighting game release for the last decade, and this is the first time I\\'ve had as much fun as I did when I was a teen back in the PS1/Saturn era. This game is a serious competition title, but is jovial and lighthearted enough to not take itself too seriously. Music, character designs, move sets, backgrounds all keep you entertained and keep the convo and trash talk flowing to the point where it\\'s always \"just one more game\". My wife in the master bedroom a hallway down was surprised to hear me screaming and hollering so loud with the fun we had, as she\\'s never heard me so animated over a video game before.\\n\\nLong story short, it\\'s incredibly fun and refreshing. I feel rewarded for playing the game. This isn\\'t a comprehensive review, and I recognize that. Netcode is great btw, story mode is good enough ... it\\'s a story mode, and you have all the usual options. The new characters look kinda stupid but the girl with ghost hands and a spray painted getup is so freakin fun to use, that it keeps the game fresh. The guy named Dinosaur is our new \"wtf\" character, and his ability to produce some truly surprising move sets is great and keeps even seasoned vets on their toes.\\n\\nAll in all, it\\'s a truly great time. I honestly thought of SNK as the \"life support\" company, producing crappy arcade 1UP like machines and games like Heroines to keep the lights on, with zero respect for the characters they own or the IPs they reside in. But this game truly gives me not only hope, but genuine excitement for the future of SNK. It\\'s honestly like there\\'s an entirely new dev team at the helm here, and if that was true I really wouldn\\'t be surprised. It feels like a seasoned team of industry vets who were also huge fanboys of the originals were hired to make this game. That passion and soul comes off it\\'s practically dripping off the screen at every moment. \\n\\nSo, much to my surprise, I\\'d like to humbly thank SNK for this game, and the efforts done to not only do this well mechanically, but unlike the Samurai Shodown game that came out a couple years ago, to do this in a way that refreshes what was becoming a stale IP. I\\'m so glad to finally be proud again of SNK, and I wish them all the best in the near future. \\n\\nPlease buy the game, it deserves it. I NEVER say this in my reviews, in fact most are negative, but seriously 10/10 for me, here. I have no complaints.\\n\\nPS: If you have a nice rig like me (3090 and 5950X Ryzen 9) this has RTX support. Yeah, would NEVER have expected that lol, and it looks fantastic. Again, the little things that make this game really feel like it went the extra mile.',\n",

This is largely because the tutorial is only about on par with what you'd expect from a fighting game (ie. not very good.)\\n\\nBut I'm telling you; if you can stick it out for a few hours, and just stick with a couple characters that interest you it'll all click into place, and when it does — you're in for an amazing time.\",\n",

You can't bind the arrow keys either, and the menu keys don't change.\\n- The matchmaking is currently a bit wonky and the filters you set don't always work. They mentioned they are looking into that.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nThat aside, this is a fantastic fighting game and the best that KOF has been in a long, long time.\\n\\nThis game has great rollback netcode, I'm playing against people on neighboring continents without issue.\\n\\nAlso, I think they finally nailed their transition to 3D.

       "  'review': \"Let me start with the negative, because people reading reviews just want to know whats broken. Only downside to this game is the online matchmaking. Outside of prime playing time, it takes minutes to find matches. If you're on during good hours and have your settings on same region and a connection rating of 3+, have fun playing the same 2 people. It's sad because the online netcode is rock solid, virtually no lag or stutters. Matchmaking just sucks.\\n\\nOther than that, the game is great! Don't listen to the people complaining about auto combos. Yes they are there, but put in the time and no noob can out damage a manual combo. Strategy and timing will out play a guy spamming the auto combo button. Story CPU is pretty weak, on max difficulty a decent player can beat it without losing a match.\\n\\n Overall, buy. Even if you aren't a big KOF fan, showing support leads to more good fighting games and helps promote the community.\",\n",

It's very hard to find online opponents even though the game is new and populated, this could be very frustrating. Another thing is that the game content is mediocre, especially for those very interested in the single-player experience.\\n\\nThe game's netcode is pretty good. It could use some polish, but it feels good most of the time.\\n\\nI recommend this game, but you need to be patient until SNK puts all things together for the game to fully work as it should.\\n\\nUPDATE: It has been 3 months since the game released, matchmaking is still broken, and SNK is 100% silent about this big issue that is hurting the game's momentum, so I'm losing hope and my patience here. If you're planning to get the game to compete online, I can't recommend it anymore, especially if you don't have friends who own the game. Many people will say getting matches via Discord will solve the issue, but no, sorry, I not only dislike Discord, but I didn't pay full price for a game to be doing for it what one of its basic features should do for me since day 1.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game is so sick.  It feels like everything in the FG that I have been longing for since the golden days of 2D sprites with Third strike and Kof 13.  You do have to go into the .ini to turn on vsync and resolution with borderless window to fix the screen tearing and lack of 1440p.  However I am confident this will be patched and once you do that it runs amazing.  It feels good instead of having to fight against the game like other modern fighting games.  Your inputs better be on point or be prepared to train your inputs.  It isn't lenient like SFV and Strive which imo is much better long term as a player.\\n\\nAs a fighting game, 10/10.  The rollback is amazing.  I went against something with a 103 ping but the rollback frames was constantly at 2-3 and no higher.  I forgot I was playing online a few times.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I'll change my review if the game gets patched, but for now, I'm leaving a negative review because this PC port is a big step backwards compared to the KOF14 PC port.\\n\\nI've run into these issues:\\n[list][*]There's no support for 2560x1440 resolution. This is pretty baffling considering KOF14 supported it just fine (14 supported even more resolutions that's missing in 15) and UE4 itself definitely doesn't have any resolution limitations. I tried changing resolution to 2560x1440 via an INI change, but the game reverted to 1080p once you press a button at the title screen.\\n\\n[*]You can't map directional keys, space, or tab when redefining player controls. Again, KOF14 supported this just fine. You can map diretional keys if you do it via memory editing, but that shouldn't be a required step. And space and tab aren't possible since they've become system keys that's impossible to remap.\\n\\n[*]If you're a keyboard user and you're using certain keyboard locale then certain menu prompts will be impossible to ever do. For instance, there are prompts for [ and ], but there are no keys for that on my keyboard (I type them with a multikey combination), and it ends up being impossible to ever press those prompts.\\n\\n[*]The game has performance issues. I've got no idea what the cause could be, but certain moves can cause a minor stutter. The climax special moves can cause a major stutter. I've heard from other people they've experienced similar issues, so this could be bugs that affect everyone.[/list]\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m a 70 yr old lady, and I\\'ve played for some time now and I love this game. I will never be hardcore or even a good player. But there are so many things to do in this game it is almost overwhelming. Quests are very good, the story-line is very good and last but not least, the graphics are fabulous. \\nOn the downside; it is expensive being a Plus member, especially on a retirement pay (shoe-string budget). I recommend a much cheaper monthly fee. There is ofc the DLC content you get with the Plus membership but the ideal is to have a cheaper option only for that magical bag space just for crafters. Well, it\\'s just a thought.\\n\\nHappy New Year 2020!\\nJust a review of 2019 gameplay (many hours as you can see).\\nAnd I\\'m still playing (since my birthday 7 Dec 2017). I have just scratched the surface...\\nIf you are looking for an adventure out of this world (pun intended) Elder Scrolls Online is the very very best.\\nI do pay for Eso plus, I need that magic bag since I farm and horde like a squirrel and craft like a boss. I have soon maxed out my main crafter.\\nI am in a guild with absolutely fabulous and helpful people. I have started to have a bit of confidence doing trials and dungeons with this guild, they know I am old and slow and they are patient with me. Hopefully, I will be a better team player this year. I am working on it.\\nIn the meantime, I quest, explore, collect whatever, do delves, public dungeons, world bosses, farm and craft. And I enjoy it all!\\nAll the best to all gamers in 2020.\\n\\nI have edited this review, the starting-date was wrong, I got the game on 6 Dec 2017, and started to play on my B-day, 7 Dec 2017. Otherwise, counting the hours of gameplay, I must have been glued to the screen, LOL. I do have a life outside Tamriel, I promise... \\nTo All gamers Stay Safe in these crazy times. / Onna_Bugeisha\\n\\nUPDATE 2022; This coming 7 Dec I\\'ll turn 73 yrs which means that I now played this game for 5 yrs and I still love it.\\n\\nThank You! To all wonderful people for your heart-warming comments and awards. I like the titel \"Gaming Grandma\"  \\n\\nI have a confession to make - I fell in love with Horizon Zero Dawn, and spent some time there, i.e. I did 6 re-runs of that game (lol), it\\'s a fabulous game. \\n\\nNow I am back in ESO again with the new High Isle chapter and two new companions, there are just so many things to do in ESO you never run out of options. Things like crafting, just exploring and farming, decorating your homes and create gardens... even fishing is very relaxing when you need a rest from bandits and monsters. \\n\\nHave I mentioned I lured my husband from Guild Wars 2, to come and join me in ESO last year? Now we play together, so much fun. \\nA very important advice to all couples out there... this game is captivating and time-consuming - so please, see to it that you both play together or you might end up wondering what in the world happened to your significant other, seriously. \\n\\nI hope to see you in game or mail me (I am @Wing-Zun - on PC, EU server), I am in three trading guilds (BTW an excellent way to get some gold). \\n Arenthian Trade Guild - Tamriel Marketeers - The Twelwe Knights. Very nice guilds.\\nWish you all Good Gaming and take care. / Onna_Bugeisha',\n",

       "  'review': 'I have been paying this game for years, building my opinions of the game. The easiest way to describe it would be Pros v.s. Cons. \\n\\nPros:\\nEasy to learn, hard to master.\\n\\nThe Questing only gets better with each expansion.\\n\\nYou don\\'t NEED to interact with anyone. Treat it like a single player game if you want and call it hard mode.\\n\\nFun dungeons that don\\'t get boring with just a couple of runs.\\n\\nTons of \"End Game\" content to keep one busy far after they reach max gear level.\\n\\nSuper Fun PvP system with Cyrodil Tri-Banner War\\n\\nIf you want to specialize in something like crafting, it is diverse and fun enough to keep you entertained, then become extremely profitable in the future.\\n\\nCons:\\nTo be a crafter in the most efficient way, you NEED to subscribe to ESO Plus (but as a little sneaky pro, ESO Plus gives all the DLC bundled with it plus \"crowns\" equaling the price paid for subscription\"\\n\\nVETERAN MAELSTROM ARENA IS UNFAIRLY DIFFICULT favoring Magika DPS players with very good sustainability and constant shield action. A bit of tough love that pushes away newer or less experienced players.\\n\\nPvP, though really fun, has a very steep learning curve that leaves many unsure where to start, luckily PvP isn\\'t the main focus of the game.\\n\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nSo where does this leave us? Is the game worth putting in time and money? Simple answer is, yeah. Despite a rough launch in 2014, ESO has improved and worked out MOST of it\\'s flaws and kinks, making it the great and enjoyable sandbox MMO it is today. \\n\\n-If you are playing and feel you need some direction you can send me a message via mail in game @Cactusking158 and I will do my best to answer any questions that come my way.\\n\\nHappy adventuring, and may you meet many fine people along your journey.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'TLTR: ESO is the best MMO I\\'ve played so far.\\n\\n\\nThe Good.\\nIt has retained many of the best elements from the Elder Scrolls series.\\n-Fantastic sound-score.\\n-Fine graphics.\\n-A world that feels alive.\\n-Great exploration gameplay.\\n\\nThe leveling and combat system is far better than any Elder Scrolls game, by miles. For PvE combat is great, tho I haven\\'t played for long enough to get into PvP yet. You can choose to grind up to cap in a single session, if that strikes your fancy. Or you could care less about leveling and still participate fully in all non-endgame PvE.\\n\\nESO does not waste my time with long travel times, I can get to anywhere I\\'ve already been in between 30 sec to a minute. For me this is a very important point. I detest games that fakes longviety my wasting my time.\\n\\nESO is not in any way pay-to-win, and it doesen\\'t unnaturally inconvenience the player to make me pay extra. The only inconvenience in the game comes with spontaniously harvesting crafting ingrediants while questing at the same time. This was an inconvenience in the Bethesdas Elder Scrolls games aswell because of inventory. You can pay to unnaturally compensate for this inconvenience through an ingredient-bag.\\n\\nESO has pay for vanity.\\n\\nThe world is immensly open. I can go anywhere I want and be successful straight from the start. There are many questlines with their own story tying into the main story. I can choose freely what storyline to follow, or I can ignore the story entirely if I just want to grind my way to the endgame content or just want to explore. This also means the game is extremely accessible for anyone.\\n\\nCrafting is plesant and feels meaningful so far. There are crafting-quests in addition to crafting for trade, if I want to pursue it as a career. There are few games where I enjoy crafting, but in this one it seems ok.\\n\\nStealth gameplay is fun, although not innovative by any means.\\n\\nPlaying together ad hoc is fun even without groupinng up. Just running together with random people for an area or a difficult fight is quite fun. Probably because combat is fast-paced, players are considered allies for the purpose of abilities, and game mechanics generally supports doing so. It works very well for any open area I\\'ve been to, and is faster than grouping up.\\n\\nSome of the dialouge is good.\\n\\nSome of the quests are ok.\\n\\n\\nThe Bad.\\nWith the game being extremely accessible, people looking for a challenge will have to do a bit of searching or research where to go and who to hook up with.\\n\\nBecause the enemies and treasure scales with level, ESO doesen\\'t have the mother-haul aspect of treasure-hunting that some older Elder Scrolls titles had. For instance, in the original Morrowind I could sneak into an ancient abandoned fortress, find a coven of vampires there so powerful they could one-hit kill me, sneak past them, discover an endgame weapon, steal it and leave. It was a very unique feeling when just stumbling into it while exploring.\\n\\nThe community tools for ESO are the porest of any MMO I\\'ve played. I haven\\'t found an accessible way of reaching ppl even for PUGs. There is no tutorial on how to effectively get a group going, and frankly zero incentive to do so anyway in any area I\\'ve been so far. Further, getting a guild seems to be a matter of blindly accepting guild-invites from ppl spamming general chat. For instance I\\'ve found no credible channel on how to get info on guilds that may be suitable for me, seek them out and ask for an invite. As a noob I find getting involved in the community in ESO a frustrating chore.\\n\\nThere is a tool for queing to participate in dungeons (instances) with PUGs. The tool is never explained however, you just have to find it yourself. Also the queing I\\'ve done takes 30-90 minutes. Some times of the day I\\'m unable to find PUGs for dungeons at all through this tool.\\n\\nThe community also doesen\\'t seem very inviting towards new players in my experience. I\\'ve not seen anyone being very helpful towards each other yet. It\\'s not that it\\'s hostile, just not very friendly either. It may of course be because the Morrowind expansion was just released and all the established players are over there, for all I know.\\n\\nI cannot fly, levitate or do Khajiit-level jumps in ESO.\\n\\nSome of the story isn\\'t good. They all pivot around the main story in a very overt way. Like in the old arcade games, where there is a scheming badguy and everything except the end-fight is about thwarting his minions. \"His\" minions are everywhere in ESO: Tamriel, and it\\'s just to much of the same. This is very different from the other Elder Scrolls titles, where the monsters of the land seemed to make up a whole ecosystem on their own, with their own lives and events. It makes the stories that follow the quests boring after 25 hours, and deteriorating rapidly at 50 hours.\\n\\nMost of the quests are very boring. Fetch me those items or kill me those enemies. For me this may well become a reason for abandoning ESO, they were the reason I never played WoW for more than 20 minutes. In ESO they aren\\'t as bad as the ones I experienced in the other title. It\\'s normally 3-5 targets instead of 20-30. At first it seemed that this type of quests would be few, but it proved to be very frequent. A real pity.\\n\\nMany of the quests are really stupid. And I mean really really bone \\'ead stupid. Like the world-class schemer who\\'s locked himself inside a tomb and left the 3 keys outside the door at different but easy-to-find locations. Makes sense.. It\\'s back to the old arcades, only back then the format required some abstractions. In ESO it\\'s not an abstraction anymore, but a literally really dumb story-element. While there are some straight-forward story elements of the type \"some soldiers have been captured, go rescue them\", nonsense solutions are more common. Fully expect an NPC to suggest solving a problem by shooting her magic rainbow-ray at the moon while farting some magic sunshine. But first you must go find her some rare shrooms at one location, kill 4 zombies at another location, get 3 seashells, then kill an evil monster turtle-boss. Then she can find the spy who\\'s been taken prisoner by the enemy and learn what he knows. And on to the next one.\\n\\nAfter a quest is done I get a pat on the back, where the NPC tells me this was all my doing. I\\'m a hero. It\\'s not that it\\'s wrong, it\\'s just that after a while all quest-givers start to seem like a benevolent school-teacher praising a 7-year old.\\n\\n\\nThe Ugly.\\nCustomer Support are flat-out ignoring support-tickets. \\n\\nThere are 3-year old bugs that prevent installing or starting up the game for enough players that the forums have several threads each day regarding them. New players enter the forum frustrated, not being able to play. Some are able to get it working through forum advice, and others can\\'t and refund the game as a result. The ugly part is that the developers don\\'t communicate with the players and doesen\\'t even acknowledge the problem. It\\'s been 3 years now, so it seems they just don\\'t find the bugs worth the cost of resolving vs the number of resulting refunds and bad reviews.\\n\\n\\nFinal Words.\\nI don\\'t know how long ESO will keep me engaged. I\\'m currently doing the story and exploration, but unless the story starts diversifying in the next area I fear I\\'ll seek other content. Maybe that content can keep my attention, maybe not. Regardless, this is the best MMO I\\'ve played despite its shortcomings. The combat is quite good, and the absence of time-sinks count for alot. That said, I\\'ve yet to find an MMO that could hold my attention for more than a couple of months.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is a review from a new player aimed at new players.\\n\\nI played ESO back in 2014 during the beta and didn\\'t like it. I was expecting Skyrim online and it didn\\'t qualify so I lost interest very quick.\\n\\nFast forward to april 2018, after years spent on Dark Souls, Dragon\\'s Dogma, Rocket League and others ... Me and my buddies are looking for a game to play together like in the good old days. We\\'re all dads with families now and there\\'s no way we can get back to grinding like we used to (no pun intended).\\n\\nI remember ESO and wonder how it\\'s doing. People are talking about the One Tamriel update. I start a thread on Reddit asking if it\\'s casual friendly, and everyone assures me that it very much is. Might be worth a shot so me and my buddies decide to give it a try.\\n\\nESO still isn\\'t Skyrim Online, and won\\'t ever be. The logistics of a MMO don\\'t really allow the atmospheric beauty and complexity of a game like Skyrim. It is however way deeper in lore and atmosphere than any MMO I ever played, and you can tell great care is taken into making the world of Tamriel feel alive and breathing as much as can be. Every NPCs are voiced and side quests are literally everywhere. Many of them feel generic after a while, but some are actually really clever and well written. The world is absolutely humongous and very varied, with there again great care paid to respecting the Elder Scrolls lore. Long time ES players will appreciate the numerous references to stories and characters they already know well.\\n\\nGraphics are pretty great for a MMO as well. I run it maxed out and lighting effects are downright gorgeous in some places. Art direction is consistent and while some places feel a little rushed, others surprise you with high levels of details. Riding from city to city through woods and moors, across deserts and sea shores, you always feel immersed in the world as should be. They also keep improving as the latest chapter, Summerset, is more beautiful and detailed than ever before.\\n\\nGameplay is one of the things that surprised me the most as I wasn\\'t expecting it to be so fast paced. Fighting takes skills and strategy and you do need to learn to get better to earn victory, as opposed to simply leveling and spamming skills like it\\'s sometimes the case in similar games. Me and my buddies have progressed steadily and we find ourselves beating dungeons we never thought we could beat before, and not just because we leveled up but because we learned to work better as a team. It\\'s a very satisfactory feeling that the game encourages.\\n\\nClasses are varied and skill lines designed to make you enjoy a high level of freedom in gameplay. I run a Magicka Templar, and designed my character so I can switch from DPS to Tank or Healer or a mix of both when I play with my friends without much of a hassle. I\\'ll never be as performing as someone who would 100% specialize in either of these roles, but I would say that for once hybrid builds are absolutely do-able in this game, which is very rarely true in MMOs.\\n\\nOne thing responsible for us enjoying the game so much is the famed One Tamriel update. It basically removed level walls from the world and introduced a scaling system on the world map. It basically means that from level 1 to 50, you will adjust to monsters on the world map and normal delves to a beatable level. It does remove true challenge from these areas, but also allows you to roam the world freely to explore as you wish, which is a worthy trade in my opinion as it allows new players to be free to discover this enormous world like they were on an actual adventure. There are also no limits for partying with friends, so you don\\'t need to worry about overleveling when you play on your own. While it could take from the satisfying experience of leveling up in early levels, the very flexible skill system feels like enough of a reward to keep it interesting.\\n\\nWorld Bosses, Dungeons and Trials aren\\'t scaled, and that\\'s where the challenge begins. Each dungeon has several levels of difficulty and we have been steadily progressing through them in our 2 months of playing. Boss battles require strategy and analyzing the mechanics and can be quite epic. Sometimes you just don\\'t have the required level or gears, but sometimes you just have to keep trying to get better. We have beaten many bosses we thought we would never beat on our first couple tries.\\n\\nPast level 50, you start getting Champion Points, to a maximum of 750. They allow you to keep enhancing your character slowly and end up making quite a difference in the long run. As you get stronger, you\\'ll be able to complete more difficult dungeons, which grant better gears. This is really clever design, as the game never feels like a grind in the traditional MMO sense, but instead more of renewed challenges. So far it has kept it\\'s freshness to us.\\n\\nThe lack of \"grindy\" feeling is really something I want to emphasize on, as it\\'s what\\'s been preventing me from playing MMOs for so long. In my 2 months of playing I never felt myself even having the desire of grinding for levels or gears. I had fun doing quests on my own and playing with my friends, and my character naturally improved by doing so. We are still a long, long way from reaching end game content, and are in no hurry. From my experience, this is quite a feat to accomplish this feeling in a genre that is most often grindy by definition.\\n\\nOn the negative side, I would say that the game can sometimes feel a little bland, but then again it\\'s a MMO and Skyrim, Dark Souls, Witcher III and the likes have spoiled us in recent years. Quests can feel generic and repetitive but you also don\\'t need to do 80% of them.\\n\\nThe monthly subscription is by no mean necessary but access to all DLCs and their dungeons is quite pricey (and free if you subscribe). The bottomless crafting bag you get with the subscription is also pretty mandatory if you want to craft efficiently, and then again it isn\\'t a necessity as you can resell materials instead of holding on to them and ask players to craft for you.\\n\\nCrown store is mostly cosmetics or a shortcut to things you can buy with ingame currencies like skill respecs and the likes.\\n\\nAll in all, the game we were looking for at the right time for us. I highly recommend it if you are also looking for a similar chill, friendly experience in the Elder Scrolls universe.\\n\\nps: my hours logged have been greatly augmented by leaving the launcher opened all day on numerous occasions.\\n\\nedit 1: removed \"do not buy from steam\" cause issue seems fixed. would still recomend getting it from official website though just in case.\\n\\nedit 2:  my friends and i have less time to play together. reached semi endgame (CP400, all geared, vet dungeons). kinda lost motivation to play atm tho but it has a lot to do with my friends not being around as much.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] The Elder Scrolls Online - Tamriel Unlimited [/h1]\\n\\n[h1] Introduction [/h1]\\n\\nTamriel.  A continent at war. The Dominion, Pact and Covenant fight for supremacy in the Imperial province of Cyrodiil. Meanwhile, Molag Bal has stolen your fucking soul. \\n\\n[h1] Review -11/26/15 [/h1]\\n[b] Graphics [/b]\\n\\nTamriel Unlimited is pretty. It has a variety of different environments - from the sandy, sunbaked land of Elsweyr, to the frigid, unforgiving land that is Eastmarch. Whilst no, the graphics aren't particularly revolutionary, and definitely not the same quality as Skryim, this is to be expected. For an MMORPG, the Elder Scrolls Online is up there with one of the best looking. Occasionally the world looks a bit 'the same', but usually as you advance to other provinces, the environment and ambience is noticeably different. \\n\\nEDIT: After a discussion with someone who commented on this review (which you can read below) I'd like to add this: \\nSkyrim was a very graphically capable game. The base game, on ultra, compared to ESO, on ultra, is more graphically detailed than ESO in my opinion. However, this may depend on different viewpoints and whatnot. The graphics design and feel each game wishes to portray is different, and this may lead to differences in opinion - which is to be expected.\\n\\n8/10\\n\\n[b] PvE [/b]\\n\\nPlayer vs Environment is the part of this game that gets particularly monotonous. It's the easiest way to level up, as you gain a considerable amount of experience for each quest you complete, but  it does indeed become a chore. The characters are forgettable, the quests the same. Kill this, gather 'x' amount of this, talk to her/him. In my 145 hours of playtime, only a few quests have got me genuinely interested. You skip dialogue as it does not mean anything or add to the plot. It does, however, reveal some beautiful locations and there are a FEW interesting quests. For the most part, however, PvE in ESO:TU is pretty 'meh'.\\n\\n4.5/10\\n\\n[b] PvP [/b]\\n\\nIf you're not sure about buying ESO for the PvE aspect, definitely consider buying it for the PvP aspect. It is likely the most fun I've ever had in an MMORPG. Nothing quite compares to standing aside a host of 50+ players as trebuchets pound castle walls, the walls crumble, and hundreds of players clash on the field of battle. If you're an Elder Scrolls fan and have always fantasized about some sort of war in Tamriel - buy this game. You're allowed to enter Tamriel at Lvl 10 (3-4 hours of playtime?). Once you enter, your stats are boosted to Veteran Rank 1(?). This means a Level 10 can still be (relatively) effective fighting higher levels, so it's pretty balanced. The PvP itself takes place in the Imperial Province of Cyrodiil, which has been invaded by three seperate factions-\\n\\nThe Aldmeri Dominion (High Elf, Wood Elf, Khajit)\\nThe Daggerfall Covenant (Breton, Orc, Redguard)\\nThe Ebonheart Pact (Argonian, Nord, Dunmer)\\n(With Imperial package you can play as an Imperial in any alliance)\\n\\nThere are 15/16 castles around the province, 6 of which surround the Imperial City. There are also various outposts. Around the castles are resources, which, if captured, give benefits to the faction who owns them.\\nThe PvP is what makes this game, and what convinced me to stay for 100+ hours.\\n\\n9.5/10\\n\\n[b] UI/Levelling [/b]\\n\\nThe UI is well-designed, not too obtrusive. Levelling up is also pretty simple - each time you level up, you get to choose which stat to invest in - stamina, health or magicka.You can then choose a skill which you can plonk in your hotbar and use. Nothing broken or overpowered, though it does take testing to find the most effective skill sets.\\n\\n8.5/10\\n\\n[b] Crafting [/b]\\n\\nI'm not going to lie, I've not experimented in crafting at all, so this section is from friends' experiences.\\nIt's good. Dying your items can make your armor very unique, the materials are varied and it does take up time. It's not simple. Which is good.\\n\\n8/10\\n\\n[b] Framerate [/b]\\n\\nI play this game on a GTX 770 and i7 4770. In the midst of a battle, with dozens of spells and effects going on as well as 100+ players on screen performing their own actions, it did not drop below 50fps. Well optimized, large scale PvP is the only time I've ever dropped below 60fps.\\n\\n9/10 \\n\\n[b] Grouping [/b]\\n\\nThe group questing/dungeons in this game are good, again, but not particularly revolutionary or exciting. Standard group quests and dungeon, pretty simple. Not a huge variety right now, I think there are about 7/8 without the Orsinium/Imperial City DLC. I've had loads of fun playing dungeons with friends, but it does become a bit stagnant once you've repeated them several times.\\n\\n7/10\\n\\n[b] Conclusion [/b]\\n\\nThis game is good. The PvP is excellent, and while the PvE isn't particularly impressive, it still functions. Bugs have almost all been ironed out. Worth your money if you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, and are willing to accept certain sacrifices made by Zenimax to make the game a better MMO.\\n\\n[b] OVERALL: 8.5/10 [/b]\\nNew Witcher 3 review: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079374616/recommended/292030/\\n-my first proper review, feel free to comment constructive criticism/positive feedback-\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So, I hated this game at first...\\n\\n I\\'ve never been into a MMO before, and I went into it with a mindset of \"FUCK YEAH! MULTIPLAYER SKYRIM LETS GO\" - In short don\\'t do that. This isn\\'t going to be like playing Skyrim, Oblivion, Morrowind. \\n\\nIt is when it all comes down to the core an MMO, it\\'s set in Tamriel, it sounds like Tamriel and the storylines feel like an Elder Scrolls game. However being an MMO, it has a lot of grindy MMO style quests. And don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s bewildering at first, all these mechanics, all these places to go....and before the \\'One Tamriel\\' update if you chose the wrong faction, you were screwed, in a place all on your own surrounded by all these people who are WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY higher level than you. But thankfully they changed all of that. The game scales now, so you can rock up to a dungeon with your level V300 mate, and still have some fun slicing up enemies.\\n\\nSo I saw a friend playing the other day, and spent a few hours installing this to join him (By the way its like 70 Gig...If you have slow internet prepare for a few days of download), I got back on it after not playing for 14 months, but this time I was playing with a friend who was already Veteran Level 250, So I was in luck, he introduced me to everything and I got used to all the deconstructing of equipment to get my blacksmithing up, showed me about dungeons and bascially got me to enjoy the grind. I think my previous time was a bit lackluster because I got dropped in the middle of the Aldmeri Dominion on my own, without any of my friends. So I left.\\n\\nNow I know what I\\'m doing, and keep in mind I usually hate MMO\\'s never played WoW or anything like that, this is the first one. I\\'m enjoying myself, I\\'m triple digits into this game time-wise and I don\\'t see it stopping now. We\\'ve made a guild for noobies. To help them out, and get them to enjoy the game also. Because the community is nice...but you still get the elitist fucks from any competitive game kicking you out of dungeons because you\\'re only level 14. But you won\\'t get that when you\\'re in a guild, having people to play with and explain all the mechanics did help, a lot. I\\'ve even gone as far as to buy this AGAIN on steam just to collect my hours and so on.\\n\\nAdd-ons are awesome being able to mod basic features of the game to help with information and quality of life improvements is a must. I\\'ll provide an essential mods pack if any of you wish to know.\\n\\nFor those of you who actually got this far into this, well done. I didn\\'t think I\\'d keep you captivated long enough to get to the end.\\n\\nIf any of you are new to the game, on EU server and would like to join a guild to show you the way, add me or visit our [url=www.godsofsalt.com]website[/url] and join us on teamspeak, or just message us in game @diseasedcrow.\\n\\nBut all in all if you like Elder Scrolls and you think you want to try this, just do, I\\'m glad I gave it a second chance.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I've thought a lot about whether to give this game a bad review or not. I almost did, but it would be unfair to the game. The largest and most painful issue I have with this game is the in-game shop and the way that this game has been monetized. It is so terribly monetized, that I almost gave this game a negative review. ZOS claim to only sell cosmetics and conveniences, however both of these things clash with the core gameplay of ESO. \\n\\nThere are a number of rewards which are only obtainable through purchasing crowns with money, and with extremely expensive costs too. The game is objectively worse off by the existence of these things. I can count on one hand the number of mounts you can collect in game, but the number of mounts you can buy or obtain through ZOS's loot boxes is closer to 100. This gives players less things to actually play for, less things to collect and fewer targets to set for themselves.\\n\\nIn addition, you can buy time-savers which grant you ability points (if you've collected them on other characters), experience scrolls, mount training and the research scrolls for professions. The issue I take with the existence of these items is indicative of the fact that ZOS are aware that these grinds are a slug. They are literally time-gated; you can learn one mount training skill every 24 hours, of which there are 180 skills to spend. That is half a year of spending points to max out your mount training. This grind must be done on each character. The research scrolls speed up the rate at which you research a trait in a weapon. When researching a trait, you must wait an increasing amount of actual time before unlocking it and researching another. My main character has gotten to the point that she must wait 20+ days to learn a new trait in some professions. Or I can throw my wallet at ZOS and get it done instantly. ZOS, I want to play your game, but you're making it so hard.\\n\\nThe largest houses you can buy typically sell for around 14,000 crowns (€85) and are unobtainable otherwise. On the other hand the housing system in the game is phenomenal. It suffers a lot though when considering how expensive furnishings actually are, especially when compared to how little gold you actually get for just playing the game. While players can obtain some furniture pieces through playing the game, these are extremely few and far between when considering just how many furniture pieces there actually are in the game. The nicer furniture pieces are often priced at 10,000 gold, up to 100,000 for the fanciest pieces. When you only get 300 gold for completing a quest, as a player, you must look to get money through other systems if you want to engage fully with housing and furnishing. ZOS, PLEASE increase the amount of gold you get from quests. This leads me to the auction house in game, and ESO plus. \\n\\nThe best way to obtain money in this game, is by engaging in the auction house. I love the auction house system in the game, and the way it forces players to be a part of a guild(s). One thing to help you make gold is the use of the extra bank storage and (literally infinite) crafting bag you get when subscribing to ESO plus. If you plan to sell any crafting materials and you don't have the crafting bag, be prepared to have a full inventory every 10 minutes. It's like ZOS are aware that not playing with the crafting bag is a handicap, and so they move it to a pay-wall. There are other ways to make money in the game, such as farming for rare item drops for hours on end, hoping that one will eventually drop which you can sell for a lottery cash out\\n\\nZOS are masters at creating problems and selling you the solution. The in-game store and the monetization is in direct conflict with the soul of this game, and I never feel satisfied playing this game. I want to engage in the housing, but the rate at which I can actually buy furniture, if I just do quests is extraordinarily slow. The crowns I get with the ESO plus subscription make it a bit better, as they allow me to buy furniture and housing with crowns instead of gold, but I can't help but feel like this doesn't have to be a problem at all.\\n\\nZOS, fix your monetization. I paid for this game, let me play it without locking features behind time-gates and pay-walls. If you want this game to be subscription based, make it subscription based, put everything from the store into the game, and remove the store. You can't have it both ways. I want to love this game, but with the way this game is monetized, I can't. \\n\\nIf you enjoy questing and story-telling, you will probably enjoy the game if you don't engage with any of the things above. But you might get frustrated at always having a full backpack and having to walk past all of the mining and herb nodes because you don't have the space to pick them up. And then not having any money because you can't trade the materials you don't have.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Below you will find a video of my first impressions with the game.\\n\\nThe game is very good. But here is the problem, most people come into it expecting Skyrim online. DO NOT DO THIS!\\n\\nFirst let me get this out of the way, as this needs to be noted! \\n\\nIf you look at the game as an MMO first and a TES game second you will not be disappointed. Others will look at the limitations compared to Skyrim or other TES single player games. Instead i look at the freedoms! I can loot just about every container i come across, i can go into pretty much every building i come across. Other mmo\\'s don\\'t do this. Other mmo\\'s don\\'t have things scattered across their dungeons to loot aside from corpses. Someone else might say \"well i can\\'t pick up everything like i can in Skyrim\" No you can\\'t, but what mmo let\\'s you? In this you can at least interact with objects more than other games. \\n\\nThe combat: You don\\'t just stand in place watching cool downs! You have to react to your enemy, you have to block and dodge. You can\\'t get away with auto attacking! They have improved the feel of combat, you don\\'t feel like you are slicing thin air anymore. \\n\\nThe community: It\\'s amazing! Everyone i have spoken to has been extremely friendly, eager to group up, eager to role play and get into character. No one is arguing in the chat! No one is spamming to sell you gold.\\n\\nThe crafting: It\\'s just as much fun as other TES games, collecting the reagents you need isn\\'t a chore because the world is fun to explore and gather in! There are plenty of recipes to find and experiment with.\\n\\nThe world: The game looks great, it\\'s not mind blowing great, but it does look good, especially for an MMO. This isn\\'t going to look like a graphic mod for Skyrim so forget that! But it\\'s no slouch either. The lighting is very well done but some textures can be bland. \\n\\nThe customization: This is a big one! This game has a TON of customization options, dozens of skills to choose from which only get added on from joining things like the fighters and mages guild or becoming a werewolf or vampire! You can use any weapon and any armor type, there are thousands of builds for each class! The best customization i have ever seen and i\\'ve been a rabid MMO gamer since 2003. \\n\\nThe crown store: It isn\\'t pay to win! It\\'s very similar to GW2 and there are only aesthetic options available. I was so pleased by this that i found myself WANTING to give them money in return for a cool looking mount, pet and costume. They don\\'t pester you for money with pop ups or anything annoying like that. You buy the game and you choose to purchase aesthetics on your own terms. \\n\\nI haven\\'t experienced PvP yet and i haven\\'t got to end game, i am enjoying my time in the game as a slow burn and i recommend you do the same! DO NOT be in a rush to get to cap! Live in the world, enjoy your ascent!\\n\\nIn closing i will just say the game got a bad rep early on. Essentially people were paying for a beta until Tamriel Unlimited launched so i can understand their frustrations. But the game is in a MUCH better place now, i\\'m sure it\\'s going to be very popular when it launches on consoles and the PC community seems to be growing now that the game is B2P! \\n\\nThank you for reading my review and i hope you find it helpful. \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1v-ooOQ4xU&list=PLATrmgzMmuhOLFLFVtQVg65ZwIfrErIYp&index=1',\n",

       "  'review': \"I'm pushing 1500 hours and decided it was time for a review. Here you go.\\n\\nAs a long time Morrowind addict I was hesitant to jump on the ESO bandwagon.  I'd heard a lot of bad stuff about it when it was first released and solidly decided I was in the camp of 'that's not a real Elder Scrolls game, it's a cashgrabbing, PVPing, mainstream-appealing mess'.  Which. to be fair, was kind of accurate back around initial release (from what I've heard). Jump forward give years though, and it's come a looooooooong way.\\n\\nLore: \\nIf I'd started playing and found the lore side of things to be poorly addressed I would have stopped playing. I haven't stopped playing. Established lore is maintained and adhered to well, and the game adds its own bits and pieces - some new stuff, some expanding on previous knowledge.  And there's plenty of books lying around for the lore enthusiasts to pore over. You could quite easily play the game and completely ignore the lore aspect, if that''s your thing, but you'd be missing out on a huge part of the charm of the ES world.\\n\\nGameplay: \\nTop notch questing, both the main questlines (of which there are many) and also standalone side quests. Keeping in line with previous titles in the series, there's been an effort made to minimise 'Go and kill X bandits' or 'Fetch me X golden watercress seeds' type quests. While ultimately all quests will be basically 'Go there, do this, come back' they are well presented, relevant to the storyline and generally cohesive.\\n\\nThere are less world-changing decisions that can be made than in other games of the series, but that's part and parcel of the MMO genre. Occasionally you will meet a new character who obviously thinks they know you - as far as I can tell this is an overhand from early days when different areas of the world were levelled, and progress was more linear. Modern ESO has level-scaling across the board, meaning you can access previously 'end-game' zones from the get go. It's not gamebreaking, and very minor - took me ages to even realise it was happening. \\n\\nCombat:\\nMy first impression was that regardless of class/playstyle you end up being forced to do magick-y stuff. Coming from earlier games where playing as a warrior (or whatever non-magic class) means you can basically light attack, heavy attack or block I was....somewhat irked. Combat is basically a combination of buffing yourself/debuffing enemies with 'abilities' and then using normal attacks interspersed with other 'abilities'. All these abilities are accompanied by much pomp and circumstance - flames, sparkles, sound effects and such. I was kind of miffed that I couldn't just hit things with a sword/arrow/morningstar and occasionally swig a health potion. Once again, it's an MMO - not a single player adventure game. Took a while to get used to, but you adjust. There's also wiggle room if you want to be more of a purist, but you'll be cutting yourself off from most of the group/endgame activities by doing so.\\n\\nClasses/Races:\\nWell handled. Nightblade is the quintessential 'Thief' class, Sorceror is the 'Mage' and Templars, Dragonknights and Wardens are a bit of a mixed bag. There's less of a Warrior/Mage/Thief theme and more of a Damage/Healer/Tank vibe to the whole affair, due to the traditional 4 man party setup for group activities. Too much reading online will convince you that to be any good at all you need to shoehorn yourself into the current 'meta' build for whatever role you want to fill. Reading these guides and builds is a great way to understand how to use skills more effectively or learn how different armour sets can help in combat, but at the end of the day they're best ignored. Play the character you want to play - if you were good enough to benefit from squeezing an extra 1.6% DPS out of your toon you wouldn't need to read a guide to find out how to do it.\\n\\nRaces are pretty faithful to tradition, with 'passives' that are vaguely in line with with the old 'Altmer have extra magicka', 'Khajiit be sneaky' stuff. Nothing to prevent you from making an Orc healer or an Altmer brawler if you wish, though.\\n\\nCommunity:\\nGenerally good, always feel free to ask questions in zone chat if you need a hand with something. Lot's of helpful sorts out there. PUGs can be a bit toxic sometimes, but it's easy to just leave the group if you can't be bothered dealing with someone excessively unpleasant. Hundreds of guilds to join, everything from trading to roleplaying to hardcore score pushers. On that note, if you're trying to do an endgame trial and suck, the other people are NOT being toxic. There's an expectation that you will contribute effectively, and if you're not, well tough potatoes.\\n\\nCrafting:\\nOnly mentioning because it's a big part of the in-game economy and a main reason for lots of people to play. In the course of your adventures you'll collect oodles of furnishing designs, armor and weapon style diagrams, foodstuffs, raw resources and other shiny bits and bobs. Level up your crafting skills and you can make your own gear, make furniture, potions/poisons to use or sell. You can also just go out foraging for stuff and sell your spoils through a guild for a tidy profit. Nice low-key way to spend an hour or two if you don't feel like combat or questing and just want to romp around outside enjoying the landscape.\\n\\nReal money:\\nYes, there's a 'Crown Store' where you can buy stuff with your IRL fundage. I don't think many people use it. Lot's of flashy stuff (and lots of cosmetics) that after a few weeks of playing you can mostly find or make yourself in-game. Subscribing to ESO Plus gets you an unlimited inventory for crafting resources (very handy) and access to all the DLC content (which can also be purchased one-off if you prefer). It also gives you 1500 crowns per month, so you can fritter it away on the more useful/appealing items if you so wish. The game is fully playable without subscribing, it's really just a QOL improvement and means you don't have to pay upfront for the many DLC zones.\\n\\nOverall:\\nI love this game. It's huge, both geographically and in terms of content. New areas are being released regularly and despite the whining on forums, the dev team does a good job of addressing issues and making the game enjoyable, accessible and true to the lore of the Elder Scrolls universe.  You can play this as an MMO, a single-player game or anything in between. You can RP your way through the overland regions, or min-max your way onto some very competitive leaderboards.  For me, it's a great continuation of he Elder Scrolls series and also a very enjoyable (and affordable) MMO without that horrible WoW feel to it. You're not forced into any particular playstyle based on your class or race, and there's enough content to keep anyone busy for many thousands of hours. \\n\\nIf you enjoy the Elder Scrolls universe, or MMOs, or RPGs in general, I suggest you give it a try. It's a bit of a mixed bag, but such a large bag that you'll never get bored. \\n\\nEnjoy!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Gamble\\'s ESO REVIEW [/h1]\\n[i] After spending over 4000 hours i feel its time to voice my personal opinion about the game. [/i]\\n\\n[b] My Own Experience [/b]\\nI first started The Elder Scrolls online when the Vvardenfell DLC released roughly Mid June 2017, after years of playing other different types of games i decided i needed my MMORPG fix again. I was not sure what to expect but i knew i was a fan of The Elder Scrolls Universe, playing most the previous games in the series and being a big fan of the lore so i decided to give the online version a chance. \\n\\nI purchased the normal game standard edition which is the base game. To buy the DLC for the game there are a few options such as straight up buy the DLC which will cost you crowns (they do sometimes have offers for these) or you can buy into their ESO+ subscription. From a fresh point of view, i was thinking \"do i really want to pay more money after just buying the game\". After asking a few of my friends who had played the game before i did more digging and found out it was HIGHLY BENEFICIAL, you get a lot of perks such as:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Access to all current and future DLC\\'s \\n    [*]Unlimited crafting bag (Go nuts and pick up everything!)\\n    [*]Double Bank Space\\n    [*]10% more gold/xp\\n[/list]\\n[i] HINT [/i]\\nI would recommend you buy the base game first, see if you enjoy the game and if you think you will play the game longer buy ESO+ honestly that crafting bag is life, a lot of people from my experience say \"i cant live without this anymore\". and the fact that you get access to all the DLC content is just fantastic.\\n\\n[b]Factions in the game [/b]\\nBefore playing the game i did some research to find out the best race and class to choose for each role. Like other games i played i wanted to see what each class had to offer e.g. which class did the most dps, who was the best healer or the most beefy tank. When picking a race you are also choosing a certain faction depending where that race comes from in the world, which is one of 3:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Daggerfall Covenant (Blue)\\n    [*]Ebonheart Pact (Red)\\n    [*]Aldmeri Dominion ( Yellow)\\n[/list] \\n[i] HINT [/i]\\nNow a days there is an option to buy \"any race any faction bundle\" which some people might see as annoying and an excuse for the devs to take more of your money. However this is mainly aimed at open world pvp, so unless you are going to pvp a lot or want to be in the same faction as your friends, pick any race which you find appealing. There is always the option to make another character of the same faction to play with friends.\\n\\n[b] Classes currently in the game [/b]\\nI remember the first Character i ever made was a Warden, As the DLC had just released and not many people had played it i thought it would be good fun. Later down the line however i learnt the hard way the bear can be annoying. There is a way to control your bear so it doesn\\'t randomly pull mobs in trials or the boss at the end. I remember doing this many times :D  but i was never told and it was never obvious there was a button to press for your bear companion to be non hostile. \\n\\nMany of the classes tool-kits have been changed which has lead to them getting buffed and nerfed either many times or a few times. Honestly sometimes it feels like the devs are unsure how to balance some of the skills in the class. They either go from one extreme to making it powerful or not very useful and weak. Saying that now a days if you wanted to play, there are so many different sets to wear in the game to help you out, if you want more damage or need better sustain. Please see the list below of the current classes in the game so far.\\n[list]\\n    [*]Templar \\n    [*]Sorcerer\\n    [*]Dragonknight\\n    [*]Nightblade\\n    [*]Warden (Crown Store)\\n    [*]Necromancer (Crown Store)\\n[/list] \\n[b] Races currently in the game [/b]\\nI enjoyed the customisation different races, you get given lots of choices to make your characters look unique and different. E.g a fat male Wood Elf dressed as a belly dancer, or a fancy Orc with a moustache. Please see the list below for current races in the game\\n[list]\\n    [*]Breton\\n    [*]Redguard\\n    [*]Orc\\n    [*]Nord\\n    [*]Argonian\\n    [*]Dark Elf\\n    [*]Khajiit\\n    [*]Wood Elf\\n    [*]High Elf\\n    [*]Imperial (Crown Store)\\n[/list] \\n[i] HINT [/i]\\nHonestly unless you want to min/max your character, you don\\'t really have to worry about choosing which race and class to play. Now a days there isn\\'t too much different between all the races. Other then that just have fun! Try out many classes and see which suits your play style.\\n\\n[b] What is there to do in the game? [/b]\\nWhen first playing I was not sure what to expect but i knew that i wanted to have fun and see all the different things the game offered such as:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Map zones (Questing, Fishing, Skyshards, Dolmens)\\n    [*]PVP (Battlegrounds, Imperial city, Cyrodiil)\\n    [*]Trials (12 player content)\\n    [*]Guilds (Trials, progression, trading, Roleplaying, causal) \\n    [*]Dueling (Tournaments)\\n    [*]Housing (Competitons)\\n    [*]Achievement hunting \\n    [*]Arena\\'s ( 4 player content and single player content)\\n    [*] In-Game Events \\n    [*] Dungeons (4 player content, normal and vet)\\n[/list]\\n[b] Positives [/b]\\nLots of helpful and friendly guilds, there are so many guilds in the game you could almost go as far to call them small communities, usually in a guild if you need help or are unsure they will answer any questions you have about the game.\\n\\nProgression guilds, are great if you want to get into the end game content, unlike other guilds that require x amount of dps, progression guilds normally don\\'t have such a high benchmark and love to help train new people, give advise and explain the mechanics of tougher content.\\n\\nYou never know when you will make friends, the amount of times i have been doing something random and then i just become good friends with a person is crazy, A lot of people are nice and are willing to help if you have any questions.\\n\\nSo much lore in the game to explore, as the game takes place in the past you can see what the world used to be like.\\n\\n[b] Negatives [/b]\\nFPS seems to be an issue when pvping in open world e.g. you run into so many loading screens, or come against so many players that your PC cant keep up and your skill bar doesn\\'t work. \\n\\nWhen trying to get into a dungeon, that can be quite the experience, sometimes even with a full group the finder doesn\\'t seem to work, people can leave randomly halfway through a dungeon, they can just be rude and run most the dungeon and skip bosses. PUG AT YOUR OWN RISK! that\\'s right your heard me, when trying to randomly enter a vet dlc dungeon yikes. It is honestly like gambling with your time, you will either get a really good group, or a terrible group of people who get mad, blame others and leave. \\n\\nDry End game content, sadly this isn\\'t the most challenging game of all time. When you get later into the game with more experience and understand the mechanics from the dungeons, you lose that sense of its a challenge. The same can go for trials, with all the top end raiding guilds out there, they go and smash so many of these trials in record times each patch. \\n\\nSteam Login issues, sometimes after a long maintenance you find that some people are able to login fine but people who brought the game on Steam have to wait hours more to play the game.\\n\\n[b] Overall [/b]\\nI have really enjoyed my time playing this game, from the social aspect i have met so many people in different guilds, who have become good real life friends. Sometimes in guilds they run so many events like, make the ugliest outfit, dungeon races, fishing together in a group of 20+ or just dress the same as a guild and bombard a town by dancing everywhere. I WOULD RECOMMEND this game if you want to be part of a good community, who loves the ESO lore and wants to have fun, there are honestly so many guilds out there which offer a lot!\\n\\nHappy Adventuring! Hope to see you in the game :)',\n",

       "  'review': 'First and foremost I am a solo player. I am just going to compare this to WoW and my personal preferences as a solo player. This game seems to be a better fit for me than WoW.\\n\\nI enjoy the leveling process in WoW, but lose interest fast once I hit max level. I am simply not interested in raiding, playing in groups, or PvP. I like being able to walk away from the game or take a break at any time. In WoW the quests are pretty boring, they\\'re primarily text, etc. Your character just really cannot become more powerful playing solo past a certain point. However, I have a pattern of re-subbing WoW every time an expansion comes out and quitting shortly after hitting max level.\\n\\nNow I am giving ESO a go and I\\'ve been enjoying it a lot. Why? The quests are amazing. It\\'s fully voiced over which means I am actually engaged and paying attention to what\\'s going on (all I did was skip the dialog in WoW). The quests are far more detailed when it comes to the story behind them, the tasks, the environments, etc. It\\'s so much more than the zillion fetch quests or kill X monsters quests in WoW. The main story quests in WoW were good, but that\\'s it. The rest of them are not. In ESO there is just no end to high quality engaging quests. I opted for ESO plus as well which opens up a million more. I\\'m only level 19 after 71 hours and having a great time.\\n\\nI prefer the combat in ESO. It\\'s simpler. I\\'m OK but was never really good at WoW. Just OK. ESO lets me keep it as simple as possible. I run 1 bar of 5 skills; that\\'s it. The combat is less twitchy, but still very reactive in nature. You have to block, roll, interrupt caster, and use your 5 abilities, but it\\'s just way simpler. Those basic functions of rolling, blocking, and interrupting are way more intuitive in ESO in my opinion because you\\'re using your movement keys and attack keys to do it; not a special ability. The monsters in ESO are easier to \"read\" compared to WoW. In WoW you really need to sort of memorize different types of attacks, abilities, etc. to know how to avoid or counter them. In ESO there is a target on the ground to avoid, it\\'s always the same interrupt, always the same roll, etc. It\\'s been easy to manage for me as an OK player and, honestly, more fun for me. I don\\'t feel like I suck. I also feel like \"meta\" probably matters less in ESO and small mistakes don\\'t really ruin anything. I might be wrong because I am still new, but that is the feeling I am getting.\\n\\nAnyway, that\\'s me! Solo player, just OK or decent at playing MMOs in general, needs voiced over content to keep me engaged, etc. I am really liking it and definitely recommend it. Hopefully this helps someone with a similar preference or background make a decision.',\n",

       "  'review': 'At the time of writing this I am roughly around 180 hours in the game.\\n\\nWhen I first got into Elder Scrolls it was with Skyrim. Playing only that and none of the other previous games I was blown away with how detailed that game was. When I heard that a MMORPG was made with the same title I was very enthusastic. When I got Elder Scrolls Online, I was told it would not be \"Skyrim Online\", and to an extent, those whom mentioned it were correct. However my thoughts and feelings on that statement have changed quite a bit.\\n\\nAfter playing for as long as I have, which in comparison to many others, I have found this to be right at home with my previous experience with Skyrim. I absolutley love this game. I feel that it is totally worth the $60 price tag and I invite other open minded players to give this game a shot. There are many differences from the Single Player version of Elder Scrolls but all of the reasons I loved Skyrim are placed in this game.\\n\\nThe ability to customize my character in any way I see fit, the endless caves, areas and places of interest to see. Fully voiced NPC\\'s and endless hours of lore and other content for players to experience. Not to mention that NPC\\'s reconize your heroic feats as you walk by them, often singing your praises and sometimes even questioning some of your actions that you have made in the game. In fact, there are many circumstances where I have had to make a tough decision and have spent much time dwelling after the fact if I made the right call. Should I have helped fight at the docks or was defending the fort the better call? The result might be the same but the fact that I even had to contemplate the lives of fictional NPC\\'s that I would never meet again shows how enriching the plot can be.\\n\\nThe  PvP in my opinion is very hard, but very fun. I die often, but its not frustrating. Being able to team togeather with random strangers, plan an attack and take a fort seems like it would be difficult to do but everyone is on board and ready to play the game. They want to succeed as much as you and I found the community helpful and enriching, not to mention being able to use seige weapons is so much fun and adds a level of excitment I didn\\'t realize was part of the game.\\n\\nIn the non PvP side, I found most players to be felpful, friendly and very outgoing. I found a guild almost right away and in that guild was open minded Veteren players who wanted to help grow and encourage newer players. Often investing a lot of time and energy explaining various parts of the game such as Armor, Weapons, Skill\\'s, ect. Even non guild members and complete strangers are often pretty nice. I can recall looking for a Werewolf Bite and after a few bad players asking me for a ton of gold and crafting materials in order to give me a bite, one player simple messaged me and say \"don\\'t pay them anything, I will give it to you for free.\" Not only that but he also gave me tips on how to complete the Werewolf single player quest.\\n\\nI plan on sticking with this MMORPG for a very long time. Its fun, its first person, its 3rd person and its live action. It has its faults, all games do, but if you can take things with an open mind and a grain of salt you will find much love for this awesome game. It wont ever be \"Skyrim Online\" but in many ways I really feel it is. A great story, great community of players, a big wide open world to explore with choices that are unique to your character. Seems pretty close in my opinion.\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"I originally pre-ordered this game back in 2014. I found it to some-what fun but other titles at the time were far more interesting to me and ended up side-tracking me from playing ESO.\\nI had stopped playing the game all together, and did not return.\\n\\nI recently read that the game had been revamped for 2020 offering many more features, and changes.\\nI have now played a character from the start in 2020 and leveled that character to max level, here is my honest review:\\n\\nPROS: \\n-Great scenery, graphics are great, character models look awesome.\\n-Excellent exploration, seriously, you will find yourself just running around looking at interesting things from time to time.\\n-Fun combat, controls flow nicely. Also cool to see an MMO that can be played on controller.\\n-Character building is very unique in this and allows the creator of the character to really build a very unique feeling class. This allows for quite a diversity in game-play.\\n-PVP Game mode is very fun. Definitely has a learning curve, but once you figure it out, the PVP is very unique and offers a lot of replay-ability.\\n-In game purchases are available but none of them are a pay to win option. (The in-game purchases are mostly stuff like costumes or cosmetic changes.)\\n-There are some nostalgic elements in this game that remind me of previous single player Elder Scrolls titles.\\n\\nCONS:\\n-The questing is interesting, but can become repetitive and chore-like. (As is per normal of an MMO)\\n-Alot of the quests share some overly similar story-lines. However, I do also understand this is an MMO with tons of quests in it.\\n-The dungeons do get better towards the higher character levels, but at first they offer zero challenge and are fairly boring. I found myself just kind of running around, using random abilities with no serious sense of direction.\\n-First person game-play is neat to offer, but is never used. There is seriously no point in using it.\\n-There can be a few moments when playing where you can get stuck on terrain or find it hard to jump up on top of something, which can be minorly annoying. \\n-Group queuing for PVP is currently removed, which in my opinion takes away from the PVP experience.\\n\\nOverall I would recommend this game if you're a fan of MMOs and of course a fan of the Elder Scrolls games.\\nThis game does have an Elder Scrolls feel to it, the environment and game-play does feel like Tamriel.\\nIf you're going to compare this game to World of Warcraft, you won't like it. It has a very different play style, however I do believe that ESO has a refreshing feel to it.\\n\\nThe developers appear to still care about the game as well, being that content is regularly added to keep the game interesting.\\n\\nTLDR: Game is good, give it a go.\\n\",\n",

They knew that no one would like the paid subscription and so they finally made it free (after initial purchase).\\n\\nThis game is a MUST HAVE for Elder Scrolls fans, and players who want a \"new\" type of MMO.\\n\\nPROS:\\n+ Good Combat System, No turn taking, and no point and spam keys.\\n+ No \"Grab this, kill ten of these\" Quests are INTERESTING AND FUN.\\n+ Lore is great, I really get immersed in this game.\\n+ NOT PAY TO WIN.\\n+ GOOD ECONOMY. I can buy iron ore 12g in one area and sell it to another player 15g in a different area.\\nAlso no Crowns for Gold, So rich people cant mess up the economy.\\n+ Decisions affect gameplay.\\n+ Feels like a single player game, plays like an MMO.\\n+ First person, third person, and birds eye veiw for all players and preferences.\\n+ Amazing soundtrack.\\n+ No paid subscription.\\n+ No lowkey *BUY OUR STUFF PLZ* (ex. Guild wars 2 chest drops and keys.)\\n+ Quick and fast customer support.\\n+ PvP is very fun. Destroying forts with siege equipment is a blast.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Character creator is absolute trash. needs WAY more hairstyles and body mods.\\n- Must do quests to level up. Grinding takes forever.\\n- Needs more classes besides 4 basic ones.\\n- Needs more spells.\\n- Wish it had more of a \"I am me\" feel. \\n- Shopkeepers will give you 1 gold for items that took your FOREVER to get.\\n\\nThe good outweighs the bad TREMENDOUSLY. Buy this game, have fun and recommend it! Lets get this to overwhelmingly positive like it deserves.\\n\\n\\n***EDIT***\\n\\nAfter playing for some time, I started to play with a friend. We started two new characters and were going to complete quests together.\\n\\nThe group questing needs some major improvements.\\n\\nSuggestions to the Developers:\\n\\n+Add need/greed system\\n+If I complete an objective, my partner should NOT have to complete that same objective.\\n+Players should have a \"Waiting for buddy\" before going to next area/ talking to an NPC.\\n+Players should be able to teleport to buddy, their exact location if they become to far apart.\\n+Players should be able to \"duel\" friends or other players.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The community is good and I've had a great time over the years until now. The company literally hates its player base by refusing to listen to feedback on how to make it better, obvious the dev's don't really play themselves or they would know. They shut down any criticism and leave bugs hanging for months if not years and ask you keep spending money. The cash shop is ridiculously over priced and the crate system and gems are as most games, a rort. New dungeons that should be included with new map DLC are sold to you as micro DLC's like a damn EA game. They flat out refuse to fix the PVP content and fix the issues in cyrodiil and server lags. The fact they out right silence criticism tells you all you need to know. I'm sad that this game has gone in this direction of instead of making great content they just add more crap to the cash store when game content is what will bring players back old and new. I've spent a shameful amount of hours in this game since launch so this is not a drive by thought. Bottom line, they don't care about game play, only cash shop.\",\n",

It has the story elements that are familiar to Elder Scrolls fans, but the format is similar to that of any MMORPG. There is a lot of content you can play solo, but there is also content that can or must be done in groups. \\n\\n[b]Story[/b]: Depends on the zone, can range from 4/10 to 9/10. \\n\\n[b]Quest Design[/b]: Depends on the quest and on play style. Can be a 9/10 if you're interested in the lore, but if you're more interested in skipping any and all relevant dialogue and just doing tasks, it can get dull. \\n\\n[b]Content[/b]: 11/10, I am 800 hours in and I have about 30%-40% more content left in the game in terms of quests and areas alone, not including dungeons and trials. \\n\\n[b]Graphics[/b]: 9/10, the fantasy style means that the game ages well despite being 2014. \\n\\n[b]Difficulty[/b]: 3/10 to 9/10. (Easy to learn, difficult to master.) \\n\\n[b]Combat[/b]: 6/10. It's average, nothing too insane but not horrible either. \\n\\n[b]UI[/b]: 5/10 in its base form, but can be raised much higher with addons on PC. \\n\\n[b]Price[/b]: Low. It goes on sale often, and if you get the non-upgrade edition of the newest expansion (Greymoor at the time of this writing), you get all of the past major DLCs as well, so you don't need to play catch-up. Unlike what others may claim, [i]subscription is not required[/i]. You can get the subscription if you want to try out the DLC or if you are a hard-core player or interested in doing major crafting. However, if you are just a casual once-in-a-while player, there is no need to buy the subscription. This also means that if you are about to have a busy time irl, you can pause your subscription without being locked out of the game if you still want to plat occasionally but not enough to warrant it.\\n\\nYes, there are crown crates and a crown store and stuff that does cost real money in most cases. No, you can't collect everything in the game, even if you toss a Jeff Bezos salary at it. And that's part of the beauty of it -- no two people have the exact same stuff. Besides, all of the things that people cry are super expensive or in the crown crates? [b][i]It's all cosmetic!!![/i][/b] I really don't see why people are losing their ***es over it when they're the ones willingly paying stupid amounts of money for minor cosmetic changes. \\n\\nYou can play the game 100% without ever needing to get anything from the crown store or paying any more for it. This ain't World of Warcraft, people,\\n\\nAt $10 on sale for base game, it's worth at least a try.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll start by saying this. I have played many MMOs in my days. Some more than others such as Ultima, Runescape, World of Warcraft, FF14...but Elder Scrolls Online, mind you this is in this gamer\\'s opinion, has been the richest, immersing, and positive community driven MMO I have ever played.\\n\\n-:::The community:::-\\nThe player community of ESO has always been thoughtful, encouraging, and kind. There have only been probably two occurrences of a player being toxic in my 1200+ hours of playing. Even if you\\'re not in a guild and you want to \"Sword Online \\'\\' it a bit, players you meet in the game are in one word, Awesome! Want to hear something even more dope? Players will sometimes help you get the gear you need by being on the lookout in rando dungeon runs. I do this myself and just trade the gear without asking for anything in return. Why? Because others did it for me when I started to play. Don\\'t know when it started, but this mindset really is helpful for new players or vet players working up an alt. The forums and redit and great places to go for information and if you want to mention something.\\n\\n-:::Money Stuffs:::-\\nFirst, the base game is $20 (USD) with NO subscription cost required. The base game is loaded with content on it\\'s own. There are free-to-play events that last for about a week or two. During the event, usually the base game is even cheaper. Micro transactions exist and expansions will cost extra, but you don\\'t need to spend an extra dime when you start to play. If you want to get a ESO plus membership...you\\'ll mainly do it for the Crafting Bag! You can pay for one month, farm your behind off, toss it in the bag, and you will still have access to the materials even as a non member. Personally, I don\\'t let my membership drop. I have enjoyed Bethesda games for many, many years and I believe in their mission statement as a company. This is my way of supporting them. In truth, I have spent roughly hundreds in a combination of micros/Xpacs/ESO Prime memberships. If you have a tattoo that says \"No Regrets\", give your tat a double pat, because it is how I feel about the money I have spent.\\n\\n-:::The gameplay:::-\\nUghhh...where to start...\\nThere is so much to do in the game. 1200+ hours and I still have things to do and explore. It\\'s mind blowing! Each zone has unique story lines and quests/daily quests with awesome rewards. There is the main quest, which I recommend before doing anything else. It will get you attuned to the game mechanics, your race/class/weapon types/armor, and learn some awesome lore along the way. The character creation and race/class/weapon/armor combinations are endless. Pick the Race and Class you find that most speaks to you, but let\\'s face it, you\\'ll eventually want to build alts to see what else is awesome!\\n\\n-Character-\\nThe max level is 50, and more growth with Champion Points after capping. Character creation is just as in depth as any Elder Scrolls game. While questing, sometimes your race or class can trigger a line in NPCs to make it more immersive. Each race and class has their own special abilities and passives. There are the \"End-Game\" builds for grrrr dps, beefy tanking, and poofy Healing, but you can customize your play style for questing and solo-work in your way. Example? Hmmm? Dragon Knight...usually seen as a tanking class using one/two handed weapons with shields while breathing fire, throwing rocks, battle screaming, and jumping into battle like a Barbarian Berserker in DND, but...go ahead...equip a bow or a staff and do those same things and go Ham if you want to. Possibilities are endless for each combination of race, class, weapon and armor types.\\n\\n-Content-\\nBethesda is continuously adding new content and revisiting the game to keep it fresh and fun. They just revamped Champion Points...I haven\\'t delved into the new system enough to make a bias comment, but I can say this; \"HOLY CANNOLI BATMAN\", there is great potential and growth for your character in the new system for PVE and PVP. There is usually a new expansion every year and it is treated like a year-long event with a prologue quest, updates, and things to do that get you ready for what is coming. As with most MMOs, there are also seasonal events like the New Life Festival (my favorite), Jester Festival, Witches Festival, Midyear Mayhem...just to name a few. All have great rewards, quests, and things to do. They add to those rewards each year!\\n\\n-PVP-\\nYou into PVP? Good, cause I\\'m not (lol). I can\\'t accurately comment on PVP, because I am mainly a questing player trying to build his own home. That said, I can say this; It\\'s a typical MMO PVP experience with dailies and stuff, but it has quite a few modes to choose from with unique objectives! Wish I could comment more, but maybe once I join a guild, I\\'ll team up with those who can teach me the ways of ESO PVP. I\\'ll edit this when that happens.\\n\\n-Guilds-\\nAnother area I can\\'t accurately comment on, but what do guilds have in them? People! The Players! Look online about people in their guilds, no matter the game. No matter the size of the guild (and they can get big) they have long lasting friendships built with others they have met. Example I can give is my WoW days. I still talk to my old Guild Master and friend. She is like my Big Sister in a way and we live states apart! The people you meet in your guild could bring you joy. Meet with them and become family! Learn with them! Fight with them! FOR THE HOR...sorry, wrong game...the family aspect still applies though. No matter your race or banner you join, your guild could be that family you were looking for.\\n\\n-Homes-\\nYes, you can buy homes in ESO, just like in previous games. Buying homes makes them account wide, so your alts will be able to go into those same homes. Some players have built their own home. I am currently doing this and it is a massive undertaking, but I am enjoying it! You can even invite other players and guild mates into your home! \"Say What!?\". If that\\'s not cool, then how about this. Your non-combat pets and mounts...you can set paths for them to walk or fly while you are in your house...Awesome! There are so many furniture items to collect and showcase. Get enough of them and you’ll eventually need more than one home to place them in!\\n\\n-:::Conclusion:::-\\nI have had so much fun doing it solo, but this solo player is looking for a guild now. Like I said above, Richest, Immersing, and Positive community driven. You have all to gain and only a few hours to lose to download and give it a proper go. There is way too much to say about the game and so much more I want to say about individual aspects. You can download it on PS, Xbox, and PC. Just to be clear, cross-play is not a thing, but PC is where I am at. Come play and have some fun! Go! Go do it! Download! Yeeeesssss!!! Download it!! Jump into Tamriel with us and have fun!!!',\n",

       "  'review': 'As a player with 7500 Hours into this who dedicated time to helping others progress harder content, form fantastic bonds with friends and enjoyed the game for long time. I can no longer recommend it, here is breakdown of reasons I have been as formal as possible:\\n\\n(1) Performance: Plethora of game malfunctions affecting core mechanics of game such as recently after update, where basic combat functions don’t operate. Alliance war and PvP combat  is neglected, you can’t seem to walk few steps without delay and fluidity is bad. Is it too much to ask for a working function?\\n\\n(2i) Attitude: This is a big issue for me. Ignoring feedback, venturing into disrespectful rancour to players through social media platform. This is often met with deaf ears and even lambasted again on social media. Successful games listen and grow with their community not cage them and laugh at them.\\n\\n(2ii) Communication: Simply and unanimously non existent. Refusing to justify sweeping changes, and radio silence.\\n\\n(3) Store focus: Lately have made a huge jump in arming this  element of game, focus is your Pennies not you as a player.\\n\\nHowever I will leave a positive. One of if not the best communities you’ll ever bond with, welcoming, supportive and accepting. Could not ask for a better friendship group than one I have here. They know who they are and I’ll be forever thankful.\\n\\nThank you all for reading.\\n\\n=====================================\\n\\nUPDATE as of 26/01/2023:\\n\\nAs many likely notice I’ve started to play more avidly again. Though there are still some gaps and answers to be addressed the latest chapter reveal looked very nice and a much wanted new element was added: A Class. And Over Xmas when I spent a hiatus away improvements in communication thanks to the hard working content makers of this game. \\n\\nI will for now keep the thumbs down but this frown could be turned upside down soon if new hardware promised improves quality of life and if the Developers stick to their word. And final word on matter the community seems closer knit than before which is very enlightening given what happened between November and December. Thank you all, let’s see if the promises live up to what’s been asked for and expected!',\n",

It's best to get a head start before the content drops!\\n\\n[h3][b]Gameplay[/b][/h3]\\nThe Elder Scrolls Online, which I shall refer to as ESO, is a popular open-world MMORPG developed by ZeniMax Online Studios, and allows its players to explore a vast amount of Nirn during an unfamiliar time period in the Elder Scrolls universe.\\n\\n[i][b]Play as you see fit[/b][/i]\\nOne of the best features of ESO which I highly commend is its easy accessibility to all players. That isn't to say that the game is easy - rather, it doesn't punish new players for mistakes they may make in the early stages of the game. Trust me, I myself made countless mistakes across a few characters before really getting a foothold. The learning curve may be a bit steep, but the early stages aren't absolutely brutal on new players. Feel free to put your character points into whatever you deem fit - you can always respec your points cheaply later on when it really matters.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975511257\\n\\nI'm not the best person to go to in terms of advice for beginners; there are plenty of in-depth beginner guides that can help you off your feet. But if you like going in blind as I did, know that it's never too late to follow a build. Furthermore, ESO is available to play in two main ways, PVE (player vs environment) and PVP (player vs player). I personally stick to the PVE aspects of the game, notably dungeons, delves and questing. I haven't quite gotten to the raids yet.\\n\\nChoose your role (Damage Dealer, Tank or Healer), set up your skill bar and prepare for battle. I've heard mixed reviews of ESO's combat system, but I personally have no problems with it and enjoy combat. Furthermore, there are currently six playable classes (four of which are available for free with the base game), ten races (nine of which are available for free with the base game), and thousands of unique viable builds to choose from for your gaming pleasure.\\n\\n[i][b]Puts the Massive in Massively Multiplayer[/b][/i]\\nOne of my biggest gripes with ESO, that is also simultaneously one of my favourite features of the game, is its ridiculously massive world that is incredibly easy to get lost in. But with great power (huge 3D world with nice models, fully voice-acted characters, etcetera) comes great responsibility - in the form of 100-odd gigabytes on my hard drive. You read that right: over 100 glorious gigabytes of disk usage.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975507520 \\n\\nOn the other hand, ESO is also massively multiplayer in the sense that it is still very much alive. Unfortunately, the game isn't cross-platform, but on NA PC you still see other adventurers *mostly* wherever you go. The community is also *mostly* friendly, with many guilds waiting to welcome you in with open arms. By the way, you can be a member of up to FIVE different guilds, so there's really no excuse not to make some friends.\\n\\nIf you're the type of player who likes playing through content by yourself, don't worry. You're not alone. You can play through the majority of ESO's content, sans high-tier PVE challenges.\\n\\n[h3][b]Story[/b][/h3]\\nIn my humble opinion, ESO is one of the best MMORPG story content-wise. I used to be the type of player who would skip through dialogue and cutscenes to get straight to the combat. Eventually, though, I started taking the time to listen to the fully voice-acted dialogue. Some quests are certainly better than others, but overall the quests are of good quality. I highly recommend you level your main character through questing rather than grinding. Not only do you get to experience the quest, but you can also get unique rewards and lots of XP.\\n\\n[h3][b]Audio and Visuals[/b][/h3]\\nESO is a great looking game and is again one of the best MMORPGs visual-wise in my opinion. I'll admit, there are definitely some meshes that look better than others (outlier examples), but for the most part, the game looks great. I really enjoy riding on my mount from point-to-point rather than just teleporting. The better rig you have, the better the game looks. The soundtrack is also superb, and as I've mentioned, the dialogue is fully voice acted.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1975507736\\n\\n[h3][b]Value[/b][/h3]\\nIn terms of the base game, which frequently goes on sale, there are hundreds of hours of content available with no other purchases, microtransactions or otherwise. \\n\\n[i][b]The Business Model[/b][/i]\\nOn the other hand, there is also a plethora of paid DLCs, expansions, and microtransactions available in ESO's Crown store. The game's premium currency, Crowns, can be traded among players in the form of gifting items in exchange for gold. This is often done through middlemen and can be risky. ZeniMax offers no other form of currency exchange. There also exists a paid membership, ESO Plus, which is not required for the base game, that grants subscribers unlimited access to all DLC (excluding new expansions), a number of crowns and other benefits.\\n\\nAgain, the aforementioned microtransactions are not at all necessary for hundreds of hours of enjoyment, but I myself have made purchases on the Crown store and am currently an active ESO+ subscriber.\\n\\n[h3][b]Bugs/Issues[/b][/h3]\\nIn the actual game itself, you don't run into issues all too often. I experience the occasional crash, but this may not necessarily be due to ESO. Regarding server performance, however, much of the community have raised complaints about the poor performance of the games servers and matchmaking capabilities specifically. This problem mostly applies to those interested in PVP, however, problems do exist with the Dungeon Finder (hit-or-miss queue times).\\n\\nIn general PVE play, especially if you're sticking with the overworld content, you shouldn't experience many problems. If necessary, restart your game every few hours to keep the memory usage low.\\n\\n[h3][b]Performance[/b][/h3]\\nMy computer (see below) has no problems running ESO at high settings, however, I acknowledge that for lower-end rigs you may encounter difficulty in running the game. Make sure to check the minimum specifications, and if your PC has equivalent or better parts. The in-game settings menu allows you to customize the graphics settings to suit your needs.\\n\\nCPU: i7-8750\\nGPU: GTX 1060\\nRAM: 16GB DDR4\\n\\n[h1][b][u]In Closing:[/u][/b][/h1]\\n[i][b]Greymoor is coming.[/b][/i]\\nThe Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited is one of the best MMORPGs currently available on Steam. Play how you want in the game's expansive world, against other players or enemies, and prepare yourself for the Dark Heart of Skyrim.\\n\\n[h3][b]Rating: Good[/b][/h3]\\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/deviationreviews/discussions/2/1750148445265154792/]Click here to view my complete rating chart, and what this rating means.[/url]\\n\\n[quote]Like the review?

       "  'review': 'first, please pardon me for the grammar error\\nsecond, i played this game about 40+ hours now, and just only get lvl 20, so i don\\'t really have any experience with the  end-game content yet, but i\\'ll talk about negative and positive side of this game that i experience through out my journey\\n\\npositive side :\\n1. storyline and storytelling system\\nfor an MMORPG, this game got really good storyline, zenimax not only concentrate on the main-quest storyline, but also on the side quest, about 90% of the side quest i\\'ve done got really great dialogue and very interesting story, most of them always revolve around TES series lore, which is really interesting by itself\\n\\nand so far 100% of all quest i done are voice acted, it adding the immersive-ness of the game, and help the player with \"tl;dr\" problem \\n\\n2.Quest system\\nas i said, questing here really fun, not feels much like a chore because of the story they offer\\n\\nand also this game give you multiple choice in some side quest, which will effect you gameplay and the outcome of the quest, its quite rare to find this kind of feature in other MMO\\n\\n3.Job System\\nyou practically can be whatever you want, wanna be a tank-mage? you can, or a warmage?, you can of course, every job can access all weapons and armor, so you can customize your character whatever you want what will suit your gameplay\\n\\n4.Skill System\\nif you ever played GW2, skill system here rather similar BUT much more interesting and complex, because you got a lot of skill to upgrade, and you can choose whatever skill you want, theres your basic job skills, racial skills, world skills, weapon skills etc, and when 1 skill already achieve max level, some of them you can transform it into much more powerfull version of it, create your own skill combo\\n\\n5.World Design\\nindeed probably the world design not as detail/as beautifull like other MMORPG especially P2P MMORPG like FF14, but it fit the theme really well, theres variations in each area and faction which fit the lore and add make the game much more immersive, i find my self waste hourse just for exploring the world :))\\n\\n6.Gameplay\\nwell imagine skyrim/TES series with classic MMORPG skill, thats practically what you get, it\\'s fun, at first probably need a little bit adaptation, but when you get hang of it, its fun even though probably not as fast paced as you imagine, but TES series never been a fast paced action RPG genre\\n\\n7. Economy system\\nnow, this part that i really like, there is no public auction whatsoever, you can trade/get some kind of auction, but only through a guild, thus in this game you could join up to 5 guilds\\n\\nwith this system, you can cross trading between guilds, looking for best price to buy and sell on each region, really reminds me of XIAN online type of economy, dynamic controlled by player\\n\\nnow, let switch to the negative side of the game :\\n\\n1. the soundtrack\\nIMHO, theres no single memorable soundtrack in this game, in FF14 i always remember which soundtrack belong to which area, but here....every music feels the same, theres like no identity at all for each music.\\n\\n2. the character creation\\nthe character creation too shallow imho, theres no clear different between each slide bar for every part of the character body, thus i can\\'t made the character i really want even though i waste 30-50 minutes creating it\\n\\n\\ntl;dr -> The Elder Scrolls Online : It sucks no more, highly reccomended for everyone :)',\n",

       "  'review': \"I don't know where to start with this review but I want to say that this has been a game I keep coming back to and now currently play as my main MMO. I picked it up between the Legion and BFA expansions of WoW as a game to kinda dip my toes into. Now it's my main MMO and I'm in love with this game and all aspects of it. Well...most aspects, not all\\n\\nThe combat feels deep and rewarding with a plethora of ways to handle building your character. You can try all types of creative and fun builds without the worry of being a parse monkey (unless you're going for the highest level of progression). The only bad part is the fact abilities sometimes fail to fire off which can be frustrating. Pls fix the bugs, ZoS.\\nThe open world is the best of any MMORPG with how the game utilizes its world. All quests are voice acting, all NPC's are voiced. The questlines in the game are amazing.\\n\\nI love the PvP even if it can be frustrating in its performance lately. But there's no game that feels quite like this one. Most people write off PvP because the skill gap and don't know why they are dying. But I promise if you take the time to learn the fundamentals and mechanics of it, you might fall in love as well.\\n\\nDungeons: Best dungeons of any MMO hands down. Maybe not the base game stuff, but the DLC dungeons on veteran and vet hard mode are incredible.\\n\\nTrials/Raids: The only part of the game I can't speak to the quality of because I don't have the patience to be on a raid team. I enjoy the dungeons and the pvp and that's enough for me.\\n\\nArenas: Amazing solo and group arenas exist with tons of awesome rewards and weapons\\n\\nCharacter building: This game is a true RPG in how you kit out your character and play specific builds. You'll find out when you play\\n\\nThe bad: Crown store. Stay so far from it, it is predatory to new players and half the stuff on it shouldn't be on it. Even worse, the crown crates rely on FOMO to get you to buy them. Please do not buy them. I am a hypocrite for saying this because I've bought them, but I'm the exact player they're preying on it with. I know I shouldn't buy them yet I do.\\n\\nESO Plus is also pushed on you pretty hard as a new player because you won't have a craft bag and won't have access to any of the DLC content. Fear not new players. When starting the game. DO NOT pick up crafting materials while on non-sub account. Instead, use the time to put items on research because you can't even really use those materials unless you have things researched. So research while exploring the game and playing at your own pace. Craft later\\n\\nI've rambled on long enough. This review is unorganized\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Your expectation of The Elder Scrolls® Online: Tamriel Unlimited™ should first and foremost be that of an MMO, not an Elder Scrolls game. While the game does have the lore and basic 'dumbed down' aesthetic of The Elder Scrolls it lacks the atmosphere. What I mean is it does not draw you into the lore and entice you as does it's single player cousins. Rather, you find yourself mindlessly fighting through zone to zone, quest to quest, dungeon to dungeon with no genuine interest in its lore or atmosphere. This is a hugely common trait to an MMO and not something the Elder Scrolls is known for bringing.\\n\\nThat being said it's by no means a bad game or MMO. In fact, it's outstanding. The combat loosely resembles The Elder Scrolls and has a fairly decent spectrum of play styles between the classes. PVP in ESO is a breath of fresh air but can soon become stale and has a hugely disadvantages experience curve in the start.\\n\\nTo summarize, you'll find yourself trying to delve in and love this game as you would the world of The Elder Scrolls. However, you should not add this to your library simple because it wears The Elders Scrolls 'cloak' as you may be disappointed. As an MMO, it's fantastic and fairly unboring but does leave much to be desired despite its large amount of content. \\n\\nIf you are looking for a good MMO that wears The Elder Scrolls aesthetic and features a few new treats to the MMO scene then this may be the game for you. If you are looking for a multiplayer skyrim then you will be sorely disappointed.\\n\\n7.5/10\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Review after a long long play time\\n\\nAs you can see i am pretty busy trying to complete the Game with all its content. After 2k + hrs. i think i am able to do a Review.\\n\\nYes i played other Es Games. I started with Skyrim as it came out, i loved it. i also tryed Oblivion after that and the last game before i  went to Eso was Morrowind. All games have 1 in common. the Absolut freedom from the very beginning. After you finished the Prologue you will be gently released into a huge open world Area. The ammount of quests you can find in eso is absurd. Its things like \" Bringe me this Staff or kill that Monster \" But there are also Mainquest lines in every Map you can explore ( yes the maps are connected to eachother and you can travel them even by foot. ) These quests can get very long. maby you need 1 or 2 days to complete them. 2 lvl systems are ingame. once you hit lvl 50 you start over with the so called cp system ( Campion Points ) its similar to the skyrim skilltrees from the look. the cp point system gets up to cp lvl 690 right now. every point is a powerfull passive you can connect to eachother to build your own char as you like. Want a Tank who can heal just with 1 weapon bar swap ? go for it. Ant there comes the point where all gets much more interesting. The endgame: I have never played a Game with so much Endgame content as eso. once you hit cp 160 ( which is max gear lvl ) you can start to build up your own Warrior. There are many sets. 5 pice sets, 3 pice stes 2 pices and even 1 pice sets. all of these Items can be combined as you wish, to experiment and build up. Some sets can be crafted, others need to be found. The grinding aspect isnt that bad in eso. There was a update , not long ago. now we all can transmute the Traits from all our weapons and Armor as we like. No more farming 1 dungeon 100 times because the dagger you want just dropps in training. Some dungeons can be extremly brutal, even with a good groupe. ( up to 12 man raids ) 80 % of the game can be beaten very easy, but if you wana min max and bring out the best in your char you have to face greate evil.\\n\\nThe next thing i wana talk about is the pvp system. Everyone hwo played Oblivion will know the place very well. Huge battles are going on in Cyrodiil for the fight of the Emperor title. 3 Allianz Teams build a triangle in the map ( wich is abnormal huge for pvp. so train your horse in speed ) the main goal is to dominate arrount the Imperial city. capure as many castles as you can and hold them. This can be buggy to a point where you are not able to play the game . loading screens of death ( unending loading screen ) if a fight between 200 + players breakes out the fps dropps so low you cant even attack... well thats really a - Point in my opinion. But there are other fine Options where you can battle other players. the imperial city itselfe is a battleground and is very stable. the whole city has a huge dungeon system blow the ground where you can battle too. Battlegrounds ar a new form of 4v4v4 Battles. Normal modes like deathmatches, capture the flag and so on can be played here. A very interesting point is the fighting mecanics. rolldoge, block and weapon swaps in the fights allow you for offensive and deffensive manouver at the same time. even animation cnceling is possible, which allowes good players to nearly double the dps or hot you can dish out. Shure there is and will always be a meta, but it changes and after a while you will know that in eso skill matters. its not just the sets and weapons that makes a good fighter. it takes months to really handle a 2h sword the right way. \\n\\nthe marked system is a whole dimension in itselfe. there are hundreds of traiding Guilds ingame. every guild can hold up to 500 players i think or 600.  you can have 5 guilds at the same time in evry guild you have 30 slots for selling your stuff. some people play the game just because of the marked. ( Master merchant addon is a must have for traiding )\\n\\nThe community is very nice and friendly. no pay to win at all. the whole real money store stuff is just for the looks.\\neso + is another thing. i dont think you need it but it is very awesome. you have no storage problems at all and you can travel to dlcs you dont have in your game. there is a festival once every year where you can try out eso + for free. a whole week. try it first for free and if you cant be without it just do it then.\\n\\nAll in all i wnat to say this game has a huge potential and it uses it the right way. shure the game has bugs, lots of them, but its nothing else like skyrim or oblivion. if you can handle the bugs from the older games you can handle the bugs from eso too. nothing that whould spoil your fun. Lots of content as i said before and much to come in the next time. ( my personal tipp: grab the gold edition when its on sale ) and try out a RPG you wont foget.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played this game for the past 3 years and would not recommend it. I would like to start with the positive aspects first.\\n\\n[h1] Pros\\t[/h1]\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]ESO has great graphics for an MMO, and the environments look amazing. Its possible to use Reshades to make the game look even better to look at. The cities are really big and its possible to visit most the interiors of most buildings.\\n\\n    [*]The world feels very alive as there are players everywhere, in every zone even the most outdated ones. It makes it easy to find people to do activities such as world bosses.\\n\\n    [*]In game community is often helpful, lots of people have helped me out when I was new, but the endgame community can be toxic.\\n     \\n    [*]The dungeons are fun and have some cool mechanics. They each have a story in them and also each dungeon is unique and the bosses are quite challenging. I had a lot of fun playing them with friends.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1] Neutral\\t[/h1]\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]The story and questing is one of the biggest aspects of ESO, and I have mixed feelings about it. Some of the zones have really interesting and engaging story lines, such as Grahtwood and Orsinium, but I found most of it boring. The main story quests of most zones are ok doing it once but it lacks replay value since there are no actual choices you can make that affects the story to a large degree. Most of the choices left to the player are really small and they mostly show up in side quests. I don't like the side quests most of the time because its often about helping someone who really doesn't have any proper background and isn't interesting, and the quest bosses are highly repetitive and too easy to kill.\\n\\n    [*]The soundtrack is good I guess but I feel that the best tracks are remastered from the previous Elder Scrolls games. I found  the combat music to be pretty annoying.\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1] Cons\\t[/h1]\\n[list]\\n    [*]I found the combat to be awful, mainly because of animation canceling as well as the combat feeling floaty. So the animation canceling is when you can perform a light attack between abilities. All skills have a one second GCD, but light attacks are on a different timer, which causes this issue. Animation canceling increases DPS by a lot and its essential in endgame content. It requires a significant amount of skill to perform correctly, but it just isn't any fun. What's more is that it makes the character look like they're having a seizure, and it clearly isn't an intended feature. The game makes no mention of this anywhere, but if someone wants to do any endgame content they need to be able to do it, as otherwise most guilds will not consider them.\\n\\n        Another issue is the champion system, its meant to be the endgame progression system. There are 810 points to obtain in total, and they are obtained by just gaining exp. But the system is boring and it just offers something like +1% damage or +1% magicka recovery and stuff like that. There are no class new abilities added with this system and it isn't really fun for endgame progression.\\n\\n    [*]Classes feel too similar to each other. ESO has 6 classes, but there exists two variations of each class, magicka and stamina. The stamina version wan't intended by the developers(I think) because there currently is stamina sorcerer and stamina necromancer which don't make much sense. But due to the way abilities work it was found that stacking stamina in builds results in being able to do good dps as well. The problem is that every single class has the same types of abilities, just with different colors and effects. Every class has a similar ground based DOT, one spammable, one buff which grants increased damage, one defense ability which boosts armor and so on. When performing dps rotations, every class plays almost the same due to this. But some classes are tweaked every patch which keeps shifting the meta, so one needs to have every dps class available.\\n\\n    [*]PVP is too laggy and not fun or balanced. The PVP in this game was intended to be a major aspect, however these days it seems to be neglected. The game was supposed to support 200 vs 200 battles, but even with 20 people on the screen it starts to lag and sometimes gets disconnected. FPS also drops, however the game doesn't use a lot of system resources either. Its also unpredictable to tell what enemy players are casting because of the combination of animation canceling and lag. The PVP isn't balanced in the sense that sometimes one faction has way less players than the other one. Also some classes are just better in every way than other classes, and some sets are overpowered.\\n\\n    [*]Endgame trials(raids) are also laggy, and the trial design is bad in my opinion. There are only three or four bosses in each one of them, and there is too little trash mobs in between bosses. Bosses have some interesting mechanics but it just isn't very fun due to the poor combat, lag and low fps. Trials also don't drop very powerful gear which is worth chasing after or any cool cosmetics.\\n\\n     [*] Too much focus on crown store. The game is very hard to play without the monthly subscription as inventory space is highly limited. Even after subscribing, too many things are pay walled, such as mounts, pets and housing. The monthly crowns which are provided are so little that its possible to only buy a pet or a costume. The game has 95% of mounts pay walled with no other way to get them. The better mounts are kept in the loot crates which use another currency system called crown gems, and the coolest mounts are called as radiant apex rewards which cannot be obtained with even crown gems and must be gambled for. Housing in this game is really fun and its possible to make all sorts of structures, but its so ridiculously overpriced, the best houses are crowns only, and even then the best furniture is sold exclusively through the crown store.\\n\\n        The problem with this is that there is very little incentive to play through the game and collect stuff. And now even skill lines and skill points will be sold through the crown store. Skill lines are an important part of the game because they have important passives which are needed in more difficult content, but they are grindy and boring to level up. It literally takes a 100 hours to grind all the skill lines such as mages guild, undaunted, psijic order and to collect every skyshard to unlock all the abilities on one character. Many players have asked for it to be account wide, but in the end the solution is sold through the crown store. So the crown store isn't limited to cosmetics only, there are game play impacting items as well. I would call it pay 4 the convenience 2 win or something like that( p4c2w :)).\\n[/list]\\n\\nI wouldn't recommend this game due to these reasons, as the game is slowly being designed with only the cash shop in mind. I've spent a lot of time and money on this game and I regret it a lot. I mainly maxed out my all of my characters skill lines and skyshards, as well as spent many hundreds of hours becoming a master crafter. Almost everything is available for purchase through the crown store these days, its so bad that its possible to become a master crafter in just a couple of minutes with the crown store. I would only advise this game for TES fans who may be interested in playing the story casually, because as an MMO its just not that good for the amount of time and money that it asks.\",\n",

Because the developers are more interested making money via re-skinning the same old crap in the crown store, than they are in fixing the many, many bugs. Newer content comes out? So do new bugs. Patch updates or maintenance? More new bugs. Fix certain bugs? Break something else instead. And not fix it for ages, if ever. Because, y'know, crown store shinies more important.\\nAdd to that the incompetent and clueless customer service (e.g. expecting me to acknowledge T&C/TOS in a language that was _never_ selected as my own; ridiculously long gaps in addressing forum concerns) and the ongoing price for having such basics as a crafting bag, etc. Why keep paying over and over for a game that is this broken, with crappy developer service, when there are other games you can enjoy for a one-off price?

       "  'review': \"I have played this game quite some bit.  I recently decided to knock it down to one night a week. Getting burned out.  ALl in all, I feel this is the best MMO out.  \\n\\nFirst the pros:  Big world, fights are fast paced and veteran level content is unforgiving for those who like to not dodge mechanics.  The graphics are beautiful for it's age.   Community as a whole is great.  Most people are very very helpful and nice (although getting them to talk with a mic is like asking them to swallow glass!).  The population of the community feels great after 1 tam came out.\\n\\nNow the cons.  There are a ton of bugs in the game.  None that are game breaking, but they do get annoying.  Customer service is a joke.  Bad class balancing.  Used to be magic based characters were overpowered.  Now it is the stamina based versions of the same classes.  The downfall is all the stam based characters feel VERY generic and lack uniqueness (literally 80% of stam based skills are the same across classes).  The magic based characters feel much more unique in their abilities, but their performance took a big hit after Dark Brotherhood (you can play them, but there is a noticable difference).  When it comes to loot, it literally are running the same content over and over and over and over hoping your piece drops with the right configuration on it.  The content for me, got old quick after clearing vet material.  You are basically reduced to a chimp pulling a lever 500 times for a piece of candy.  Some people really like the PVP, but it wasnt for me.  \\n\\nHopefully this helps you decide if it is right for you.  If you like MMOs, and dont expect Skyrim!, check it out.  I think you will pleasantly surprised until the you eventually get bored.  That will take awhile though!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"What we have here is a bit of a mess. Which is a shame as underneath that mess there is a good game, not a great game but not a dud either. The problem is that its been updated and had DLC added without much (or perhaps any) care in making that mesh with what's there already.  Crashes occasionally too. \\n\\nSo mess first. If this does not matter to you then this could be the game for you. It is fun, I like it, but…\\n\\nWhere you start will depend on if you have purchased any of the DLC with the game as part of a pack. For example if you get Elsweyr and Morrowind then you will start in one of those areas, rather than where the main quest kicks off. This would not be so much of an issue if the DLC did not happen after the events of the main quest and there weren’t massive spoilers relating to main quest characters in the DLC. Morrowind is more or less self contained, but Elsweyr isn’t and several main quest characters turn up there, with one in particular having a colossal spoiler. \\n\\nSoo... Just avoid the DLC areas right? Except unless you do a ‘net search you have no idea where the main quest starts, or how to start it. Its a big game with a big map and you have to do one tiny specific thing to start the main quest – actually you have to do two. If you’ve played it; think of the trigger for those darn Oblivion gates in Oblivion as an example. Even when you are in the main quest you still hit Back-to-the-Future moments with NPCs who cannot possibly be wondering around - as for example they are nailed to a wall in a prison cell somewhere - coming up to you and offering you quests. Or the same NPC being in 3 different places at once in the same quest or NPCs just apparently warping around the place to talk to you and yet still being in other places and also being in the DLC while they are nailed to a wall in a prison cell so yeh its a bit of a mess. \\n\\nThere are free prologue quests which lead into the DLC, but one will break the main quest completely if you start it.  You have to abandon the prologue quest to start the main one up again – if you are lucky. It didn’t work for me so I had to complete the 1st part of the prologue and then abandon subsequent one to get the main quest back. However unless you start wondering why a particular NPC hasn’t pestered you for ages and then ‘net searched (again) you’d never know there was a problem. Oh the quest you need to abandon is [spoiler]demon weapon [/spoiler] which is the prologue to [spoiler]Elsweyr[/spoiler].\\n\\nThen there are places where the devs just didn’t think things though. I had one quest where you had to rescue some folk and one of them also wanted me to find something. Having rescued them and found the thing I then discovered I could not talk to the NPC who wanted the thing as all the folk I rescued were in the way.\\n\\nThe map is split into PVE (most of it but you can challenge players) and PVP (Cyrodiil). Now I don’t tend to PVP but had to visit Cyrodiil to find something. It was not fun. Whether it was my internet playing up at just that time or what I don’t know but I kept getting micro loading screens as I wondered around the map – not a problem in other areas. As a result when I did bump into another player I was instantly cheesed (like being creamed, but with a more piquant aftertaste) as I micro-loading screened. OK I would probably have died anyway but it didn’t help.\\n\\nFinally there is the game’s history. When launched you picked a faction and could only play in that faction's area and Cyrodiil. Then the PVE map was opened up so you can play anywhere – your main quest just starts in your faction’s area but you can quest anywhere on the map. Except… The quests were not updated, so as a result you now fight your own faction’s NPCs in some areas of the map. I’m not sure how this could have been fixed, but given so little else has been, I’m not surprised. A little note here added after I completed a rather long quest - don't read unless you want a spoiler. [spoiler] This is explained once you have completed the main quest, why you can wander into the other factions areas and not get smashed to a pulp by the guards when you do. Except you can now do this anyway before you complete the main quest. So yeh...[/spoiler]\\n\\nSo can you ignore the above? Well mostly. Its annoying and immersion breaking so if that’s important to you look elsewhere. If it isn’t then don’t look  Elsweyr until you’ve done the main quest. As a game the graphics are good, not 2020 quality but fine for an MMO. Rain stays outside buildings, even if people don’t get wet and it doesn’t splash on water. Fog is suitably murky, spells flashy - perhaps too flashy if you play 1st person - and the animals (not so much the horses) look and move fairly realistically - as do the bipeds. well as realistically as giant winged demons might. The voice acting ranges from the usual bored person saying words to very good – particularly the majority of the Khajiit (cat people) NPCs. Some of the side quests made me smile and although the main quest is very linier, the other map quests can be completed in any order – just don’t expect the timeline to make a lot of sense if you do. NPCs generally do not know they have spoken to you before and will happily tell you their life story again. Equally sometimes the devs will assume that you have spoken to someone before and the NPC will leave out some info resulting in wtf moments.\\n\\nJust to round on the DLC again. The DLC chapters (Morrowind, Elsewyr etc) sort of follow on from each other. For example there’s Morrowind, the Clockwork city and then (no you have to buy the Clockwork city from the in game store you cannot get it as part of a Steam pack - no I don't know why either) Summerset. \\n\\nQuests tend to be hack-and-slash with puzzles in a few (not very many at all). If you like a puzzler and less action then this may not be the game for you. Also most crooked NPCs are obviously crooked - not much need for the Spidey sense here.\\n\\nFor an mmo the NPC combat is not bad, its fairly fluid while not being a brawler, and you are not nailed to the ground while you do a special move. Can’t comment on PVP. Some mechanics feel a bit pay to win. Although you buy the game you don’t need a subscription. If you go for one then you get all the DLC unlocked, plus a crafting bag – which holds all the crafting materials and makes inventory management less of the PINTA it can be. If you decide to buy bits over time, say you don’t play enough to make a sub worth it then you can get DLC from the in-game store as well as other stuff. The game and DLC (from the in game store) is sometimes on sale as well.\\n\\nAside from DLC most in-game store stuff is cosmetic, hats, pets, mounts (you get a free horse just by levelling) etc. But there are potions and food which might appear pay-to-win as they buff your char for longer and easier than crafting them or finding them. I don’t mind this, the devs have to eat after all, but you might. You also get a daily gift just by logging on which is generally a random store based buff.\\n\\nThe DLC can be expensive - especially the DLC dungeons, which might put you off and while I don’t PVP, a lot of the PVP community doesn’t sound happy. So if PVP is important then this may not be your game. Read reviews from PVP players and then decide.\\n\\nThere is grind, particularly if you want to progress in the mage’s guild and in crafting where you not only have to hunt for the materials, styles, recipes etc but also have to wait increasingly long times to research new buffs for amour etc. Jewellery is completely locked out without the Summerset DLC and the crown store has instant research scrolls (some of which drop in the daily gift and as part of levelling) that reduce this research by a day. That's a day real time – not game time. Yes sometimes you have to wait a loong time.\\n\\nIts not a bad game, bits are very good and I like it. However I can only recommended if consistent story telling is not that important to you.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'After nearly 4000 hrs, I can say I like the game just a little. Joking aside, this is an MMO that will give you what you put into it. I run one of the largest guilds on the server, I PvPed, PvEed and I even jumped off a few cliffs! Some of the content feels extremely grindy like becoming a mastercrafter and researching for a few months (no exaggeration) gear traits. \\n\\nAll gear in ESO drops with a trait on it and you use your daily research slots (up to 3 with passives) to destroy that item and start a timer that increases over time (up to 9 different traits per an item, last one being about 27 days). Traits for example would be like well-fitted which reduces stamina cost on dodge rolling. This is needed to gain full access to armor/weapon set crafting. Crafted sets are unlocked by the number of traits you know for a weapon/armor category piece. After knowing all 9 you can make anything for that piece (i.e heavy chest). You will definitely get a rewarding sense of accomplishment when you finally finish researching, so start early!\\n\\nYou will also want to visit a stables as early as possible to level your mount for speed, stamina and extra bag space. Unfortunately, without using crown store/daily reward items its 180 days per character (60 times per category, 20 hr waiting per time when you spend 250g at stables). Your mounts fortunately are account wide so you will have wonderful aesthetics from a reward mount on your level 10 alt, riding at the speed of four drunk turtles!\\n\\nGrindy start up parts aside, there is content and a variety of playstyles for everyone. You can build/decorate homes with items (inside existing ones that you buy with gold or crowns), make/buy furniture that you unlocked after leveling professions (crafting), just solo quest and enjoy amazing story arcs in any order. The world of ESO is rich in lore and quite honestly, there is still stuff that surprises me after all these hours. \\n\\nThere is no one way to gear your character, you can do multiple anti-meta builds and still be viable. Do not worry about gear until you reach level 50 and hit CP 160 which is the gear cap (CP is the account wide progression that starts after reaching 50 on your first character). All that being said however, the small price you pay is worth all the content you can enjoy and quite honestly the grind is not in your face like other MMOs. After all my hours, I have only completed half the game so far!\\n\\nFinally, the subscription is completely worth it because that craft bag is worth its weight in gold, you also get access to all the DLCs (not including expansions) and double the space for your bank/home. Did I mention the crowns as well that you can use in the game cash shop? Sure a cash shop is not for everyone but its all cosmetics like with most MMOs, however if you are going to use those crowns get the two inventory pets so you get 10 extra bag spaces. Inventory management is extremely important in ESO which is why you want that craft bag!\\n\\nThanks for reading, I genuinely hope you enjoy the game!',\n",

       "  'review': \"Decent game, I didn't play a lot of it myself though. Just know that once the steam download is done and you open it, it has its own launcher for the game. In the launcher there is another download you have to do that is a decent size. Also just sitting in the launcher increases game time for ESO. So if your download speed isn't crazy good, and you find you don't like the game after it, then you won't be able to refund it.

       "  'review': 'I\\'m an ESO noobie, jumped into the game in Apirl 2020. It\\'s also my first MMORPG ever, although I\\'ve been playing single-player RPGs for 10 years.\\n\\nFirst the positives - as an MMORPG noob I was utterly astonished by the size of the world and the number of things you can do in this game. I did NOT expect anything close to that, and I have just the base game + Morrowind. No DLCs, no other expansions. I can now understand how people can spend years in this game and still have something to do. I also didn\\'t expect how much the social aspect will appeal to me. Running through a dungeon with a group of people can be p. exhilarating. It\\'s a very different experience from something like Skyrim or Witcher but just as great.\\nAnd now for why I stopped playing just after a day. After a few hours of running around the world and having an absolute blast of my life, I started noticing something suspicious - no matter where I go and what I fight I\\'m always doing about the same amount of damage. It took me a few hours to realize this but when I was fighting just some random punks or small monsters it made sense.\\n\\nBut then I stumbled into a group fight with some giant and again, I was doing a lot of damage, while taking barely any. And then I ran into a group of cultists in the forest who summoned a huge lich. And I just melted all of them, solo, just as easily as all the other monsters before.\\n\\nI thought \"wait a minute, how bad is the scaling in this game\". So I googled a bit and oh boy...I learned the entire game is scaled exactly to your level, everywhere and all the time. And not only that - most people seem to be loving it!\\nBut....why? The moment I learned there\\'s not a single challenge anywhere in the world, that every single enemy everywhere will always be a \"trash mob\", my motivation to play this game dropped to zero. What\\'s the point of levelling, of learning all that dizzying array of tools like crafting or alchemy if you never need any of it? With my magical templar, all I ever did was to repeatedly press the \"1\" key to poke monsters with my piercing spear ability, simply because you never need to do anything else. In my 7 hours in the game I\\'ve never died, I\\'ve never even dropped below 50% of my HP. And I\\'ve solved almost all the content too. Running around with a group was even more trivial.\\n\\nHow are people ok with this? I don\\'t mean to bash or criticize anyone for liking a certain style of a game, I\\'m just curious - what is your drive to play this game? In all the dozens of RPGs, I\\'ve ever played the point was to struggle and master all the skills and tools the game was offering to be able to take on harder and harder enemies. What\\'s the main drive in ESO - just to travel around the world, sightseeing and absorb the lore? Don\\'t get me wrong, the world is jaw-droppingly phenomenal and the lore is amazing but is that enough for you? You don\\'t require any challenge in your RPG?\\n\\nSorry for the wall of text but this game gave me such mixed feelings I had to get it off my chest.',\n",

       "  'review': 'What started out as a review turned into a life story.....Once upon a time...\\n\\nI was planning on buying The Elder Scrolls Online (ESO) base game from an online digital marketplace, then maybe pick up the Morrowind chapter later on \"if\" I could get into it. To my surprise when I went to check it out on Steam it was £9.99 \"WITH\" the Morrowind chapter included in the overall price. A nice little surprise. \\nIf you do decide to purchase this game I recommend creating an account on:\\n\\n\"account.elderscrollsonline.com\"\\n\\n first, which you will have to do anyway in order to play the game as it\\'s run through a 3rd party but it\\'s easy enough. Just be aware though the “userid” you choose on the 3rd party site will be the “userid” displayed while you’re in game. \\n\\nAfter I finished downloading the game through Steam I did have a slight issue with the installation... I noticed a few other people who have written a review for this game have also had the same hiccup but it is easily sorted out by \"repairing\" when prompted. Also, another thing to point out, you can play ESO with a controller (I am currently using a wired XBOX controller) if you fancy sitting back and relaxing, while you play on your big T.V then I’d strongly recommend not using KB/M. Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as the conventional “plug and play” you do have to enable it in settings-gameplay. Also, like Skyrim you can toggle from first to 3rd person with the touch of a button.\\n\\nNow on to the best part... The game is truly TRULY beautiful, the colours are vibrant, stand out and feel genuinely warm. The Elder Scrolls Online really does a fantastic job making sure you feel completely immersed in the environment. For me, this is a huge plus! Personally when I am playing a game like this I want to feel like I’m no longer sitting on my sofa, in front of the T.V, I want to feel like I’m actually running around Tamriel, taking in the sights and sounds. This is what I mean when I stipulated I feel “completely immersed” and ESO does a hell of a job creating that escape into that magical fantasy world. \\n\\nAs crazy as this sounds, one of my favourite things about not only this but every game or movie I play or watch is its soundtrack and wow!! The Elder Scrolls Online is on the money again!! In my humble opinion a great soundtrack can make or break a game. Just look at “The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt” as an example, an amazing soundtrack = amazing game… “ELEX” shit soundtrack= shit game LOL (I know these are just my opinions but you get my point lol). ESO’s soundtrack is really something special... I looked into The Elder Scrolls Online soundtrack and they created it over a few YEARS and honestly it truly is a masterpiece. Amazon’s review has it 4.5/5 stars. It gives you this warm sense of nostalgia as it contains music from Skyrim.\\n\\nI was racking my brain thinking what game The Elder Scrolls Online reminded me of… I know I\\'m kinda showing my age a little here but it\\'s a lot like \"Fable 3 crossed with Dragon Age: Inquisition\" with some of the grand designs of some of the buildings and the atmosphere but again this is subjective as it purely my opinion. \\n\\nThe NPC\\'s really blend in well with the environment and are able to create a truly unique atmosphere. Also, NPC\\'s involved in the quests you partake in look amazing when you’re speaking to them. The body language feels genuine and the words are actually synced with the movement of NPC’s lips plus no crazy facial expressions like “Mass Effect Andromeda” LOL. \\n\\n\\nDIFFERENT RACES, FACTIONS & CLASSES\\n\\nAnother aspect I absolutely LOVE about this game is the “freedom of choice” and the “character customisation”. It is head and shoulders above most MMORPG’s on the market today. As far as I’m aware you are able to choose between TEN different races with THREE different factions that looks like this:  \\n\\n“Ebonheart” Pact Faction Races\\n\\nArgonian (Reptilian),  Dunmer (Dark Elves),  Nord (Human)\\n\\n“Aldmeri” Dominion Faction Races\\n\\nAltmer (High Elves),  Bosmer (Wood Elves),  Khajiit (Feline)\\n\\n“Daggerfall” Covenant Faction Races\\n\\nBreton (Human),  Orc (Also known as Corrupted Elves),  Redguard (Human)\\n\\nImperials (Human)  I think you have to purchase the “Imperial Edition of the game” to get access to this class and I think Imperials are able to join “any” faction.\\n\\nCLASSES\\n\\nDragon Knight\\nNightblade \\nTemplar\\nSorcerer\\n\\nhttp://uk.ign.com/wikis/elder-scrolls-online\\n\\nIf any of you guys want more information on Elder Scrolls Online this site has “EVERYTHING” you would ever want to know LOL \\n\\n\\nNOTE\\n I was checking out benchmarks on YouTube so I would have a rough idea what kind of FPS I could expect when I ran into something I think 99.9% of novice, semi and pro gamers would be interested in. Check out \\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKRnY0YLLbc\\n\\non YouTube. The difference between choosing the minimum settings in comparison to the maximum is “Night and Day” TRULY! The textures, terrain, rendering ect are all obviously superior on the highest setting. I personally did the test myself using the R9 390X and can attest & confirm the evidence of the results. As most are aware it obviously depends heavily on what GPU you’re running ESO on but “if” you’re GPU allows you to run ESO on the highest settings I strongly recommend you do as you won’t be disappointed. Also, if you fancy pushing your hardware that little bit further and tweaking your graphical settings to improve your average FPS check this out on google, it’s pretty cool. This is, however, for advanced P.C enthusiasts not novices (No offence intended).\\n\\nhttps://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/368986/mega-thread-eso-performance-tweaks-fps-improvements-stutter-free-graphics-tweaking\\n\\nAs I stipulated above I\\'m running ESO on my R9 390X and FX 8350 OC’ed @ 4.5GHz it truly looks AMAZING. It hardly puts any stress on my GPU at all which in my opinion is particularly impressive as my CPU is ancient (6+ years old) is more than likely bottlenecking my GPU. There is no stuttering, lag, tearing ect and my GPU temps are well within the respectable limits.\\n\\nHonestly, I am struggling to find anything negative about this game... Obviously I am aware that there was a fair amount of problems when the game was initially released back in 2014 but given the amount of time from then to now I think it’s fair to say the patches and updates have done their intended job. One thing I will mention is this game can get REALLY expensive if you let it... True, it’s not a \"Pay to Win\" kinda game in the conventional sense but you do get the feeling with how slowly you acquire gold that it would most definitely be easier to just buy crowns (in-game currency) but that\\'s something you have to search your own soul in deciding if it\\'s worth it.\\n\\nIn my opinion the game is amazing, the soundtrack is amazing and what\\'s more the customisation of your character is also another huge plus. \\n\\nOverall Score:\\n9.6/10 – Amazing!!\\n\\nOne final comment I wish to end with and for me was kind of a make or break, potential deal-breaker was the ESO community… This community, for me is without a doubt the best community I have played online with to date. If you need help and ask 9/10 you get it. An example, I went into a dwarven mine while I was lvl 2 or 3 and kept dying so I asked someone who I had never spoken to before, who was on his/her way out if they could help me. We went back through everywhere they had been before, with me.. So I was able to complete that quest. Proper top draw community!!\\n\\n...The End',\n",

       "  'review': \"Where to start hmm... Came back to ESO after 6 Years, a bunch of things changed, mainly I no longer have stupid fps issues and load screen issues. You will be able to run on max settings in PvE hitting around 100-140 fps (Tweaked the ini file to fix the mouse sensitivity issue) with an RTX 3080. Not sure how bad PvP is because I don't do PVP.\\n\\nHere are my opinions about the game.\\n1. Music. A little biased because I am a fan of game OSTs. ESO's OST are epic and memorable, especially the one when you are doing dolmens. \\n\\n2. Quest and lore. Quests are all fully voice acted, even the side quests. There are tonnes of quest in this game, even if its just the base game. There are 3 different factions but, you can only choose the races under each faction to play unless you have the DLC/addon to have the freedom to select a faction with any race.\\n\\n3. NPCs. One tip for people who love talking to NPCs, make sure to all the quest NPCs before and after submitting the quest. They will have different things to say which makes things lively. \\n\\n4. Activities. Need a break from questing? Try fishing and get the fishing achievements. Heard there's a new card game, might be interesting for people who fancies card games. If not, read the lore books let the lore sink in or just do dungeons.\\n\\n5. PvP. I don't PvP. However, Alliance wars are very very laggy due to really bad server and also the number of players doing it. Imagine a large scale war with 3 factions in the same instance.\\n\\n6. PvE. Quest mobs are easy to kill, quest bosses are also fairly easy. For solo content / questing, I recommend the Two handed skill tree for the temporary shield as it scales based on how many mobs hit in a swing (perfect time to recast buff/heals while soaking dmg.) World bosses are solo-able with a decent build and some resource management. If you want more challenge, try doing Dungeons and Trials.\\n\\n7. Matchmaking. People say its bad and personally, I think its pretty bad. Queue times are long. Your best bet is to go to a highly populated zone like Craglorn, ask in chat to join trials.\\n\\n8. Trials, Dungeons and Arena. Probably the end game goal for PvE to farm for your set items. Normal dungeons are fairly easy with a slight exception of Veteran dungeons. You probably want to gear up and have proper builds and a proper team of 1 tank, 2 damage dealers and a good healer. Trials are larger dungeons that requires 12 players to complete. Each different trials have their own specific mechanics so best you google and study up before joining one. Everyone has their own role in a trial and there are one shot mechanics during their boss fights. People get salty fast when wipes happen and no one is willing to teach and guide newcomers. Arenas like the maelstrom arena is where you can challenge yourself to see how good you are in PvE in terms of Gear, Skill and Resource Management.\\n\\n9. Skill tree. There are 2 kind of trees in game. The actual character skill tree for your class, traits etc. The other one is your end game tree for buffs called the Champion tree. You unlock this tree when you hit level 50. \\n\\n10. Leveling. I'd say the pace is fine for playing casually. If hardcore, you can go from level 1 - 50 in an hour with buffs and gear.\\n\\n11. Learning curve. Not that great for people who never played RPG games. Initial tutorial is fine but after throwing you into the world, it will be the classic way of playing an RPG game which is not that great for people now a days (i guess). I guess in my opinion, people now a days prefer the hand holding in learning the ropes rather than explore on your own kinda thing. This can be daunting for new players like the crafting skill tree in terms of what does it do, how to level them, researching traits, trait crafting etc. Personally I think RPG games are all about exploring what you can do in the world and experiment and theory crafting. Let your imagination run wild and see how far you can go. \\n\\n12. Subscription. My take on the subscription is that if you think you are able to commit playing this MMO for awhile, go for it. If you are just playing casually, you can do without the subscription. The main attractive part about the subscription is the crafting bags. Resources/ materials for crafting will be stored in the premium bag that has unlimited slots. It helps out a lot if you love hording gathered materials during your adventures. If not, the good ol' pack mule characters work, which means you have to worry more about inventory management. 2nd attractive part is that it unlocks DLCs which you don't own. Personally, I think you can do without them if you are playing casually, having fun exploring and killing stuff around. Plus, tonnes of quests for other factions are available for you to complete!\\n\\n13. Server. Two servers are available for your choosing, NA and EU. Pick the one with the best ping and go with it. People in asia playing in NA or EU servers will get from 240 ping to 360 ping. Playable but frustrating if you are very very sensitive about lag. Personally, it didn't bother me much when I'm doing veteran trials and dungeons. It will be a different story in PvP because in PvE, you know what is going on, not in PvP where anything can happen. Zenimax says they are upgrading their EU servers at Q1 2023 but we will see how much of an improvement we get.\\n\\n14. Guilds. There are Role Playing guilds (RP Guilds), PvP guilds, Casual guilds and trader guilds. Join whichever you fancy. I find casual guilds to be the best as there are a mix of players who are knowledgeable, willing to teach and most important of all, friendly, respecting and knows how to have a good time.\\n\\n15. Premium currency. Only spend when you have disposable income. \\n\\nClosing notes ( I guess ?)\\nGreat fall back game to scratch the RPG itch for casual gamers. \\nFor more serious gamers out there where min maxing either makes you happy or go insane, do your due diligence and research about Elder Scrolls Online. Game is simple and very very complicated at the same time.\\n\\nDo I recommend this MMO?\\nYes, unless you are a toxic gamer who doesn't share and teach other players how to do the hard stuff like trials and veteran dungeons. Its an MMORPG. There are casual gamers who just want to have fun. If you want to play with the pros, be the pro and join the pros. Make sure you are their level or you will get treated like how you treat other 'casual' or 'noob' players.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I tried this back when it first came out and left pretty underwhelmed. It wasn\\'t bad, but it was fiddly to the point of irritating, the mechanics were unclear, and the combat seemed dull. I was also playing other games at the time and I wound up drifting away from it after hitting level 12 or so.\\n\\nNow, I\\'m a huuuuuuge Morrowind dork. When the expansion came out, I decided to take the plunge on it if for no other reason than to revisit a game I spent easily a thousand hours on, just to see how it holds up.\\n\\nFirst point to its credit: It does a truly a solid job of recreating the OG Morrowind experience. The map is nearly 1:1 as far as I can tell, though large portions of the middle mountain are inaccessible so the actual playable area is likely much smaller. It doesn\\'t feel that way though; I\\'m easily 30+ hours in on my second attempt and I\\'ve yet to really do anything off the island of Vvardenfell except for some minor sight-seeing. I\\'ve not even touched the base game Main Quest, in true Elder Scrolls fashion, and the game totally allows for this. \\n\\nMore impressively however is that the game fully modernizes Morrowind. Every voice line has full (and well acted!) VO, complete with the actors making admirable attempts to pronounce all of Morrowind\\'s insane dungeon names and Ashlander terms. Everything is much more lush and animated without losing any of the inherent weirdness of Morrowind. Telvanni mushroom towers are now inhabited by active NPCs who adhere to a day/night cycle and will work their jobs. Pages and assistants to the Telvanni mages fritter about talking among themselves. There\\'s a ton of little details that have far more activity going on than the original game was ever able to allow, and it all just works. While it\\'s set 700 years prior to Morrowind 1, there\\'s still plenty of returning NPCs from Morrowind like Vivec and a much younger Divayth Fyr (that Telvanni Mage with the godlike Tower that players would always kill him and inhabit, and which had a dungeon below it (which is now a full-on raid, amusingly enough)). \\n\\nAlso impressively, the single player things you\\'d expect to be removed from an MMO, aren\\'t. You can still pickpocket any NPC you like. Stealth works exactly the same as it does in Skyrim. Shoplifting items is a thing, as is selling stolen items to fences for cash. Bounties are enforced by guards, and just like Morrowind you can either pay them off on the spot or run (jail has been omitted but eh, whatever). \\n\\nBut the thing that\\'s kept me playing is that this game is almost the Anti-WoW. Everything is vastly more complicated, seemingly as an intentional design choice, but unlike the launch version of the game it\\'s now much more *crunchy* instead of needlessly fiddly. You can simply hammer out a few swords in the Blacksmithing profession and call it a day, OR you can dig deep into the system and craft some seriously powerful custom kit if you feel like it. Doing so, however, requires you to drop skill points into the system that could be spent on combat skills instead. Just like the Elder Scrolls games have always done, there\\'s a significant choice to be made about character progression and they\\'ll get better at the things they do more often than not. The complexity is initially pretty staggering but after a while you begin to be able to See The Matrix and the system winds up making perfect sense. \\n\\nThe approach to character level in general is a curious one as well in that there really isn\\'t one. Everything in the game remains at the same base level, and gaining a level is reflected more in your skill points than any kind of base power creep. A wandering Alit becomes only marginally easier to kill at level 30 than it was at level 1, but the difference is that if you\\'ve acquired more skills, you simply have more kit at your disposal; you have to actually USE it, however. The numbers don\\'t automatically get any higher.\\n\\nThis translates to gear being less effective as you outlevel it, making new gear necessary not so much to jack up your power level but to prevent it from falling off. It\\'s...Counterintuitive, but it actually makes a lot of sense and serves the excellent purpose of never gating you off from content because you\\'re not a sufficient level for it. You\\'re ALWAYS a sufficient level for it, and it\\'s always floating at a difficulty point that will provide a challenge. It takes some getting used to and was jarring at first, but now I find myself preferring it to the Dragonball-Style power creep in other RPGs. Smart stuff, if a bit unconventional.\\n\\nLastly, and impressively: This game is monstrously huge. There is an INSANE amount of stuff to do. It puts every other Elder Scrolls game, and honestly any other RPG I can even think of, to absolute shame in terms of sheer Crap To Do™. When you factor in that all of this is fully voiced and animated, the amount of content on display here is jaw-dropping. Wanna explore Elsweyr, the Khajit homeland? How about the Dragontail mountains, not seen since the original Daggerfall? The Gold Coast? Hammerfell? Daggerfall itself? It\\'s all in here and it\\'s super detailed and explorable. \\n\\n~~And it\\'s free.~~ EDIT: I\\'m an idiot, no it isn\\'t, leaving this up because it\\'s the only way I\\'ll learn\\n\\nSeriously. You can opt to pay $15 a month for the \"Crown Plus\" subscription. This is worth it if you plan on delving into the crafting aspect because you get a bottomless crafting item bag (which, believe me, you\\'re GOING to want if you do any crafting), but if you simply want to ignore that aspect in favor of playing through the plot and going on exploration adventures, you can absolutely just play the free base game and be none the worse for wear. If anything, the $15 sub should be considered a Crafting subscription as opposed to anything gating off the proper game. It\\'s incredibly useful for that feature, but really ONLY that feature, and you don\\'t need to do it in order to play the content at all. Scaled item drops will always keep you sufficiently geared and you\\'ll easily have a couple hundred hours worth of content to explore freely without limitation even if you never drop a single cent into the game itself. \\n\\nSo in short, yeah. This is absolutely worth checking out in 2018, and I strongly recommend anyone with a fondness for Morrowind to drop the cash on the Expansion that allows you to play through it and check it out. 100% worth it even if that\\'s all you ever do in the game.\\n\\nIf you do opt to check it out, hit me up in-game. I\\'m on the EU Megaserver (I have no idea why, it\\'s where it put me for some reason) and can be found @DJMalloc. Let\\'s go explore the ash wastes and pick fights with Cliff Racers.\\n\\n(There are still so, so many cliff racers. My god.)',\n",

       "  'review': \"ESO is a fantastic MMO. The community is great, and the game is just stunning. I am an old WOW player from the vanilla days and I remember just going to hilltops or on top of buildings and being in aw of the graphics. I get that feeling again in ESO. Sometimes I just watch the sun set over the water while casting a line in the water. here are some bullet points of why i love ESO.\\n\\n- use any weapon you want. You want to be a greatsword wielding mage with light armor pants but a heavy helm? ok. sure. you want to craft EVERYTHING? ok. You can get all the crafting lines!\\n-such a pretty game as I said above. A well put together world \\n-quests are not boring like go and kill 20 murlocs. There is always a neat story of why you are doing things, and its never just go kill mobs of X monsters. I spent a while last night just pickpocketing people and running from the law to get into the thieves guild. then I killed some people for the assassins' guild. want to just read books? go to a bookshelf and open one up! \\n-LORE. lots of lovely LORE\\n- mostly free. People that complain about expansions costing money don't know how the world works. You can play this game (besides the actual game cost) for free. there is no real need for paying the month script fees unless you want to get cosmetic items for your or your house. BUT that being said, its a great deal if you want to get levels faster, and you get some crowns thrown in for that sweet sweet flaming dog mount. But, you get a free horse that goes just as fast, so again, you don't have to spend money. \\n- you can solo. I am a solo player mostly. I am old and not good at video games, but that's ok. Its not a hard game to play, and most content is solo-able. I will eventually try to join a guild, but I am a filthy casual. dungeon finders work well and I never think I am missing something. \\n- adding that I love going from Keyboard and mouse to controller any time I want. I find myself using both depending on what I am doing and how relaxed of a play I want it to be. This game really is the Burger King of Games. Have it your way. Play whatever way you want.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"(Review After 1000 Hours):\\n\\nI'm honestly in love with this game. I've been running end game vet trials and the experience has been out of this world so far! \\n\\n(Review After 550 Hours):\\n\\nThis game is still amazing!\\n\\n(Review After 170 Hours):\\n\\nI’m going to keep this short and sweet. ESO is a huge game so not all the pros can be covered in this review but here’s my experience. Played this game back in 2014 on the Xbox and I can tell you the Dev’s have did a complete 360 on this game. \\n\\n \\n\\nPROS: \\n\\nFirst let me start off this review by saying this eso has one of the best mmo community's out there. Players are very friendly and quick to help you out when you talk in zone chat. I’ve played a lot of mmos and none of them come close to eso’s community.  \\n\\nEso has good graphics for a game that came out in 2014 & the gameplay is spot on. \\n\\nIf your worried about jumping in this game and your worried about being stuck in the beginner zones no worries. In eso zones aren't level locked, because of this the monsters will always scale to your level so your free to explore the open world! \\n\\nOther than some annoying bugs, this is the only mmo I've played that didn’t have anything game breaking that turned me off. Coming from BDO that means a lot! \\n\\nEndless amount of content including, quests, dungeons, pvp, trails, exploration, and etc. \\n\\n \\n\\nCONS: \\n\\nDungeons can be very broken or buggy. Often, I find myself glitched in a rock or some sort of post since a boss threw me like a rag doll. I have experienced a Dungeon boss so glitched he didn’t spawn and we had to redo the whole Dungeon.  \\n\\nQuest can sometimes glitch, sometimes the person you turn in a quest to is ether not there or you can't interact with them. This has only happened to me twice though. \\n\\nPvp can be so buggy at times its unplayable. This problem happens sometimes where you're in pvp then you get hit with a 1 second loading screen. 1 second isn't along time of course but in pvp you character will stop moving for a split second and then you get wrecked by other players. When this happens, your best option is to not play pvp for a while because the loading screen is persistent. \\n\\n \\n\\nMy thoughts on the crown store aka the micro transaction store: \\n\\n \\n\\nNow I understand mmos have to make money since there always adding content and working on the game as a whole. Employees need to get paid and profit needs to be made! I have no problem with the in-game store and it's not pay to win. Mostly everything is cosmetic and you can buy some digital houses from there but you can also get houses with in game gold, it's just a grind. Another great thing is if you don’t have money for things in the crown store you can always buy it off a player with in-game gold. One thing I will say, they do make the crown store tempting but it’s a business at the end of the day. \\n\\n \\n\\nHope you enjoyed the review; I don’t usually review games but I had to for this gem. <3\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The Elder Scrolls Online isn\\'t your typical Elder Scrolls game, if you\\'re coming into this expecting another Skyrim then you\\'re coming into this for the wrong reason. This game isn\\'t a Single Player RPG, but it\\'s not Quite an MMO either. Zenimax Online Studios and Bethesda have created a game that\\'s it\\'s own. This game\\'s combined the much loved Bethesda RPG Formula and your standard MMO to create a hybid that accomplishes what it\\'s set out to do.\\n\\nThe Elder Scrolls Online or \"ESO\" takes place all over Tamriel, the large continant that the entire Elder Scrolls Series takes place. ESO will take you places in Tamriel that you\\'ve always wanted to go, including revisiting places you\\'ve already been. For the Morrowind fans you can revist your harsh ashlands, and for the Oblivion fans Cyrodill is yours to explore (granted you can survive the bloody PVP battles.) If you\\'ve just played Skyrim that\\'s fine too, parts of Skyrim are explorable, this includes major holds Riften and Windhelm. \\n\\nDispite being set two eras before Skyrim our races are still here. However they all stand divided into three factions. Depending on your choice of Faction differant races will be playable and by extension entirely differant parts of the world. For the fans of the world of The Elder Scrolls this game allows you to see it all, you can visit the Orcish tribes in Highrock, the magical island of Auridon, dry deserts by the border of Elsweyr, and so many more environments. For those who love the story and lore of the Series this game has HEAPS. Based before the rise of Tiber Septim there is so much story for you! Each Alliance has it\\'s own seperate stories and questlines each one adding to the series lore. Dispite some claims, yes this game is Canon and it does make sense (trust me). \\n\\nThere\\'s so much to say about this game! I haven\\'t talked about the amazing PVP and PVE, the abilties! Or even the fantastic DLCs that are done perfectly! Zenimax Online Studios has had this game developing alongside Skyrim back pre-2011, and so much love has been put into this game, and it just get\\'s better and better every update. This immersive game has a great story, with every NPC in the game voice acted too! The world design is breathtaking and the amount of fun you can have is multiplied when playing with friends. That doesn\\'t mean you can\\'t play solo though, as this game understands that solo players are prominant especially in a series like this. A variety of Solo dungeons and a main story that\\'s almost entirely Single Player exist too! ESO knows just what to do to help you have a fun and immersive experience that\\'s got so much nostalia without alienating new fans.\\n\\nBethesda better have their Soul Gems because if you come into ESO with an open mind you\\'ll be pleasently surprised. This game is fun from the start and gets better and better as you level up. I recommend this game 100%',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Elder Scrolls Online is the best MMO I've ever played, and I've tried many.\\n\\n[b]First impression[/b]\\nI bought this the day it came out but was unimpressed. It didn't feel like an Elder Scrolls game at all. You were confined to certain areas by your level, the delves (like dungeons you can walk into) felt empty, the quests consisted of gathering some things and delivering them, rinse and repeat. Even the cool things like burning a pirate ship were only teleporting to the ship and pressing a button. The sequences that were supposed to be tremendously large battles or cataclysmic events also had about two npcs pop up and run away in fear, as if that was supposed to sell it. It didn't. I refunded the game.\\n\\n[b]Second try[/b]\\nSeveral months later I got the game again, and oh boy, was it different. You could now travel anywhere you wanted, do anything you wanted at any time, nothing was holding you back. The storytelling vastly improved. The new quests are about telling a story, and it was tremendously fun. I didn't stay for very long after this just because I was completely overwhelmed by the game, and felt that it needed much more time than I could give it to really fully experience it. Some things like the crafting research, upgrading your mount and more look like they're incredibly time consuming, even if they're done passively. It would take months to do it all.\\n\\n[b]Third try[/b]\\nI headed into the game again. This time, I decided to just have fun with it. I sat on a horse and went on a journey across the realms of Tamriel. I went from Davon's Watch to Rivenspire on horseback, enjoying the sights, and then took a ship to Abah's Landing and the Alik'r Desert. It was the most wonderful experience I've had in MMOs while exploring the vast world. Every location is visually different, but they all also feel lived in. The detail is absolutely incredible. From Morrowind to Summerset, you'll be absolutely amazed by the open world. Third time was the charm as I've reached maximum level on my first character.\\n\\n[b]The combat[/b]\\nGoing beyond traditional MMO conventions, ESO has incredibly engaging combat. Dodging, blocking and interrupting are all very important. PvP feels very competitive and PvE isn't just pressing buttons in a sequence while standing in place.\\n\\n[b]Personal touch[/b]\\nUnlike other MMOs in which there is a clear distinction between the classes in terms of what they can do, this game allows for customization the like of which I've never seen in the genre. You can take any class you want and make it do whatever you want. Furthermore, although races give you certain bonuses, you can make any class combined with any race and make it work. A lot of people focus on watching guide videos when making their characters but I would suggest you not to do that.\\n\\nThis might sound odd, but there's actually no need to follow anyone's advice. It's good to know what's out there but you can make any build work for you. That's an important thing to remember. You don't need to pick Khajit + Nightblade + Stamina + Werewolf to be a good damage dealer, and that's what's so good about this game. It allows for absolute freedom of choice. You can make a build someone else would scoff at but still be very effective with it because you made it to fit your own play style. You can use any combination of weapons, abilities, and ability rotations and not have to worry about what the meta is. Trust me, I just finished the most difficult dungeon in the game with a build that would make some youtubers lose their minds, and I had a lot of fun doing it my own way.\\n\\nThe things that matter the most in determining how good you are at what you do is your understanding of the game. That means that if you know the patterns of the bosses, how to deal with mobs, pvp tactics for Battlegrounds and Cyrodiil, you're going to be good. There is another decisive factor: your gear. Imagine your gear in ESO as if you were building a character in a MOBA. As you would expect, there are three types of gear: light, medium and heavy, and each gives a different amount of armor and raw stats; however, in ESO, gear has abilities that can vastly change the way you play depending on what you choose to equip.\\n\\nCrafting will allow you to get some great starting gear but the best things are gained by gameplay, so if you don't want to level your crafting, that's up to you. The game certainly doesn't force you into it. You have the option to buy anything you need in guild stores with gold, and attain the best gear through gameplay. This game is actually not pay to win, unlike many other MMO games, in the sense that you can get the best statistics in the game exclusively by playing, and the store offers a ton of cosmetic options athat won't let someone else outperform you on the field. You can even get certain items like experience boosts and crates by logging in every day and when leveling up for free.\\n\\nFurthermore, you can choose to make costumes for your characters, meaning you don't rely on using specific cosmetics, but can get any combination of any item you have unlocked in the outfit station, and all for a gold price without paying anything. The only thing that's locked is the ability to color your armor and weapons, which you can unlock with an ESO+ subscription.\\n\\nThat subscription is one of the best I've seen in any game. It gives you access to all of the expansions ESO has to offer excluding the newest one. That's a huge amount of content in addition to the things you get outright, like currency and experience boosts.\\n\\nA lot of people come into this game expecting it to be like any other MMO, and those people don't get the game, in my opinion. There are certain prejudices you expect with MMOs. For example, everyone thinks that picking the damage dealing class is somehow dirty, and that it's the easiest role to fill. This is not the case in ESO. Because of the way the combat works, a lot of the time you'll see that playing the damage dealer may in fact be the hardest thing you could choose to do. Many bosses and pvp tactics can instantly kill you, and they most certainly will if you don't expect and counter that. Some bosses actually really punish you for not being a tank or having lots of shields and healing abilities.\\n\\nI'm stating this because a lot of people come in thinking that picking the damage dealer is the easy choice, but they will be disappointed if they pick that role for that reason. Certainly, put on paper, it sounds as if the healer and tank have the most responsibility, whereas dealing damage is just coming with them for the ride. In real situations, in dungeons pve and in battlegrounds pvp, being the damage dealer means being the most careful out of the whole group because everyone can and will be trying to damage you.\\n\\nIf you do pick a damage dealer, you need to be aware that you will be at the mercy of every gameplay mechanic in the game. You will wait for long times to queue for dungeons. Certain bosses have lightning-fast abilities that are either very difficult to foresee and dodge or don't even show you any warning before damaging you, which is completely fine if you have 40,000 health as a tank, or use damage reduction abilities and shields as a healer. You will be targeted first in PvP as a damage dealer. The Imperial City will even go further than that and punish you for not having the extra health and damage shields by taking your rewards from you, while tanks and healers survive.\\n\\nAll three roles require a lot of skill to master, and you should pick whatever best suits your playstyle, without regard to typical MMO prejudice regarding roles and classes. Anyone can do anything, and everyone can only reach top level play with great skill.\\n\\nIt's a really fun game.\\n\\nPlay it, enjoy it, ignore the haters.\\n\\n[i]P.S.\\nAvoid the main quest line (Coldharbour) as it might quite literally make you fall asleep out of boredom with its fetch this, fetch that, travel back & forth nonsense[/i]\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Ultimately, I recommend Elder Scrolls Online(ESO) due to its overwhelming amount of fun content, especially if you\\'re mostly interested in PvE. If you\\'re a \"completionist\" type of player then playing a bit of PVP with your PVE is still pretty great. If you\\'re predominately a PVP player then my recommendation quickly turns into a toss up.\\n\\nAll of the NPCs are animated w voiced dialogue and there are many well-written quests/stories, some are even heart-touching. When you\\'re bored with quests, there are dozens of other neat elements of this game where you can spend your time. You could buy and decorate a house or you could creatively use those furnishings by building a house directly out of them. Crafting has been designed in a way that it is not only a useful but lucrative feature at every point of the game. Essentially, ESO is a successful MMO that has built so much content into the platform over the years that it is easy to feel overwhelmed with deciding what you want to do next.\\n\\nIf you are only interested in PvP, a recommendation becomes more challenging. The best part of PVP is that sets, skills, and attributes are fluid enough that there is a lot of freedom in making builds. The fundamental elements and additional mechanics offer you a great diversity of combinations to play around with and make your own. I\\'ve had a lot of fun in Cyrodiil where the alliance vs alliance vs alliance pvp occurs.\\n\\n...That said, ESO has consistently had terrible server-side performance during prime time and I assure you it is more than frustrating. Not only does this affect your enjoyment when your skill or potion [i]doesn\\'t actually go off, probably causing calamity,[/i] but this also occurs [i]for everyone else[/i]... so you get to deal with frustrated people in general, too! The broken functionality surrounding server capacity is so consistent that it has become a mechanic that people not only try to utilize... some [i]try to cause failure state to occur so that they can utilize it[/i].\\n\\nTo me, ESO feels like an \"asset\" that had a 5-year lifespan assigned to it by management and despite it\\'s successful player population surge during 2020 they\\'ve stuck to that plan. I feel this way because ZOS\\'s servers performed pretty well when PVP events were going on because ZOS set up more shards and servers. Without an event going on, it felt like servers were being taken offline in an effort to save on costs. I\\'d be shocked if the subject of server investment was ever publicly discussed by ZOS because the solutions they have offered/implemented were a severe compromise that have crippled some playstyles of the game. Group sizes were halved and you can no longer heal people outside your group. Even the randomness of probability-based effects(6% chance to cause x) were removed from every set in the game, with the intention to remove random-number-generator calculation costs(!!!). I mean... I salute their ingenuity but despite the changes, server performance remains bad enough to quit over. \\n\\nSome players are hoping that Microsoft\\'s acquisition of ZOS will result in proper hosting such as a switch of platform... well, it\\'s just as possible that the current strategy remains unchanged and this asset will continue to be neglected. It\\'s also possible that cutting the server bills happened because lower costs makes you look like a juicier acquisition target? Yeah, at this point I\\'m just making educated guesses. If you\\'re reading this, though... can you find someone to turn the servers back on? \\n\\nThen add to all of this that the scoring rules for the Cyrodiil campaign make success meaningless. Its meant to reward more money to people playing on a less-populated faction, which is good, however ESO [i]also overcompensates[/i] the worst performing alliance with a huge score bonus. In a 1v1v1 month-long campaign this changes every social dynamic for the worse since it means that 1st place only needs to wreck their biggest rival... and so the weakest team often slides easily into 2nd place because [i]they literally didn\\'t log in so they received a 2x score bonus[/i]. The difference of rewards for 1st/2nd/3rd place aren\\'t meaningful but these irrational rules for a competitive mode makes it all so... pointless.\\n\\nThe fact that nearly everyone in Cyrodiil is frustrated by the terrible performance causes general toxicity. Since there isn\\'t any tangible reason for winning the campaign(or fighting against mechanics for 2nd place), your \"allies\" in Cyrodiil are often the most toxic people in the game and they will relish the opportunity to take a scroll or hammer you conquered and run it straight into the enemy, giving it back to them.\\n\\nSo clearly, unfortunately, recommending my favorite part of this game isn\\'t possible. You can have tons of fun with PvP but you need patience or friends to suffer through it with. \\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve said enough on the game but with an MMO it\\'s important to also review the community.\\n\\nZOS managed a good community. There are many guilds filled with people trying to make the best out of the game, making schedules for their preferred content. You can use the guild finder to easily filter guilds based on content. And you can join/trial as many as you need, as long as you need up to 5 ;). There are community-written mods which we all rely on to make this an enjoyable game. The people who play ESO are usually really cool but we\\'re also dealing with a game lore with race wars so obviously it\\'s good you can report/block conventional trolls and racists.\\n\\nHowever the toxic elements of the community really stick out because you can\\'t help when a glass cannon queues into your group as a fake tank(well, you can try to kick them but you\\'re still left waiting for a tank.) You can\\'t help it when someone charges through the entire dungeon in front of you, dragging all the mobs with them and skipping all the content. You can\\'t do anything when your friend spent 15 minutes setting an ambush so they could steal an enemy hammer and massacre them... just so someone on your alliance could [i]watch you like a hawk in order to grab the hammer when it eventually drops, so they can deliberately run it into a lava pit[/i]. You can\\'t do anything if you attempt to buy crowns with gold and they defraud you(technically ZOS will repay you ONE TIME if you get scammed this way, their stated position is \\'buyer beware\\')... never mind that this is a scam caused by ZOS\\'s determination to never add crown trading to the trade window. These failings really stick out like a sore thumb.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Still wondering if you should try out ESO? Well it\\'s a bit tough to sum-up but here goes:\\n\\nCOOL\\n+ The world is friggin\\' BEAUTIFUL and the locations are diverse. Can seem a bit small, but it\\'s a fantastic experience to just explore Tamriel (and beyond) in HD glory with all it\\'s weird flora and fauna. Especailly the fauna, boy do I love cool creatures to fight! \\n+ Iconic music returns and the atmosphere is good overal. Exploring is encouraged.\\n+ Fully customizable outfits, armor and weapons. Rare mounts, pets and personalities.  A plethora of homes with countless furnishings. This game is a dream for people who like to be creative, I wish the main TES games had this much freedom!\\n+ Though gripes of the lore exist and it\\'s a bit watered-down, I\\'d say the \"TES Theme\" still feels intact. It doesn\\'t take itself too seriously, the tone fits an MMO well. It\\'s not like the main series, but ESO does have quite a bit of heart and soul.\\n+ Social aspect is good. People in general are friendly, save for PvP-oriented folk where YMMV. Finding friends, groups, guilds and joining together in battle is all very easy to do. A level 10-player can join level 50-players and still help out. Playerbase seems to be growing again. Active online community that can help you with any questions you might have.\\n+ Aquiring loot and changing your build might be less frustrating then most MMO\\'s but I\\'m not the best judge of that. If you get an item that\\'s not exactly what you want, you can alter it\\'s traits or rarity by using in-game items, and shrines to change your build. There\\'s an active marketing community so selling unwanted gear and buying specific pieces you want is easy.\\n+ The main quest and the DLC-stories are all neat and interesting storylines. I loved Vvardenfell and Clockwork City. Most side-quests are quite shallow... though some really stand out for being unique, funny or even quite morbid.\\n+ The strange inclusion of Add-on support means you can download \"mods\" that alter things like UI, controls and can even help with things like combat and the buying, selling and organising of equipment.\\n+ It\\'s not subscription-based. Aside from crazy-long download and install times, there is no loss in trying it out.\\n\\nNOT-SO-COOL\\n- There are a lot of gripes lore-related, and this game is NOT roleplayer-friendly with the hundreds of heroes running around. Do NOT expect it to be a similar experience to the main series of games, working together is encouraged and often enforced so you can\\'t really be the lone hero you might be used to being. You CAN do it, but it\\'s rather tedious.\\n- The leveling system and other RPG-aspects leaves a lot of people in want. Either for more complex builds or simply being able to have more abilities on a bar during combat. The latter I agree with, it makes combat rather boring if you don\\'t mix things up yourself. This can be a dealbreaker since you obviously fight quite a lot in a Fantasy-RPG.\\n- This counts double for PvP. The meta still changes often because things get nerfed/buffed back and forth. I\\'d say other MMO\\'s are better at handling PvP and making combat interesting, and ESO is more suited for PvE. Cyrodiil  is alright but can get repetitive, and with 3-factions it\\'s almost always 2-on-1 fighting, making it unbalanced. Nightblades suck out the fun of PvP like most assassin builds in MMO\\'s with endless stuns and going invisible, ruining the meta.\\n- Though the music is good, like most MMO\\'s there isn\\'t enough of it so it gets repetitive. I suggest playing some of your own tunes (or TES-game playlists)  while playing.\\n- Crafter\\'s Bag is an ESO+ only feature where EVERY item that has to do with crafting will be put into this endless bag of holding. This makes inventory management super-easy but for non-ESO+ people quite a nightmare. Discouraging crafting is a bad move, and feels too tedious for new players to even begin with.\\n- Similar to before, the things you have to pay real money for (Crown Store) are often a bit questionable. 20 euro\\'s for just another outfit slot or a single mount? Ridiculous. But I\\'m sure it sells well since they haven\\'t made any signs of changing prices.\\n- For some reason the majority of of the voice acting is top-notch while others.... are really, really bad. I\\'m looking at you random Dunmer lady #5 and random Argonian man #3. \\n\\nAnd that\\'s basically it. Some gripes could be easily fixed (give non-ESO+ people a crafting bag that\\'s rather small and has to be upgraded) while other\\'s are an intrinstic part of the game (disappointing combat and lack of immersion) so it depends on how you weigh these aspects whether it\\'s worth a try or not. The game isn\\'t subscription based so couldn\\'t hurt to try it out for a while and see if it grows on you. It did for me!\\n\\nThank you for reading and if you have any questions you can always leave a comment.\\nCheers!\\n\\n[I nominated this for Steam\\'s \"BEST ENVIROMENTS\" award since there is no other game that drew me into it\\'s world as well as the latest expansions \"Summerset\" did.]',\n",

       "  'review': '  ESO is a nice game that lets you play at your own pace and luxury. \\nIt is varied enough to let you do various activities even at endgame, unlike some other MMOs.\\n  If you like the Elder Scrolls universe, or a medieval fantasy kind of world, you will enjoy ESO.\\nThere are many locations that were included in the older games like Oblivion and Morrowind even some locations that are Skyrim-like. These regions and locations are nicely detailed. The graphics are very good for an MMO. I can spend my time just riding around the different locations, taking screenshots and enjoying the scenery. The amount of detail is amazing. \\n\\n  Audio and music in the game are great, with a few soundtracks from older games that add to the nostalgia.\\nGameplay wise, it is fluid and not too complicated. There are a ton of quests to undertake. If you like to immerse yourself in the lore, then these quests are nice to do, as you get more exposed to the Elder Scrolls lore. \\n  It is mostly a pve game, but there is a region that is pvp. Faction vs faction which can be fun, as mini armies fight around the map, attack resources, castles, or defend castles in sieges. \\n\\n  It is simple yet interesting. Definitely a game I would recommend getting, especially if its on sale.',\n",

       "  'review': 'FOR NEW PLAYERS TO THE GAME: this review is for you, as it is my experience from being a completely new player with no idea what is going on.  Bullet points of review after intial intro, to keep things short and sweet for those looking to buy.\\n\\nAfter being a WoW veteran since beta and playing various other MMOs (FFXIV, SWTOR, EQ, EQ2, etc.), I wanted to test this game out after it had the initial terrible reviews and then the ravingly good reviews after the rework patches.  I also was playing a LOT of skyrim special edition and wanted to expand upon that universe.\\n\\nTHIS GAME is decent.  For a new player it is immensely confusing, the world is not very linear to begin with and I really had no idea what I was doing when I made my initial character.  The tutorial and messages for new players as they play the game are lengthy, but not much time is given to read them.  Since the world is \"do whatever you want and play\", it sucks for new people since there, of course, is a best and worst of what you can do in certain situations.\\n\\nThat being said, this game is NOT skyrim.  You can\\'t get away with wearing leather armor as a caster, as it really provides no benefit.\\n\\nBULLETS:\\n- Extremely confusing to start, as the game has SO MUCH depth\\n- Alliance doesn\\'t really matter (from what I can tell), but there are WAY more people on Aldmeri Dominion\\n- The combat system is awesome, but takes some getting used to (active combat, blocking, interrupting, etc.)\\n   ~MUCH better combat than other games where you just press the buttons to do the dmg\\n- Racial aspects DO MATTER A LOT.  It will effect your end-game if you want to be an elitist\\n- The only thing you can\\'t \"reset\" is your class, so choose wisely at the start for class-specific abilities and passives\\n- You are NOT LIMITED by your class, as weapons dictate abilities (i.e. resto staff = you can heal as any class)\\n- Addons are slightly more annoying to use and there is a specific amount of memory given to them, which is a bad thing.\\n- Crafting is rather interactive and much better than other games, however without an ESO PLUS membership it sucks.\\n- ESO PLUS membership is almost NEEDED due to the crafting bag and general access.  ALMOST\\n- CROWN STORE is NOT worth it AT ALL.  Items are WAY overpriced.  Excessively so.  Watch youtube for crown purchases\\n   ~Crown crates are random loots and can contain stupid stuff such as potions and general worthlessness\\n- FORUM accounts are SEPARATE from regular accounts, when you buy the game pay attention to an email for them\\n- Armor shown at character creation doesn\\'t matter, you can get a style motif in the game to make the other races\\' armor\\n- You have two skill bars (one being gained at level 15) so you can swap between two weapons if you want\\n- Side quests are sometimes hard to find, there are addons that can help you.\\n- There are damage meters for this game (Addons)\\n- I am still confused for a lot of the UI (isn\\'t just social, guild, inventory, character tabs - much much more).\\n- breaking items apart at crafting stations is often better than selling them, be sure to check the attributes of the item\\n\\nAll that being said, I recommend this game on the FREE-TO-PLAY version, but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you watch youtube videos for beginners BEFORE purchasing.\\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND the CROWN STORE, many things on there are already available to you and you can be literally throwing your money away.  IGNORE that entire aspect unless buying UPGRADES or DLC (like imperial race upgrade)\\nPlay around with character creation, class testing, crafting, and weapon interaction before seriously committing to anything.\\nNOTE: If you get a sub, you get 1500 crowns per month you sub.  ESO plus of 3 months can provide you with the DLC and upgrades you may want and be cheaper/more beneficial than straight purchasing crowns.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] An opinionated review, sorry, there are no sweetrolls attached! [/h1] \\n\\n[b] Q. How does this compare to other Elder Scrolls Games, Morrowind, Skyrim, Oblivion etc. [/b] \\n\\nThe answer is rather simple, you can\\'t compare it. So if you\\'re looking to buy this game to further your Elder Scroll\\'s experience. Pause for a moment. This isn\\'t Elder Scrolls, it\\'s a game made inside the Elder Scrolls universe. \\n\\n[b] Tamriel [/b] Is as beautiful as ever, nostalgia is everywhere, from the unforgettable landscape of Morrowind, to the ice cold unforgivable landscape of Skyrim. Cyrodiil however, it is where living legends roam the countryside intending on making you their prey, where castles and keeps and being assaulted by marauding adventurers. Survive if you can or conquer if you wish to be crowned the Emperor. There really is a world for you to explore and lose yourself in.\\n\\n\\n[b] Q. Gameplay [/b] \\n\\nTo put it simply, It\\'s an MMO (Massive multiplayer) meaning, you\\'ll spend most of your time in \"Third Person\", but there is the option to enter \"First Person\". Which is better?, from experience Third. There\\'s often so much going on inside a dungeon or when you\\'re delving into the madness of the world that being able to see what\\'s happening around you is the difference between life and a swift but somewhat temporary death. \\n\\nIf you\\'ve played Morrowind you\\'ll be accustomed to a very in-depth character creation, that is not quite the case in TESO (TheElderScrollsOnline). Character creation is not as in-depth, nor is it lackluster. Your weapon and armour essentially define you. Meaning the class you pick at the beginning, from which there are six are essentially the cherry on the cake. \\n\\n[b] Q. Do I need to equip my credit card! [/b] \\n\\nNot quite!. Although you\\'ll need to acquire the game to play!. Much has been said about the  \\n[b] Crown Store [/b]  The name given for the in-game market. This is a place to buy cosmetic mounts, cloths and in-game dlc!.  \\n[b] Crowns [/b] depending on your financial situation can be expensive. Most of us were not born into riches. Some of the better gear in the game is locked behind DLC. This is a fact, but, if you\\'re in the game for the long run, all is not lost!.\\nWork hard at a profession in the game, or simply burgle you way till your purse can hold no more, then sell items in a trade market or Fence ;-) ( Trade market requires you to join a guild - More details below), then when you\\'ve amassed a small fortune, you\\'ll be able to trade [b] gold coins [/b] for [b] Crowns [/b] with other players. \\n\\n[b] How trading crowns works [/b]\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to part with Gold for Crowns, then ask in Zone(General Chat) for someone who is a regular and known seller(or buyer) of crown items, trade with the trusted. They need to [b] gift [/b] the Crown items to you  then you need to [b] give [/b] them the gold, hence why trust is necessary. Hopefully one day Zenimax will implement a way to ensure that when these items are traded, it\\'s done without the worry of gifting your crowns without the gold coming your way. \\n\\nThis means, yes, you can acquire the DLC\\'s in the game without hurting your bank account. Thankfully there are fortunate people in the game who like to buy Crowns and trade them for gold.\\n\\n\\n[b] Q. Is there a universal auction house?. [/b]\\n\\nNo. You\\'ll need to join a guild, but there\\'s no need to worry. Trade guilds are, well they are trade guilds!, so if you\\'re somewhat anti-social for personal reasons please don\\'t worry yourself. Some trade guilds do offer the chance to do dungeons together or run around and politely put hideous monsters back to sleep, then run off with their loot. Guilds can have up to 500 members and you can join five guilds in total! meaning if you join five active trade guilds, you can trade with many more people, buying low, selling high. \\nOften people are so wrapped up in trading, the world of Tamriel weeps at the loss of their footsteps outside the city walls. Although some of us do not! More herbs for us to collect! \\n(Oh, if you\\'re a Morrowind baby, I\\'m sorry to tell you, you will not need an PHD in alchemy, sadly it\\'s much more simple in TESO) \\n\\n\\n[b] Subscription [/b] \\n\\nTo sub, or not to sub. hmmm, This really is a pain! I love the subscription due to the fact it helps with quality of life. I\\'ve decided to copy and paste from TESO\\'s website the details, it\\'s better you decide for yourself. Underneath I\\'m going to give some thoughts on a few of these things, to explain in a little more detail.\\n\\n [b] Non-ESO Plus™ Members [/b] Need to Purchase DLC game packs, No crafting storage bonus, No free crowns, No extra bank space, no bonus gold & XP, No bonus to crafting, No costume dyeing, Transmutation Crystals - No bonus to currency cap, No exclusive deals.\\n\\n [b] ESO Plus™ Members [/b] Full access to all DLC game packs, Unlimited storage for crafting materials, 1650 crowns per month, Double Bank space for your account, 10% increase to Gold & Experience acquisition, 10% increase to Crafting Inspiration & Trait Research rates, Double Furnishings & Collectables space in player housing, Costume Dyeing, Exclusive ability to dye costumes, Transmutation Crystals, Double currency cap for Transmutation Crystals, Exclusive access to unique Crown Store deals.\\n\\nSo, [b] bank space [/b] . Yes it\\'s lovely, with sub, you go from 100 to 200. But you can buy more space in-game with Gold, so if you\\'re not subbed, you can go from 100 to 150, you buy 10 spaces at a time - each becomes more expensive. \\n\\nIn game, there is an [b] Outfit station [/b] non-subbed can still use this! \"Outfits are completely different from Costumes. \\nYou can design your characters armour (outfit) appearance with the outfit station in any major city as well as some of the smaller towns (check your map!). At first you\\'ll only be able to make gear relevant to your species. As you make characters from other races or buy \"Motif\\'s\" from the trade guilds, you\\'ll start to flesh out your collection. It takes time!\\nAlso you can open a window called \"Collections\" - Choose appearance - Head - Hide Helmet! wuhuuu. \\nCostumes! These are items that go into your \"Collections\" - They are full outfits, head to toe. As a sub you can dye them, non-subbed, not so. Unless you get a free set of paints in game, sadly you\\'ll not be able to dye them, but most people use the outfit station as it really is super cool!. \\n\\n[h1] Closing thoughts [/h1]\\n\\nI don\\'t want to bore people, nor scare them away. I\\'ve tried to cover as much as I feel is relevant without making people feel like they\\'re reading a book. \\n\\nThis is an MMO! Yes, you\\'re going to have to work for what you get, it won\\'t chase you across Tamriel and throw itself into your backpack. All things take time, so not being subscribed just means it\\'ll take longer.\\n\\nI\\'ve had issues with the game, I\\'ve contacted Zenimax and I\\'ve been blown away with their kindness. I\\'ve read negative comments regarding their customer service, but four times I\\'ve contacted them, four times they\\'ve put my mind at ease. It\\'s hard to fault them, they\\'ve made a beautiful game and like all business\\'s they\\'re trying to make money to continue keeping the ElderScrolls alive and well. \\n\\nTo buy or not to buy.\\n\\nIt\\'s Elder Scrolls. It\\'s beautiful. It\\'s all voice dialogue, but just as many lore books to be read, there\\'s decisions to be made, caves to be delved in, pockets to be picked, guars to be admired, daedric princes to be rebuked. There\\'s hair-tingling moments when you meet certain people from certain races that you thought had long perished, there\\'s vampires and werewolves, battlegrounds for the brave. It\\'s Elder Scrolls. \\n\\nYou decide. Till then, thank you Zenimax for making over 1000 hours of my life very enjoyable. \\n\\nThank you for putting a certain boat, on a certain river, with a certain Census and Excise Office, in a place I\\'ll always think of as home. <3 Morrowind.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]An Excellent RPG Experience Disguised As An MMO[/h1]\\n\\n[b][u]THE MOST CASUAL AND SOLO FRIENDLY MMO OUT THERE[/u][/b]\\n\\nIs this Pay To Win? [b]No[/b]\\nIs this Pay To Enjoy? [b]No[/b]\\nIs this a Boring Grindfest? [b]No[/b]\\n\\n[b]What is this game?[/b]\\nThis game is the most extensive single player Elder Scrolls RPG experience across the whole of Tamriel, [i]that you can also play with friends,[/i] but without the grind and pay to win elements of the usual MMOs.\\n\\n[b]Are you penalized for not subscribing?[/b]\\nNo, not exactly. Everyone is on par performance wise, you don't lose out in skills or gear, neither does a subber's mount move faster than yours. What's notable in the subscription is access to all available DLCs (excluding Summerset), and the crafting bag. Crafting bag is only invaluable if you are into crafting for storing materials which otherwise take up your inventory, and all DLCs can be individually bought outside of a subscription. \\n\\n[h1]On with the Review[/h1]\\n[b]What do you get for the entry price?[/b] [i](It's very often on sale for USD$10)[/i]\\nESO is a game that sets heavy emphasis on freedom of play as an RPG and sets as little limit on exploration and questing as possible. \\n\\nPlayers pick one of 3 alliances but are free to explore any parts of a zone since enemies are scaled or explore any alliance freely to pick up quests, not necessarily in any order though each zone will have a particular story quest line unfolding and 5 zones make up an alliance's story quest line. This is aside from your character's main story quest line which eventually unlocks another zone. Everything adds up to a massive amount of content for RPG players to enjoy, and that is just the base game. Like any good RPG, this game has a wide array of skill lines to progress, weapons, armor, class, race, guild and world skills. The freedom to learn abilities and passives across multiple skill lines in each of those categories allows players a lot of freedom in how to play their characters. Like previous Elder Scrolls games, you can even become a werewolf or vampire.\\n\\n[b]Cut the Crap, I mean Grind[/b]\\nCharacter progression goes hand in hand with the amount of content so you are constantly progressing as you play and don't have to actively grind. Reaching level cap of 50 unlocks a Champion's point leveling system. This system is account wide, so every character that hits 50 can access your Champion points without needing to grind all over again. This system even has a boosted experience gain daily which can accumulate for 14 days to assist progression for casual players. Unless you are the type who prefers to power level and repetitively grind dungeons to max out your character, my advice is to just do content. The character progression and content is so extensive that all you need is to play and you will eventually get there as you play through the game. \\n\\n[b]Man Hours?[/b]\\nYou are looking at hundreds of hours just to complete everything in the base game, over 1000 hours if you play more than one character and intend to max out your champion points.\\n\\n[b]What if I only pay for the Standard Edition?[/b]\\nUndoubtedbly, there's the understanding of paid content expansion aside from the base game (standard edition already comes with the Morrowind expansion), and there are perks tied to a couple of these expansions in terms of crafting, but note that the game is designed that none of those are essential to playing and completing any content at all. Players can but need not be involved with trading or crafting to play the game.\\n\\nGear wise, each zone offers 3 gear sets plus 3 more from each zone's dungeon and a couple of craftable sets, so options are plentiful. The advantages of better performing sets (some exclusively in DLCs) in the hands of a min-maxer can be significant, but really anything goes. Never in my 700hrs of play did I feel handicapped for having random gear and not BIS sets.\\n\\nAside from content expansions, the other store items are purely services and cosmetics, costumes, mounts, player housing and consumable boosts. No pay to win items. Now some of these items are seasonal and comes in the form of loot crates. I have to mention the developers are big on rewarding players with some of these for free, through non-grindy events designed to be hard to not win them, or through the daily log-in bonus. I have not paid for anything other then zone content DLCs but have gotten plenty of cosmetics for free through questing, daily rewards and free loot crates.\\n\\n[b]Bravo Maestro![/b]\\nMMOs often get away with mediocrity in the sound department and no voiced dialogues outside of cutscenes. The beautifully orchestrated signature musical scores of The Elder Scrolls series is subtly ever present in the background along with epic battle music and fully voiced dialogues for every NPC giving the game an immersion befitting of an Elder Scrolls game.\\n\\n[b]Which edition should I buy?[/b]\\nTESO Standard Edition - includes base game and Morrowind Chapter (Morrowind DLC + Warden Upgrade)\\nTESO Summerset - includes base game and Summerset Chapter (without Morrowind DLC + Warden Upgrade)\\nTESO Collection - includes the above as well as Thieve's Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Orsinium and Imperial City DLCs\\nTESO Elsweyr - has multiple editions, one of which includes base game, Morrowind, Summerset and Elsweyr chapters.\\n\\nTESO Standard Edition has massive value when on sale for $10 considering the hundreds of hours of content, the reason also being there's no separate Morrowind upgrade on STEAM, and buying Morrowind + Warden separately on the Crown store costs 5000 crowns or $50.\\n\\nNever buy TESO Summerset, you don't get Morrowind + Warden class and it only costs a few dollars more for the TESO Collection during a sale. \\n\\nTESO Collection is currently the best value in early 2019 after getting a 30% permanent price reduction and when on sale for additional 40% off is ridiculously cheap at $29.99 and gives you the DLCs upfront permanently.\\n\\nTESO Elsweyr is the latest chapter and commands a high price, not recommended to buy it for the base game and Morrowind + Summerset to get started in TESO as the TESO Collection has more content and value when on sale.\\n\\n[b]Final Words[/b]\\nESO has been reworked and feels like a whole different game since it's release, in a good way for players. This game combines the feel of an MMO such as 4 men dungeons, 12 men trials (raids) and taking on open world bosses with a grand scale RPG that can be played completely solo or with friends.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It is very simple if you like The Elder Scrolls games and lore you will also like this game, it is extremely rich in story and lore about the whole TES universe. This game is not hard and it is more focused on PVE side which make it enjoyable to play and no rush. You will experience the whole Tamriel and each country and race. Quests are very story rich and you can spend months to follow each main and side quests. However newer expansions are very poorly written and you can see that they just rushed to release it to take the money, i do not recommend them. Even if this game is mmo, most content you will experience is singleplayer which is okay for story because you need focus to follow everything and relax same like you are reading the book. Skills and combat are okay, not to hard, not to easy which make not to lose to much time in combat and not to speedrun to much. For someone like me that likes to take screenshoots and enjoy in cosmetics this game is also good at it. There is a lot of good places to enjoy the view and a lot of cosmetic items to unlock.',\n",

       "  'review': \"One of the better MMO's on the market right now. I will keep this simple, I won't waste your time as everyone has different tastes with MMO's and there is alot of debate on whether ESO is a good game or not within the MMO community. I will simply go over pro's/con's.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n- HUGE open-world to explore and lots of open-world content such as quests, delves (mini-dungeons), public dungeons, bosses, treasure chests, materials to farm, etc. \\n\\n-No Pay2win\\n\\n- Alot of customization, but I will explain this further, later in the review.\\n\\n- The combat is a bit mixed. Some classes/weapons are more fun and versatile than others, but this is entirely dependent on the player's preference. The only true problem with combat is the absolute necessity to weave your light-attacks in-between your skills. Alot of players don't like the idea of animation canceling being required for good damage in end-game content. With this in mind however, I find the combat fun regardless.\\n\\n- Making big money/gold isn't hard, it's just time consuming when you're a newbie. Don't worry about this too much until you're max level.\\n\\n- Leveling is fairly easy, if you're into that.\\n\\n- This game has enough lore to fill up 60,000 books worth.\\n\\nThe Meh:\\n\\n- There is a lot of DLC. This game has been out for a long while, and the dev's monetize this game via DLC. The base game is big, but the collection of DLC's are bigger. More fun content is nice, but it can be expensive if you want all of it. Optionally you can buy a subscription for ESO+ which gives you access to ALL DLC in the game except the newest expansion at that current time.\\n\\nThe Bad: \\n\\n-A lot of the customization is locked behind a paywall that is the Crown Store, and a lot of the motif (armor/weapon style) pages are locked behind RNG and/or pricey purchases with in-game gold. This becomes a lot easier to handle as you play longer.\\n\\n- The community is very helpful most times, but you're going to get some assholes who can ruin an experience such as trial (raid) leaders who disband a party of players because they are salty over something, thus wasting everyone's time. Zone chat can be silly-fun but again there is some weirdo's who can be off-putting. There is also PvP players and PvE try-hard's who can be nasty as well. This is just gaming community in general though. \\n\\n- The lack of tutorials are off-putting. Expect to have a lot of questions as you play.\\n\\n- You WILL need guide's to understand end-game content (veteran trials/dungeons). You can try to wing it, but expect a lot of failure unless you get carried by your party-members. \\n\\n- Half of your performance as a player will depend on your build, meaning your armor/weapon set and your class skills. If you just slap on anything you feel like and then attempt harder content, chances are you will fail. There must be some sort of value in what you build. \\n\\nOverall, I love this MMO despite it's flaws, I give it a solid 8/10 at the moment.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've played this game for over 2 years, closing in on 3 years in December. I've played WoW for 14+ years. I'm not new to MMOs. I can tell you, without a shadow of a doubt, that the developer of ESO, Zenimax, is putting this game on maintenance mode. If you want to play this game, just know that it is not as good as it used to be, because they have shifted a lot of their dev team off this game.\\n\\nThey are currently working on another MMO and ESO has been put onto a minimum effort content cycle of wringing money from people's wallets whilst they go full steam ahead on another game. New content is half-assed and designed to get you to spend money for minimal effort. Not only that, but they've started putting very overpowered gear into each new expansion/DLC to get people to purchase them, and then they nerf those items within a few months. It is downright scummy.\\n\\nThe game itself is fun and the base content is plentiful, but if you want to do more than casual leveling you have to pay for a subscription as it functions as a solution to every problem that is introduced if you want to do more than questing. Professions? Get a sub. Endgame? Get a sub. Participate in auctions and trading? Get a sub. Housing? Get a sub. Make your character(s) look cool? Get a sub.\\n\\nShould mention how bad their forum is as well. They have a salaried group of people whose sole job is to police their forum hardcore. You cannot post anything negative about the game there. Ever. You will get your posts removed/edited by their mod police, if not get outright banned. I wish I was joking. Just browse through it and look at how many posts get edited by ZOS mods lol.\\n\\nAnd if you want to know how Zenimax treats their playerbase, let's look at something that happened last year in 2021: https://old.reddit.com/r/elderscrollsonline/comments/pfgvvn/entire_raid_group_banned_for_reporting_a_bug/\\nThey will outright ban people for reporting bugs. This is not the first time, nor the last time, that Zenimax has banned people for bug reporting. REPORTING. Not even taking advantage of a bug, but just experiencing it and then reporting it, like they are told to do. And bugs in this game are so frequent that you have to tiptoe over eggshells lest you might get banned. Currently, there is a re-occurring bug with daily login rewards that can give the reward multiple times. People have accidentally gotten multiple rewards because they don't even know it's a bug. Many of those people ARE GETTING RETROACTIVELY BANNED. For something that this inexperienced dev team can't properly fix. Talk about sad.\\n\\nI've made a lot of friends in this game and had a ton of fun, but it is absolutely not a game worth investing in anymore. Just find something else.\\n\\nAlso, that 21 million players thing is a load of shit. Their highest player peak was under 50k and the daily peak is like 20k and declining. And looking through the recent reviews on here, it looks like ZOS may be buying positive reviews. Accounts that have not even setup profiles, but go out of their way to review a single game? Yeah that's not questionable at all.\\n\\nEdit 2 months later: My friend with 12000 hours was permabanned. No prior warnings, straight to permanent. He had pretty much stopped playing the game already, so kind of weird to get banned when he had not much game time. He also wrote a negative review on Steam, so it's not surprising to come to the conclusion that my friend was revenge banned by ZOS for the review. I'm probably up next for a ban.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It took me about 100 hours of playing ESO on Steam and on Stadia mobile before it \"clicked\". I kept thinking \"I wan\\'t to like this game so bad! Take me away!\"... and it didn\\'t feel like it was. My partner has over 3000+ hours sunk into ESO and I wanted to have that same connection with a game. I am a Destiny convert, and have now learned how easy it is to fall into the trap of holding a game\\'s identity up to another game out of assumption that it will give you the same reward, or lack thereof. Many attempts at a character, making it to like level 20 and then stopping, starting a new one. Never finishing a quest chapter or DLC. Then suddenly one day I realized I am 100+ hours deep in this game, and I play it at least a little bit every day. It finally hit me that I am actually playing the game exactly how it was intended to be played. MY WAY! Once I realized that I had been trying to force this game into something it\\'s not, the game world totally opened up and invited me in. To make a long story short. Free your mind before you start this, and let it take you away once you\\'re there. Let your curiosity drive your story, and this game will reward you beyond the likes of any other on the market right now. It might click for you right away, or in 100 hours like me. Just don\\'t try to seek-out the point of the game, because you kind of create the \"point\" of it. I\\'m glad I stuck with it. I think I\\'m in this for the long haul now. <3',\n",

       "  'review': 'Preface: I do not have thousands, or even hundreds, of hours in The Elder Scrolls Online. There are plenty of reviews from seasoned veterans. I wanted to write this review from the perspective of a new player, because if you\\'re reading this, that\\'s exactly what you\\'ll be. MMORPGs can be a make or break for people within the first dozen or so hours, even less sometimes. I\\'ve been playing MMORPGs since 1996; I started with The Realm, advanced to Ultima Online, and I\\'ve played World of Warcraft (WoW) for the last 11 years.\\n\\nIf we\\'re going to compare The Elder Scrolls Online to any popular MMORPG of this era, it\\'s most comparable to WoW in almost every single way. That said, it\\'s a very vanilla WoW, hearkening back to the days of old, perhaps only as advanced as The Burning Crusade was (WoW\\'s first expansion); not the new age, cookie cutter, infantile garbage it has turned into. The user interface (UI) is severely lacking, and learning even the basics of the game is incredibly daunting; I found myself struggling hard, especially with the map system, for the first few days that I played. Without add-ons, there\\'s not even a mini-map on the UI, nor is there an experience bar. Be prepared to download a lot of add-ons if you plan on playing this title.\\n\\nThe world of Tamriel itself is ridiculously massive, with tons of exploration opportunities, achievements to unlock, caves to explore, dungeons to pilfer, waypoints (fast travel) to unlock, cities to visit, and an overwhelming amount of quests to complete. Regardless of whether or not you\\'re into Elder Scrolls lore, this entire release is a prequel; so that will interest lore fanatics, and also lead in newcomers to the series. The graphics are excellent, a bit better perhaps than Final Fantasy XIV, and the entire world is beautifully detailed. If you\\'re looking for a game to get lost in with immersion, this is the one. It also helps that every single quest is voice-acted, so there\\'s a very minimal amount of reading for those that skip by reading quests if there\\'s too much text involved. \\n\\nIt should also be noted that players in this game are friendly, and are usually willing to help newcomers. Dungeon queues are exhaustingly long at times, but I found that requeueing sometimes gets an instant pop, making me wonder if the netcode or matching is bad. You can join up to 5 guilds at one time, and all of your characters will be put into each guild that you join; so you don\\'t have to go out of your way to keep getting invited when you roll alts.\\n\\nCrowns and the Crown Store are quite possibly the biggest downfall to The Elder Scrolls Online. Now, buying in-game items with real life money is a choice left up to each individual. You can buy mounts, pets, homes, furnishings, and a whole slew of other things, even items that help you level and so on. The thing is, everything is absurdly overpriced. The crown to dollar ratio is roughly 100 Crowns per dollar (at least in CAD), so let\\'s say 1,000 Crowns is $10; doesn\\'t sound like a lot at first, but consider that mounts range from 1,200 ($12) - 3,000 ($30) Crowns, and the nicer homes can go up to a whopping 13,000 Crowns ($130). Suffice it to say, unless your pockets run deep, you will need to give up the idea of attaining all in-game collectibles. Many of the Crown Store offers are also a pressured \"Limited Event\", which makes collectors succumb to non-refundable impulse buys, and none of these items can be unlocked by simply playing the game.\\n\\nThough beyond the aforestated, many of the in-game mechanics are obviously handicapped to play in favor of making you want to spend your hard earned money in the Crown Store. For instance, mount stamina/speed/capacity; you can pay in-game gold to upgrade one of these three attributes every 20 hours, which will literally take 60 days PER STAT, PER CHARACTER, or you can buy them from the Crown Store in bulks of 10. If you want an XP boost, you have to buy XP scrolls from the Crown Store. If you want your own personal merchant to call upon while out in the wild, it\\'s a whopping $50. Want to be a Werewolf or Vampire? If you can\\'t find someone to bite you, it\\'s $15. The list just goes on and on, and quite honestly it brings the entire experience down. Paying for DLC is cool, mounts yeah okay to a certain point, but when companies start purposefully handicapping in-game content to pressure players to buy upgrades with real money, that\\'s scummy.\\n\\nWhile The Elder Scrolls Online is a decently fun MMORPG, something about it lacks the addictive nature of other games of the same genre. The release is going into its second expansion, Summerset, and the level cap is still 50 (since launch), the Warden class came with Morrowind, but no new races have come about; save for the Imperial race, which has to be bought in the Crown Store for $10. That said, it\\'s also a very large game, even just the base title can keep players entertained for thousands of hours through hundreds upon hundreds of quests, dungeons, raids, and world bosses. If you want to get the best experience that you can a monthly subscription will be needed, but it\\'s not required. A monthly sub unlocks all of the DLC, rather than having to pay for it individually with Crowns, you get 1,500 Crowns per month, and a few other things including a separate, infinite resource holding bag for crafting. \\n\\nIf you can look past the greed of the Crown Store, the lack of addictive gameplay, and the extremely vanilla properties of The Elder Scrolls Online, you may just have fun. It\\'s refreshing to see an MMORPG without cookie cutter builds, and no catering to the masses to provide playability for everyone. It takes time to learn and get used to, right down to the most basic functions. More importantly, the questing is fun, and the world is massive. Prepare for a lot of clicking, though, at least until you get to a high enough level to use only your skills.\\n\\n[h1]Rating: [b]4.0/5.0[/b] - Excellent, highly worth playing.[/h1]\\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore',\n",

       "  'review': 'Cons:\\n- Differs from other TES titles in that you only occasionally change the world and NPCs rarely if ever stay dead (but there\\'s a possible lore reason for it and it\\'s an MMO so what do you do)\\n- The zones feel small compared to other TES games\\n- Unless you pay monthly for ESO plus, your inventory might feel cramped, especially just starting out before being able to afford inventory expansions\\n- I find the direct PVP to be inaccessible to new players at this point\\n- Has a \"meta\" that\\'s hard to ignore (which the developers are trying to correct)\\n- Takes up like 70 gigs of drive space (I got an external drive)\\n- Has an in-game cash shop with not-so-mircro transactions and some RNG based loot\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Excellent and aesthetically pleasing character customization (if you aren\\'t for some reason determined to make a hideous character like in Oblivion)\\n+ Classes, races, skill lines, and the freedom to distribute a limited (but still generous) amount of skill points encourages diversity between players\\n+ Being able to explore never before seen areas of Tamriel (extra con: - Only slivers of Elsweyr, insert sad cat emoji here)\\n+ Kate Beckinsale, Bill Nighy, John Cleese, other actors I don\\'t remember but there\\'s the guy who played Dumbledore (the one who\\'s still alive, Something Gambon), the one for Twilight Sparkle (if you\\'re into that, but she\\'s good however you slice it), THE THERAPIST FROM UNTIL DAWN, AND also, PRESIDENT JOHN HENRY EDEN AS MOLAG BAL WHAAAAAAT, and of course the OG Wonder Woman as Azura, as per usual\\n+ Even though the maps are small they are jam packed with quests and happenings (which might be what makes them feel small, there\\'s hardly any wasted space)\\n+ The paid cash shop content is either merely cosmetic, or is DLC that is absolutely worth the price for the extra work and polish put into it\\n+ SO. MUCH. LORE.\\n+ The PVP in Cyrodiil is pretty good if you\\'re not skirmishing, just use siege machines and run away from people\\n\\nSome notes for those curious:\\n\\nElder Scrolls Online takes place millenia before the events of TESV: Skyrim, so don\\'t expect to see any dragons (because they\\'re not back yet). Similarly, please realize that the Aldmeri Dominion alliance isn\\'t any more evil than the other alliances you can choose from. They\\'re not high elven supremacists in this game (source: Queen Ayrenn literally condemns high elven supremacy in one of her dialogues). You\\'re the prejudiced one for thinking so. :)\\n\\nExtra words from me:\\n\\nI\\'ll be honest, when ESO first came out, all it took were a few screenshots and some bad early reviews to get me to stick to the single player games. I figured it would come and go like The Matrix Online, but, like that One guy, it persisted. I probably wouldn\\'t have liked it at launch, but when it had a free weekend at the beginning of summer this year and I was burnt out from a tough semester of pretending to like ancient philosophy, I tried it out. I ended up buying Gold edition for myself and my wife (I\\'ve always been partial to the Thieves\\' Guild and Dark Brotherhood), and we played it together (which I highly recommend, playing a TES game with a friend is amazing). I\\'m not sure how many things they\\'ve changed since launch, but it\\'s caught me.\\nThis game\\'s got quests and sidequests with engrossing stories and memorable characters, beautiful landscapes and cities with music to match, and not everything looks the freaking same like in Skyrim. You can fight bears, run dungeons, drink mead with the Nords; not once will you ever be bored. There\\'s crafting, cooking, enchanting, alchemy, stealing, killing, adventures, achievements, everything.\\nAnd listen, because I know some people care about this, the game doesn\\'t try to tell you anything about your character except that Mannimarco killed you and trapped your soul in Coldharbour. People consider that an Elder Scrolls staple, and it\\'s in this game, so you\\'re welcome. There are even user-created add-ons to enhance the experience, though they aren\\'t quite as wild as the mods for the single player games can get (as far as I know, I haven\\'t gone down that rabbit hole and don\\'t care to because ignorance is bliss).\\n\\nSo, especially if you like the Elder Scrolls games, I highly recommend ignoring all the sorely uninformed negative reviews and buying this game. If you have always wanted to explore Tamriel, not just confined to Skyrim, or Vvardenfell, or Cyrodiil, you should absolutely get this game. If you need that sweet succulent lore, you need this game. If you have friends that also like Elder Scrolls and you wish you could play together, you should all get this game.\\n\\nWhatever your choice, I wish upon you Bright Moons, walker!',\n",

       "  'review': 'This review is strictly from 6.1.4. It\\'s when I put up my armour and moved on from the masterpiece that the game is. The game may have changed - for the better likely.\\n\\nI must recommend this game. It\\'s just too damn good. I spent most of the lockdown grinding it. Now, before you turn around and say, \"I\\'ve tried it before, the combat/game-play doesn\\'t feel as fun. Well, there\\'s a simple solution to that. Invest some money in the game, purchase the necromancer class, play them as a ranged Magicka class and enjoy every minute of every hour whilst playing the game.\\n\\nThe game is as cool as it sounded; you can level any route (obviously, some are better than others). Becoming a vampire or a werewolf is quite simple, so if that\\'s your thing, ask in a guild or a town, and people will do it for free. You get so many skill points at this point that you shouldn\\'t worry about not having enough. You will because with every area come to these things called sky-shards, 3 of these, reward you one skill point and within the whole game I think a total is close to around 300 sky-shards. Meaning 100 bonus on top of what you get from quest-lines/story-lines. There will be a point where you just get bored and spend them on useless crap.\\n\\nStories in this game are fantastic; they are in an Elders Scrolls-y fashion for sure. Many mythological characters we only hear in the main 5 games are actual talkable characters in this. There are your side quest-lines, dark brotherhood, or thieves guild or whatnot are all full of fun and lore. Some require doing stupid side quests to level your standing/level with the specific guild, but all of the quests flesh out to add to your surroundings and feeling of this natural world.\\n\\nGuilds in the game are what guilds should be in all games. Non-commit. Obviously, if you\\'re in a raiding guild, you\\'ll be expected to show for events, or a trading guild will require a min selling amount every week. To explain it better, you have the availability to join multiple guilds. I used to stick to a casual guild that ran gear runs (some key sets drop in raid level dungeons and people are usually ass at their role and need these runs to get a better feel for the class). These casual guilds are more than often very lovely and very easy going; I haven\\'t had a lousy guild experience, well, maybe that one odd person, but they get usually kicked out quick. The other side of the game is trading. For trading, each town/settlement has 1-7 traders. These are all owned by a guild. Guild leaders can bid for a trader based on how much income they get from taxing players for using their traders. You can only sell at your guild\\'s trader.\\nObviously, due to this, there is a finite amount of traders, so underdeveloped guilds might have a trader once a month in a random spot that\\'s not very populated. But giant top-level trading/raiding guilds will have constant traders in capitals and bustling areas. So obviously, you won\\'t make the amount you need to cover your trading tax and can then put in a fee to the guild that covers you for that week, usually ranging from 10k-500k, depending on the traders\\' location. To bridge the gap of some traders having better spots than others, a MAJESTIC tool called Tamriel Trade Centre was birthed. Now, it\\'s a simple tool you download, install, and whenever you launch the game, it syncs the prices of how much everything in the world is currently worth, so a potion might one day be worth 50 gold per bottle but go up in price if its new or not many people are crafting it making it surge to 100 gold per bottle allowing you to know what the general selling amount it should go for. TTC also enables you to search for particular crafted/farmed gear. If you need something asap and for cheap, head to the site, select your platform/region and look up the gear or mats, and you\\'ll be able to find the items you need. Make sure you launch the app every time you run ESO, though otherwise, the tool will give you out of date prices, nor will it update the website with the items you have listed.\\n\\nPvP in the game is something different. It reminds me of GW2, where you have a large war campaign and need to capture elder scrolls/keeps/outposts to gain area. It\\'s a way that you can level from scratch, so if PvE is not for you, go to the campaign map once you hit 10 (or maybe it was 15) and level that way. When I was leaving, they were introducing global cool-downs to AOE effects as the servers would be under heavy load and cause substantial lag issues. But I cannot recommend the fun you have with PvP (I\\'m not personally generally into PvP in MMO\\'s); it\\'s on another level. I remember playing as a healer, meeting some of the top players in our Alliance and becoming one of the \"casuals\". Just remember to ask to join a party; if someone is advertising the guild like a b****, leave and try with someone else. I met a lot of great friends through PvP. Alternatively, I recommend just doing some of the campaign quests that are in surrounding villages. They are fun but not as fun as the outside-campaign quests.\\n\\nRight, mounts in the game are a bit weird... because, in a way, you could say they are the one P2W mechanic, not really a P2W, just a pain to level. Every mount is split into 3 parts stamina/speed/carrying capacity. They are pretty self-explanatory; you spend 250 gold every 20 hours to level one of the 3 skills by 1 point. Each tree has 60 points available per tree. So, even if you were to do it perfectly, it will take you about 150 days to get a fully levelled mount. It is HIGHLY recommended to fill out your char slots and just log on on each character to level the mount on each one. The way I did it was focus on Speed>Stamina>Carrying capacity. The P2W issue comes in that you can buy an item that levels one of these mount skills by one, and you can just stock up on them if you have the money.\\n\\nThat being said, you will receive items daily as part of the rewards calendar; you miss a day, it just means that your calendar decreases by a day. So you might not get the last few items. Hence it\\'s recommended to log onto a character once a day, even if it is just for the reward. The shop is full of cosmetics, and that\\'s what its good for, because sooner or later, either you\\'ll save up millions for someone to gift you a pack (unless you\\'re from Germany where packs are banned, so you have to ask someone outside the country for it) or you\\'ll end up buying crowns (premium currency) and wasting it to get that awesome pink wolf mount.\\n\\nThe subscription in the game isn\\'t a must-have; I know a lot of people that played without it and didn\\'t suffer. But once you sub, you won\\'t be able to go back. Not having to worry about running to your bank is an exceptional experience. The crafting bag just makes life so so so much better. You get the 10% boost to XP, too, as well as access to all current DLC/Expansions apart from the most recent one. Which is just a no-brainer. Also, you get a nice chunk of crowns every month.\\n\\nThe DLC/Expansions release on the game works as such. First, they release an expansion sized update to the game (usually £30 on release but can get it on cdkeys for half price usually); they then follow it up with 2 DLC sized stuff, usually much smaller but still incredibly noticeable and relevant. It\\'s a great model; it adds new gathering/crafting skills and really creates a constant fresh feeling to the game with new sets/new recipes/new activities.\\n\\nDailies/Weeklies are fun, unlike WoW, where you want to shoot off your leg doing them. These will take an hour max. You get your usual do a dungeon for a boost of XP. Your crafting is based on your proficiency at a crafting tree; how many points you invested will change the materials you craft with; these quests give you great rewards. \\n\\nI would go on, but I\\'ve reached the word limit for a review.\\n\\nTo finish off, as someone else said in the review: this game ruined my life. Had fun tho 👍🏿',\n",

       "  'review': \"TLDR - Good Game Solo or With Friends Only need to spend the first $20 everything can be attained. Not grindy and LOTS to do. \\n\\n\\nPros\\n----------------------\\n-Grind and Ease of play\\nYou can play as casual or intense? as you want. If you don't want to grind you don't have to almost everything is level scaled so your level 37 casual friend can attack world bosses with a level 492 and have just as much fun. But for the more serious players you can grind and min max to get the extra edge but it is never too difficult.  \\n\\n-Things to do \\nI have played around 1,500 hours and have only scratched the surface of some of the content of this game. If you want to do group dungeons do that if you want to pvp do that if you want to enjoy the story and play solo do that and if you don't want to do something don't. I have not beaten the main story line which I plan to do and only tried my first arena with some cool people I met in a daily dungeon. So much content.\\n\\n-Community \\nVery friendly and helpful community never ran into a toxic player and I'm mostly in cyrodil (pvp area). Met and made so many friends playing this game. If you ever need something or help open up zone chat and be overwhelmed with support. Also noticed a high amount of female players more so than any other game I've played. \\n\\nCost\\nYou only need to buy base game everything is attainable for free in game. (I still spent way too much housing is the real end game XD and Pacrooti the Final Boss)\\n\\nCons with Suggestions\\n-------------------------\\n-PVP\\nPVP is fun but they do not care about the PVP community. An example is battle grounds where you used to be able to choose a game mode like team death match etc. now you are no longer allowed to choose it is random. Most players liked team death match and not so much the other game modes so now half of the players in the other modes still treat it as team death match. This was probably an attempt to make the other game modes played more but that is how the devs want people to play instead of what the community wants to play. Also cyrodil has been neglected massive pvp area. It would be awesome to add some excitement to the region and make these areas more like new world so these keeps mean something allowing guilds to get actual production from the mines in the form of materials. (Again Still Fun)\\n\\nAdvice for new players\\n------------------------\\nChoose the race and class you want to play you can do almost anything with every race and class yes some builds are more efficient than others but if you are a meta player you already know your build before you download. Also all your perks and things can be upgraded later.\\n\\nUpgrade Horse Every Day!!!! and max out speed first.\\n\\nequipment does not really matter until level 160 either use a full training set (ask someone in zone chat). Or experiment. \\n\\nFind a Guild! or 2 or 5. There are guilds for everything from social to trading find a few that match your interests and you will definitely make some friends. \\n\\nDon't grind just do what you want and you will gain XP fast. But... Daily dungeons and battlegrounds are good for XP at the start. \\n\\nYou don't like your starting area go somewhere else. \\n\\n$$$ stuff, Subscription is nice but not necessary play some before you make the decision to subscribe. If you get crates sell the consumables for gems. Again you can get everything for free even those dlc zones have free access at certain parts of the year and in my 1500 hours I have only fully completed three zones.\",\n",

       "      <td>ORIGINAL REVIEW Posted: Nov 27, 2016:\\nExtremely fun and addictive game! That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\\n\\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\\n\\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\\n\\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\\n\\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Reviewed version: 1.06\\n\\n[b]The Positives[/b]\\n\\n- Graphics, especially with RT, are absolutely next gen and stunning.\\n- Story and most \"real\"/major side quests are for the most part well done.\\n- Voice acting, especially by female V, is top notch, as are the production values in general - animations, motion capture, facial animations, lip sync.\\n- The City is beautiful, detailed and sprawling, just the right size to not be too overwhelming but to have a lot of room and variance. It is a perfect base for things to come, hopefully, as right now there is just nothing there - see under Negatives.\\n- The Cyberware system is pretty fun and useful to augment your character or make up for its shortcomings. Also it's the only system in the game that actually gives you a meaningful feeling of progression and increasing power, especially the double jump which is a total game changer.\\n- Stealth is relatively fun and usually a viable option - even if it's always realistically faster and easier to just kill everything guns blazing due to how unbalanced the game as a whole is.\\n\\n[b]Neutral[/b]\\n\\n- Combat is just average, serviceable, but nothing to write home about.\\n- Driving is relatively bad compared to other similar games such as GTA series, but it does its job, except the damn zoomed-in Minimap which will make you miss every turn if you are driving more than 50 mph.\\n\\n[b]Negatives[/b]\\n\\nUnfortunately the category where most points will have to go.\\n\\n- BUGS. The amount of bugs in this game is absolutely insane - I've never played a buggier game and that includes early access and Beta titles. Literally every aspect of the game is bugged heavily, some are easier to notice, some harder. Many of them are, at least, easily fixed with a Load game, but they happen often enough to pull you out of the world every few min. And some are huge and make entire game systems not function - such as most armor mods not working at all, or perks not working as intended.\\n\\n- OPEN WORLD as a whole is extremely underdeveloped and shallow - basically non existant. Outside of the 100% scripted missions, and Paint-the-map gigs and NCPD jobs (most of which are the same - come here, kill and loot, job done), there is no pedestrian AI at all, no Police AI, no reputation system of any sort - you just kill a million members from each gang and they all still love you and their bosses still work with you without a word, no fun activities, no hangouts with love interest/ buddies, no car customization, no property buying or at least apartment customization (nor any reason to visit it ever)... Many basic things missing, even stuff that appeared in other games such as GTA 3 20 years ago.\\n\\n- ITEMIZATION is probably the worst I have ever seen in an RPG. You have literally a couple of guns, a baseball bat, a few bladed weapons... and that's it. They all get random “quality”, and they scale with your level. The system where items get a random number of mod slots is just the worst - for example you can find Legendary items with 0-4 mod slots. Legendary with 0 mod slots is EXACTLY THE SAME as just a white item of that level (??!). So you are forced to savescum to obtain Legendaries with max mod slots, which you can already do as early as lvl 8, and from there you can just keep crafting Armadillo mod (which scales with your level and you can even craft Epic versions without having the Perk for Epic crafting) and never worry about any items ever again, they just become an annoyance. Iconic/unique items serve no purpose at all as they are always much worse than just random things you already wear - unless you invest 20 points into Crafting to be able to upgrade them to Legendary quality. And if you do that you lose most of your combat/stealth/ hacking potency so it's definitely not worth it to get a 5% better item. Leading to...\\n\\n- BALANCE: Non existant. I played at Hard from the beginning and I was able to 1 shot most enemies including bosses through the entire game with just 1 Katana strike to the head. Just from buying a new legendary Katana on the same vendor every 10 or so levels. Once you stack some Armadillo mods you become completely invulnerable to enemy bullet fire - but somehow still get 1 shot by any explosion or melee weapon. I guess this is an error in damage calculations, i.e. a bug, but that's how it is at the time of writing this review.\\n\\n- NO REPLAYABILITY / CHOICES DON'T MATTER: Unfortunately I don't see the game having any replay value due to having basically NO meaningful choices at all. The origin story just gives you some unique dialogue which doesn't really ever change the quest or dialogue in a meaningful way. Regarding the story, I can already see it being a lot worse on subsequent playthroughs as a heavy focus is put on just slowly walking/ driving and talking from objective to objective, in completely linear missions with very little to no player agency. Once you already know what's going to happen, I just don't see it being fun.\\n\\n- PACING is completely broken as well. If you do gigs/ NCPD missions you will very quickly outlevel the entire content and have all quests at \"Very low\" threat level until the end of the game. Also towards the end you will find yourself in a situation where you have several side quest chains unresolved and have to spend hours driving around the town waiting for people to call you and give you next parts of the quest - while on main quest you are already at the \"point of no return\". What can easily happen is that you think you are done with all sidequests and you just go finish the game - without ever knowing you were supposed to wait for 72h for another call to continue the chain.\\n\\n- SCRIPTED AND OPEN WORLD DON'T MIX WELL - By this I mean situations where you kill a guy in a quest... and then you reach him in the main quest later on and not only is he alive but you both act as if you just met. This happens on several occasions. Also it's pretty funny when you have a scripted car chase as part of a quest and you can see the regular cars keep disappearing all around you, so the scripted ones that are supposed to cut you off on intersections can spawn in instead - it looks insanely amateurish and completely takes you out of the game. Or, I have a guy scan my cyberware during a quest and he calls it \"complete garbage\", while I actually am decked out in full BiS Legendary cyberware - just cause the script expects me to be lvl 10 at that point, while I'm actually 40. Way too many continuity errors like that everywhere.\\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\\nAll in all, as someone who considers Witcher 3 the best single player game of all time, I'm deeply disappointed by what Cyberpunk turned to be. The further I progressed in the game and the more I played around with its \"systems\" - or a lack thereof - the more apparent it was that most of the budget and development time went into the scripted quests, while basically all other elements are left criminally underdeveloped. CDPR turned from the golden son of gaming to worse than Bethesda overnight, seeing how they on purpose lied about many aspects and systems of the game that never made it in not even in a most basic form; not to even mention the bugs, nor the console situation.\\n\\nThat said, the game does have that certain \"something\" that makes you wanna login and play, so it it not outside of the realm of possibility for CDPR to actually make it a great game it was supposed to be, a few years down the line. However after finishing the entire game I'm doubting it a bit as there's just too much wrong with it - for starters they will need at least 6 months of heavily working on the game just to fix most of the bugs - so without any gameplay additions or enhancements.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The game looks absolutely amazing, Night City is probably the most visually stunning environment I have seen in a game. The problem is, that's about all this game has going for it. Yes it looks amazing, but everything else is lacking. \\n\\nLet's start with the character customization. In all the marketing we saw, style and body modification were shown to be a huge part of what this  game would be about. What we got, however, was unremarkable. Aside from customizable genitals (which except for in the inventory menu, you will never see again after you've created your character) this character creator had no more depth than your average character customization in games, and in a lot of areas, it had less. Many of the NPCs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that. In terms of cybernetics that affect your appearance, all you really have are the little bits of metal on your face. To make matters even worse, once you've created your V, that's it. You can't change your appearance any more. Despite the fact that the ads implied in Night City, you could change your appearance and and body on a whim, you can't. Not even your hairstyle or tattoos, let alone cybernetics.\\n\\nThe next thing I want to talk about is character choice. Aside from the intro mission, and maybe a few bits at the end of the game, you really don't have much control over V's personality or choices. V essentially becomes the same character no matter what you choose. For example, I chose Corpo as my lifepath. After the very first introductory mission, V went from being a cold, calculating Corpo completely devoid of morals, to being a passionate, tough talking mercenary. I had no say in the personality shift, the change just happens, and it happens in literally minutes.\\n\\nThe world itself was also a let down. I went into this thinking it would be a sprawling open world with lots of exploring to do and interesting things to discover. But what I found was, while it is clear that tons of effort went into crafting the beautiful city, it really doesn't go deeper than the surface level. Yes there are tons of NPCs walking around, but the city does not live and breathe. It is completely static, and the AI leaves a lot to be desired. As many have already pointed out, the AI seem to be the absolute bare minimum, they walk, talk, and run away if you scare them. That's it. The police AI are a complete joke. If you get in trouble with the law, police just spawn feet away from you, no matter where you are. In the middle of the desert, on a freeway, on top of a building, police just materialize out of nowhere.\\n\\nThe story definitely had it's moments, and I did very much like the ending I got. I was very disappointed that you do not get to go back to Night City afterwards, and see how your decisions affect the world. Instead, you are simply given the opportunity to go back to your last save before starting the final mission. I found that story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. Accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment.\\n\\nThe cybernetics and gear system was weird, to say the least. Even playing on hard, I never had any reason to get into crafting or cybernetics to be powerful enough to get by. I wanted to get into cybernetics more, but even doing all the side missions and gigs didn't yield enough money to be able to afford the good stuff. By the end of the game. I had only added one or two new cybernetics to my character. \\n\\nI was also disappointed with V's apartment. You get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer ones. On top of that, there is no reason to ever return to the apartment you do have. Yes you can stash stuff there, but that's it, other than that it is pointless and you can forget it even exists. I also found it strange that there was no way to customize or upgrade cars. You spend so much time in your vehicles, but you can't do anything with them besides drive from point A to point B.\\n\\nThis is tough, because if it had been advertised as what it is, I might have thought it was a really good game. But aside from visually, this game was not nearly as deep as I got the impression it would be. Part of the blame lies with me, after the Witcher 3 I had faith that CDPR would deliver another masterpiece. That was an unrealistic expectation I realize. But at the same time, I don't think anyone can deny that this game is not what we were told it would be. Yes it  was probably largely the media that made expectations so high, but I do believe that CDPR did, in this case, overpromise and underdeliver. \\n\\nIf Steam had a numerical rating system, I'd probably give the game a 7/10. But because I have to choose recommend or don't recommend, I have to choose the negative option. I might reconsider later on after patches and DLC, but I believe many of the problems cannot be fixed in that way.</td>\n",

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\\n\\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\\n\\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\\n\\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\\n\\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.   \n",

       "9172  Reviewed version: 1.06\\n\\n[b]The Positives[/b]\\n\\n- Graphics, especially with RT, are absolutely next gen and stunning.\\n- Story and most \"real\"/major side quests are for the most part well done.\\n- Voice acting, especially by female V, is top notch, as are the production values in general - animations, motion capture, facial animations, lip sync.\\n- The City is beautiful, detailed and sprawling, just the right size to not be too overwhelming but to have a lot of room and variance. It is a perfect base for things to come, hopefully, as right now there is just nothing there - see under Negatives.\\n- The Cyberware system is pretty fun and useful to augment your character or make up for its shortcomings. Also it's the only system in the game that actually gives you a meaningful feeling of progression and increasing power, especially the double jump which is a total game changer.\\n- Stealth is relatively fun and usually a viable option - even if it's always realistically faster and easier to just kill everything guns blazing due to how unbalanced the game as a whole is.\\n\\n[b]Neutral[/b]\\n\\n- Combat is just average, serviceable, but nothing to write home about.\\n- Driving is relatively bad compared to other similar games such as GTA series, but it does its job, except the damn zoomed-in Minimap which will make you miss every turn if you are driving more than 50 mph.\\n\\n[b]Negatives[/b]\\n\\nUnfortunately the category where most points will have to go.\\n\\n- BUGS. The amount of bugs in this game is absolutely insane - I've never played a buggier game and that includes early access and Beta titles. Literally every aspect of the game is bugged heavily, some are easier to notice, some harder. Many of them are, at least, easily fixed with a Load game, but they happen often enough to pull you out of the world every few min. And some are huge and make entire game systems not function - such as most armor mods not working at all, or perks not working as intended.\\n\\n- OPEN WORLD as a whole is extremely underdeveloped and shallow - basically non existant. Outside of the 100% scripted missions, and Paint-the-map gigs and NCPD jobs (most of which are the same - come here, kill and loot, job done), there is no pedestrian AI at all, no Police AI, no reputation system of any sort - you just kill a million members from each gang and they all still love you and their bosses still work with you without a word, no fun activities, no hangouts with love interest/ buddies, no car customization, no property buying or at least apartment customization (nor any reason to visit it ever)... Many basic things missing, even stuff that appeared in other games such as GTA 3 20 years ago.\\n\\n- ITEMIZATION is probably the worst I have ever seen in an RPG. You have literally a couple of guns, a baseball bat, a few bladed weapons... and that's it. They all get random “quality”, and they scale with your level. The system where items get a random number of mod slots is just the worst - for example you can find Legendary items with 0-4 mod slots. Legendary with 0 mod slots is EXACTLY THE SAME as just a white item of that level (??!). So you are forced to savescum to obtain Legendaries with max mod slots, which you can already do as early as lvl 8, and from there you can just keep crafting Armadillo mod (which scales with your level and you can even craft Epic versions without having the Perk for Epic crafting) and never worry about any items ever again, they just become an annoyance. Iconic/unique items serve no purpose at all as they are always much worse than just random things you already wear - unless you invest 20 points into Crafting to be able to upgrade them to Legendary quality. And if you do that you lose most of your combat/stealth/ hacking potency so it's definitely not worth it to get a 5% better item. Leading to...\\n\\n- BALANCE: Non existant. I played at Hard from the beginning and I was able to 1 shot most enemies including bosses through the entire game with just 1 Katana strike to the head. Just from buying a new legendary Katana on the same vendor every 10 or so levels. Once you stack some Armadillo mods you become completely invulnerable to enemy bullet fire - but somehow still get 1 shot by any explosion or melee weapon. I guess this is an error in damage calculations, i.e. a bug, but that's how it is at the time of writing this review.\\n\\n- NO REPLAYABILITY / CHOICES DON'T MATTER: Unfortunately I don't see the game having any replay value due to having basically NO meaningful choices at all. The origin story just gives you some unique dialogue which doesn't really ever change the quest or dialogue in a meaningful way. Regarding the story, I can already see it being a lot worse on subsequent playthroughs as a heavy focus is put on just slowly walking/ driving and talking from objective to objective, in completely linear missions with very little to no player agency. Once you already know what's going to happen, I just don't see it being fun.\\n\\n- PACING is completely broken as well. If you do gigs/ NCPD missions you will very quickly outlevel the entire content and have all quests at \"Very low\" threat level until the end of the game. Also towards the end you will find yourself in a situation where you have several side quest chains unresolved and have to spend hours driving around the town waiting for people to call you and give you next parts of the quest - while on main quest you are already at the \"point of no return\". What can easily happen is that you think you are done with all sidequests and you just go finish the game - without ever knowing you were supposed to wait for 72h for another call to continue the chain.\\n\\n- SCRIPTED AND OPEN WORLD DON'T MIX WELL - By this I mean situations where you kill a guy in a quest... and then you reach him in the main quest later on and not only is he alive but you both act as if you just met. This happens on several occasions. Also it's pretty funny when you have a scripted car chase as part of a quest and you can see the regular cars keep disappearing all around you, so the scripted ones that are supposed to cut you off on intersections can spawn in instead - it looks insanely amateurish and completely takes you out of the game. Or, I have a guy scan my cyberware during a quest and he calls it \"complete garbage\", while I actually am decked out in full BiS Legendary cyberware - just cause the script expects me to be lvl 10 at that point, while I'm actually 40. Way too many continuity errors like that everywhere.\\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\\nAll in all, as someone who considers Witcher 3 the best single player game of all time, I'm deeply disappointed by what Cyberpunk turned to be. The further I progressed in the game and the more I played around with its \"systems\" - or a lack thereof - the more apparent it was that most of the budget and development time went into the scripted quests, while basically all other elements are left criminally underdeveloped. CDPR turned from the golden son of gaming to worse than Bethesda overnight, seeing how they on purpose lied about many aspects and systems of the game that never made it in not even in a most basic form; not to even mention the bugs, nor the console situation.\\n\\nThat said, the game does have that certain \"something\" that makes you wanna login and play, so it it not outside of the realm of possibility for CDPR to actually make it a great game it was supposed to be, a few years down the line. However after finishing the entire game I'm doubting it a bit as there's just too much wrong with it - for starters they will need at least 6 months of heavily working on the game just to fix most of the bugs - so without any gameplay additions or enhancements.   \n",

The problem is, that's about all this game has going for it. Yes it looks amazing, but everything else is lacking. \\n\\nLet's start with the character customization. In all the marketing we saw, style and body modification were shown to be a huge part of what this  game would be about. What we got, however, was unremarkable. Aside from customizable genitals (which except for in the inventory menu, you will never see again after you've created your character) this character creator had no more depth than your average character customization in games, and in a lot of areas, it had less. Many of the NPCs in the game have cool looking cybernetic eyes, arms, and legs, but your character has no access to any of that. In terms of cybernetics that affect your appearance, all you really have are the little bits of metal on your face. To make matters even worse, once you've created your V, that's it. You can't change your appearance any more. Despite the fact that the ads implied in Night City, you could change your appearance and and body on a whim, you can't. Not even your hairstyle or tattoos, let alone cybernetics.\\n\\nThe next thing I want to talk about is character choice. Aside from the intro mission, and maybe a few bits at the end of the game, you really don't have much control over V's personality or choices. V essentially becomes the same character no matter what you choose. For example, I chose Corpo as my lifepath. After the very first introductory mission, V went from being a cold, calculating Corpo completely devoid of morals, to being a passionate, tough talking mercenary. I had no say in the personality shift, the change just happens, and it happens in literally minutes.\\n\\nThe world itself was also a let down. I went into this thinking it would be a sprawling open world with lots of exploring to do and interesting things to discover. But what I found was, while it is clear that tons of effort went into crafting the beautiful city, it really doesn't go deeper than the surface level. Yes there are tons of NPCs walking around, but the city does not live and breathe. It is completely static, and the AI leaves a lot to be desired. As many have already pointed out, the AI seem to be the absolute bare minimum, they walk, talk, and run away if you scare them. That's it. The police AI are a complete joke. If you get in trouble with the law, police just spawn feet away from you, no matter where you are. In the middle of the desert, on a freeway, on top of a building, police just materialize out of nowhere.\\n\\nThe story definitely had it's moments, and I did very much like the ending I got. I was very disappointed that you do not get to go back to Night City afterwards, and see how your decisions affect the world. Instead, you are simply given the opportunity to go back to your last save before starting the final mission. I found that story missions, side missions, and gigs all played pretty much the same way. Accept a job, go in either guns blazing or silently, find something, then get out and accept your payment.\\n\\nThe cybernetics and gear system was weird, to say the least. Even playing on hard, I never had any reason to get into crafting or cybernetics to be powerful enough to get by. I wanted to get into cybernetics more, but even doing all the side missions and gigs didn't yield enough money to be able to afford the good stuff. By the end of the game. I had only added one or two new cybernetics to my character. \\n\\nI was also disappointed with V's apartment. You get one apartment, you can't get new or nicer ones. On top of that, there is no reason to ever return to the apartment you do have. Yes you can stash stuff there, but that's it, other than that it is pointless and you can forget it even exists. I also found it strange that there was no way to customize or upgrade cars. You spend so much time in your vehicles, but you can't do anything with them besides drive from point A to point B.\\n\\nThis is tough, because if it had been advertised as what it is, I might have thought it was a really good game. But aside from visually, this game was not nearly as deep as I got the impression it would be. Part of the blame lies with me, after the Witcher 3 I had faith that CDPR would deliver another masterpiece. That was an unrealistic expectation I realize. But at the same time, I don't think anyone can deny that this game is not what we were told it would be. Yes it  was probably largely the media that made expectations so high, but I do believe that CDPR did, in this case, overpromise and underdeliver. \\n\\nIf Steam had a numerical rating system, I'd probably give the game a 7/10. But because I have to choose recommend or don't recommend, I have to choose the negative option. I might reconsider later on after patches and DLC, but I believe many of the problems cannot be fixed in that way.   \n",
