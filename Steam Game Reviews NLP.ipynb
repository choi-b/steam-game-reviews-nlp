       "  'review': 'No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it. \\n\\nWhen you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.\\n\\nYou win or you learn, you never lose.\\n\\n[b] CS will never die. [/b]\\n\\nEdit: Source 2 is still not out. You can play on 128 tick rate servers on third party clients like FaceIt, ESEA, 5E Play etc.',\n",

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\\n\\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\\n\\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it\\'s F2P i feel like it\\'s gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\\n\\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I\\'ve gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn\\'t a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\\n\\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn\\'t a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren\\'t.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in  the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.\\nIt was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. \\n\\nSome years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. \\n\\nWe formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.\\nHowever, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called \"CS Promod\" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.\\n\\nAfter a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm\\'s ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. \\n\\nCS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro\\'s do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol\\' days (from what i\\'ve read).\\n\\nThough it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. \\n\\nSince all those years i\\'ve tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.\\n\\nHowever if you\\'re looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.\\n\\nI hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community. \\n\\nBest Regards\\nKnight',\n",

There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.\\n\\nI played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product \\n\\nCounter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).\\n\\nBecause a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.\\n\\nIt was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).\\n\\nPlaying Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).\\n\\nPlaying Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.\\n\\nIf you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.\\n\\nIn the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.\",\n",

Personally started playing in 2014 and regularly playing since has decent graphics for an FPS shooting game and can be played on low-end pcs as well. This is one of the games first games that got me into gaming and I wanna say it gave me a lot of experience. CSGO is not an ordinary game, to perfect it you gotta have extraordinary hearing and be able to concentrate.

       "  'review': 'I am 41 years old and probably one of the oldest players on Apex Legends servers. I have to say I enjoy this game a lot. I have been playing FPS games since the original Doom, and I played Unreal Tournament (UT) and Quake 3 a lot when they were launched on 1999. To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS. \\nThis is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation,  good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay. I am married with children and still try to play a few games every night since I found this gem. And best part, it is FREE!! You should definitely give it a try.',\n",

       "  'review': \"You open the game and finish your 3000 word essay that's due tomorrow while it loads you into the main menu. You pray they fed the server hamsters today as you queue for a game. You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.\\n\\n10/10. Def recommend\",\n",

You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"out of all the BRs i've played extensively (PUBG, Warzone, Apex, Danger Zone, Fortnite) this is the one that i actually continue to enjoy.  Warzone is way too sweaty, PUBG's the engine lag is too unforgivable, Fortnite is too goofy, and Danger Zone has too little to offer.\\n\\nThe movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.\\n\\nThe legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can.  And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.\\n\\nif you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about. Thank you EA. You truly have the reverse Midas touch, where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo.\",\n",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes.

       "  'review': \"[h1] ♦️ Apex Legends [/h1]\\n[b] Apex Legends [/b] is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, [b] Apex Legends [/b] proves it is here to stay.\\n\\n[h1] Monetization [/h1]\\n→ Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.\\n\\n[h1] Gunplay [/h1]\\n→ Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.\\n\\n→ One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes. \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992578590\\n[h1] Game Modes[/h1]\\n→ Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.\\n\\n[h1] Movement [/h1]\\n→ Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance. \\n\\n[h1] Looting [/h1]\\n→ A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme. \\n\\n→ Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.\\n\\n→ There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well. \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992381162\\n[h1] Roster [/h1]\\n→ With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992381274\\n[h1] Map Design [/h1]\\n→ There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.\\n\\n[h1] Visuals & Sound [/h1]\\n→ Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards. \\n\\n→ The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying [b] boom [/b]. The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.\\n\\n[h1] ♦️ Conclusion [/h1]\\nApex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an [b] Auto [/b] play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play. \\n[h3] Overall Score 9/10 [/h3]\\n\\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b][u]Game-play :[/u][/b] \\n\\n- Its awesome if you have a good PC with decent graphics card installed otherwise god can help.\\n- Characters are great and I like their voices. :D.\\n- Best when you communicate and play with friends otherwise randoms will either make you mad or make you hero. \\n- You will find less people who actually talks if u are random.\\n- You will feel great when you actually win which is like <5% of your total game-play.\\n- Various game modes are there where you can switch which will make you busy.\\n- If you play regularly you will find various new events, which if you play will surely give you various in-game items guaranteed.\\n\\n[b][u]Cost :[/u][/b] \\n- If you are rich just buy the related character and get going.\\n- If you are fond of skins you either need to buy coins or wait and grind and wait for the skins to pop-up from apex packs.\\n- There are new events and characters which get released at every quarter, which you need to but for 950 coins, which either you need to buy or grind.\\n\\n[b][u]Issues Faced :[/u][/b]\\n-Whenever there is any big update, there are lots of server issues specifically in Singapore ones which I play.\\n- There are also many bugs which comes up sometime like not able to connect to server, server crashes, visibility issues in games ans so on which are many times known or either random.\\n- Also, apart from the anti cheat, there are also hackers which are difficult sometimes but surely are there.\\n- And last but not the least, ranking system is a joke. I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.\\n\\n[b][u]General Comment and recommendations :[/u][/b] \\n- Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth. So a big thumps up for that.\\n\\n\\nAnyways thanks for reading my review, I am still playing it and love it everyday. Cheers!!!',\n",

       "  'review': 'Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Excellent Movement.\\n- Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good.\\n- Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion.\\n - New legends and weapons added every season.\\n- Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh.\\n- Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass.\\n- Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season\\'s battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted).\\n- Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc.\\n- You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !)\\n- Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! )\\n- Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18.\\n- In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming.\\n- Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is \"we are working on it\" etc.\\n- Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets.\\n- Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can\\'t even get into a game.\\n\\n- SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3  and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.\\n\\nThe main reason why I can\\'t recommend this game to new players is because I don\\'t see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don\\'t have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience. Cheaters are still rampant, servers are held together by spit and chewing gum and each update brings new issues which takes them weeks to fix.\\n\\nAt the end of the day this is the analogy I can give for Apex Legends : Think of an amazing recipe, lots of fresh ingredients, high quality meat, lovely kitchen but they use gutter water and rusted broken pots to prepare it in.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don\\'t play these types of games - they\\'re just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are [i]really[/i] into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I\\'ve formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.\\n\\n[h1]Do I think Apex Legends is good?[/h1]\\nHonestly...yes. I do. I didn\\'t expect it but I\\'ve been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that\\'s enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nThere are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let\\'s break them down point by point.\\n\\n- [b]Gun play[/b]\\nThe guns in Apex are [i]satisfying[/i] to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I\\'d choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say \"hey I died but I had fun\".\\nNot everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can\\'t just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying.\\nOn top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don\\'t think they work very well and they aren\\'t anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there\\'s memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it\\'s because they just really don\\'t fit in with the way this game wants you to play it.\\nTo clarify - I\\'m not saying they\\'re useless, I\\'m just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.\\n\\n- [b]Abilities[/b]\\nThis game\\'s abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren\\'t integrated into gameplay properly. It\\'s the one thing that I dislike about this game being that  you have no idea what you\\'re getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once.\\nBut perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they\\'re conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not.\\nOverall though, I appreciate that this game doesn\\'t make it so you [i]need[/i] to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you [i]can[/i] use if you need it.\\n\\n- [b]Movement[/b]\\nI love this game\\'s movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it\\'s no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels [i]really good[/i] and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter.\\nThe only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it\\'s super satisfying but [i]man[/i] does it feel awkward initially.\\n\\n[h1]Monetization:[/h1]\\nThis is a free-to-play game, it\\'s natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they\\'ve created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how\\'s the monetization in this game? Honestly I\\'m incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.\\n\\n- [b]DLC[/b]\\nThe DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I\\'m hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it\\'s just a shame altogether - I\\'d personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.\\n\\n- [b]Lootboxes[/b]\\nI think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I\\'m not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I\\'ve gathered they don\\'t do limited-time lootbox drops so they\\'re avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they\\'re there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.\\n\\n- [b]Battle Pass[/b]\\nThis is one thing I actively dislike about this game\\'s monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like \"Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin\", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you \"buy premium to get this skin!\", at which point I just wanna tell the game to fuck off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics, Sound & Optimization:[/h1]\\nHow are the other aspects of the game?\\n\\n- [b]Graphics[/b]\\nFor being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching.\\nSome gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It\\'s not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.\\n\\n- [b]Sound[/b]\\nThe sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying.\\nThe music isn\\'t anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don\\'t really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about.\\nThe voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.\\n\\n- [b]Optimization[/b]\\nI think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn\\'t seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it\\'s just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\nThere are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it\\'s satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn\\'t recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say \"thats just a skill issue\" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex\\'s skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level.\\nI hope this review is helpful.\\nsincerely, a concerned player.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] The Best Battle Royale on the Market with some Faults [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n+ Smoothest Movement\\n+ Satisfying gunplay\\n+ Every animation & sound effect is so distinct, you can tell where and what is coming towards you.\\n+ Stressful but rewarding final circles in Ranked\\n+ Crossplay with friends on consoles (Nintendo Switch players are free kills)\\n+ Easy to complete battle pass within a month of playtime.\\n+ Beautiful maps such as Olympus & Stormpoint to the sweaty competitive maps, World's Edge & King's Canyon.\\n\\n[b] Neutral: [/b]\\n- Shares the same universe as Titanfall but the lore is okayish.\\n- I honestly think Apex has the worst cosmetic team next to Halo Infinite. Some of them are really just nice but exclusive to the battle pass or collection events. If you do find a really good skin that isn't a recolor of the default model, be ready to shell out 18/35/50 dollars up to 160+. It's honestly a cycle with this game, you get 3 seasons of good skins and 3 seasons of mediocre or trash skins.\\n- Pro games have teams compete against full mouse & keyboard vs full controller or a mix of both inputs in an endless battle that blends so well together.\\n- If you don't like the battle royale mode, there is a lite economy round based 3v3 mode to mess around in called Arenas.\\n- Limited time game modes like Control (Domination if you ever played COD) should be in the base game.\\n- Like every modern game today, the matchmaking system pits you against or with pro players, new players, or the average 2 hour free time guy.\\n- Since the game is free to play, there's lootboxes, completely random. Some get Heirlooms Shards (0.2% chance of dropping) early on, while it took me 800 hours. Heirloom Shards are for melee weapons or prestige Legends skins that do not affect gameplay. There is a bunch of crap in the lootboxes to further your chances of not getting what you want.\\n- Characters aside from the default roster need to be bought with in game currency or real money. They also cannot be tested in the firing range.\\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n- Somehow there's a game breaking bug every season.\\n- Squads/Quads (teams of 4) doesn't exist, leaving that one friend all alone while the rest play Trios. Nor is there a true solos mode.\\n- Servers are really bad causing desyc/bullets aren't registering, crashing, or disconnects.\\n- Enemy footsteps sometimes doesn't work.\\n- Joke of an esport; the recent ALGS 2022 had players dc, visas denied, teams teleporting across the map and dying to their deaths, or players gettings covid - forcing teams to play as a duo instead as a trio. The tournament organizers didn't want to restart despite all these problems. Also they didn't even play on LAN?? The event was connected to the nearest server. Even the custom matches for pros to scrim in, didn't work for a while.\\n- The balancing or design team whatever you want to call them is very questionable. You have 2 Legends, Seer & Valkyrie dominating tournaments without a single nerf in sight meanwhile, Lifeline's old shield passive was reworked into a new Legend, we have two of the same character now. Which leads onto my next point, a few characters share the same ability just slightly different. Sooner or later the game will become a massive unbalancing mess than it already is. Then finally, some Legends that need a buff stay untouched for a very long time.\\n- Easy anti-cheat would sometimes blue screen my computer or crash my game back to the desktop once in a blue moon. \\n- The lack of a spectating system without going into match or a dedicated match history.\\n\\n[h1] Recommended Youtube / Twitch Content [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Pro Mouse and Keyboard [/b]\\n- ImperialHal, Reps, Albralelie, HisWattson, Apryze, Sweetdreams, Hardecki, Nafen, Taisheen, Mande, sYnceD, Monsoon, Rogue\\n\\n[b] Movement Gods [/b]\\n- Aceu, Stormen, Taxi2g, Faide, Crylix\\n\\n[b] Pro Controller Demons [/b]\\n- ChaoticMuch, Verhulst, Daltoosh, Staynaughty, Knoqd, Pandxrz, Snip3down, Thekine\\n\\n[b] Casual / Funny [/b]\\n- Rag Tagg, Lej, Emerald Gemerald & the butt load of vtubers on Apex\\n\\n[b] Informative [/b]\\n- TheGamingMerchant, Mokeysniper, & ottr\\n\\n[b] Fan Animations [/b]\\n- Cheetah, Tooncraft, Hoxdolum, & dopatwo\",\n",

Its good, but has a few downsides that I cant ignore.[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th]Is it worth buying?[/th]\\n        [td]The initial cost is 0$, so yes. However, if you have any plans whatesover on playing more of the game, you will have to pay probably 80$+. Is the dlcs worth buying? I would say it depends on the person. For a casual I would say its better to just find a new game, for those who really like destiny, its not a problem to spend a little extra on additional content.[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th]Content & Replay Value:[/th]\\n        [td]Replay value when it comes to story I would say is close to 0, but the replay value of the pvp and raids are very good. There are at least 100+ hours of quality content here, and much more if you really enjoy the game.[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\\n\\n[h2]Pros[/h2]\\n[b]1.[/b]\\nThe gunplay is fantastic. Guns pack a proper punch. The handling feels solid, and there is nothing better than sniping another guardian in the head. The movement slightly differs from class to class but the mix of dodges and jumps provides more flexibility and a greater skill gap. There are certainly some balancing needed, however all in all I would say the gunplay is great.\\n\\n[b]2.[/b]\\nThe dungeons and raids are a great combination of puzzles, combat, parkour and boss fights. To finish a raid you pretty much have to have a mic and communicate with your team, but as long as your team consists of your friends its gonna be a great time. However, if your team is filled with randoms, prepare for a horrible time.\\n\\n[b]3.[/b]\\nThe uniqueness of exotic perks are truly where destiny shines. It can range from \"Melee kills restore health for a short duration.\" to \"Sliding reflects projectiles\". These exotics can drastically change your playstyle and makes the replay value a whole lot better.\\n\\n[h2]Cons[/h2]\\n[b]1.[/b]\\nYes this game is free. However, if you plan on playing any of the end game, or have any cool or unique armor or guns, you will have to spend money on DLCs. Playing this game without any DLCs is like eating french fries without salt, its possible... but are you okay?\\n\\n[b]2.[/b]\\nIf none of your friends play destiny 2, good luck with the end game content. You will be constantly reminded of how brain dead randoms can be. Also, playing destiny alone can be extremely boring. I personally NEVER boot the game if none of my friends are down to join. This may be very subjective but I can not play this game alone and not go insane.\\n\\n[b]3.[/b]\\nThe general destiny community is pretty decent. Don\\'t get me wrong, I have made some great friends through raids and dungeons, however the illusion of a friendly non-toxic community dissolves once you enter ranked PvP in any form. It is insane how many entitled bottom fraggers I have met. So many people join, don\\'t say a word the whole game, gets 27 damage, and rages once you lose. PvP can be great fun, just highly unlikely to achieve with randoms. Now there are exceptions to this as well, just extremely rare.\\n\\n[b]4.[/b]\\nDestiny does this fun little thing called \"Vaulting content\" which in long terms means removing content youve paid for. This is extremely infuriating. Removing the less actively played content players paid for, vaulting them, and \"maybe re-using them\" is not an acceptable excuse and a certain way to lose players. Entire planets disappearing, huge storylines gone, several guns and armor pieces no longer able to acquire. This is very unfortunate for new players as they will most likely never experience those missions and never get their hands on the items.\\n\\n[b]5.[/b]\\nThe matchmaking in this game is crazy. I can not tell you the amount of times me and my friend has queued for a match, and our teammate gets 0-25 damage per round, while every enemy has at least 3k hours in game and hits you the split second you peek. The matchmaking is truly a joke. You can not play this game seriously without having teammates before you queue.\\n\\n[h2] Bugs & issues[/h2]\\nAs for ghost melee and the revive feature not working sometimes, its rather self explanatory. Sometimes when you hit a melee, it doesn\\'t deal any damage and sometimes when you revive someone, they doesn\\'t actually get revived. This can lead to you loosing a very intense fight due to something that shouldn\\'t have happened, causing frustration, anger and maybe even sadness. \\n\\n[h2] Technical[/h2]\\nI use an i5 10400f with a 2070 super 8gb Vram and 32gb ram with a 280hz 1080p monitor, using a combination of mid to max settings and im sitting at around 180fps in pvp on average. It may drop down to around 140, but its never unstable or causes drastic fps drops. You will most likely not have any trouble with fps or performance if you have a decent PC.\\n\\n[h2]Verdict: Good, but not great[/h2]\\nAll in all, Destiny 2 offers fun and satisfying PvP, unique armor and guns as well as fantastic raids and dungeons. Destiny 2 can be very enjoyable, but the negatives are too big to ignore. I give this game a 7/10.\\n\\n[table]    [tr] [td] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42637369/] Follow my Curator Page if you want to see more of my reviews!

       "  'review': 'With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\\n\\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn\\'t always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\\n\\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\\n\\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \\n\\nWith that said, dungeons (currently \\'The Shattered Throne\\', \\'Pit of Heresy\\', \\'Prophecy\\' which is free to all players, \\'Grasp of Avarice\\', \\'Duality\\', and \\'Spire of the Watcher\\') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, \\'Vow of the Disciple\\' from Witch Queen, as well as \\'Vault of Glass\\' and \\'King\\'s Fall\\' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don\\'t shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. \\'Tis only polite). \\n\\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it\\'s fine I guess, but I\\'ve never liked PvP that\\'s dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\\n\\nSome stuff just won\\'t be explained in game. It\\'s not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\\n\\nFor anything that you can\\'t easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we\\'d be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \\n\\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\\n\\nEyes up, guardian.\\n\\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS\\'s, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I\\'ve missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I\\'ll do my best to update this periodically. \\n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\\n\\n-----------------\\nTL:DR: It\\'s good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it\\'s free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you\\'re overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\\n-----------------\\n\\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\\n\\n    \\nBeginner\\'s Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\\n\\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\\n\\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\\n\\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\\n\\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\\n\\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\\n\\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\\n\\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

       "  'review': \"2017: Bought Destiny 2 & Season Pass for like $100. Did pretty much everything there was to do in the base game, Curse of Osiris and Warmind. Was sorely disappointed about the lack of content and amount of things to do. I had a good time with it, but I ultimately wrote the game off as a loss and walked away. Laughed at the thought of a year 2 season pass after getting burned so hard the first time.\\n\\n2018: Pretty much forgot Destiny 2 existed.\\n\\n2019: Continued forgetting Destiny 2 existed until October 1st. Decided to give New Light a try because screw it why not. I'm completely overwhelmed with how much the game has grown and the sheer amount of things to do. The game did a full 180 from what it was last time I played it. Within a couple days of New Light I went ahead and bought Forsaken and Shadowkeep because I felt like Bungie finally earned my money. Looking forward to reaching the light cap again, min/maxing stats and going for perfect weapon rolls.\\n\\nI'm so glad Bungie chose Steam over Epic. If Destiny 2 had gone to Epic instead this review wouldn't exist and Bungie wouldn't have my money. So, well done there guys.\",\n",

Because I CANNOT recommend this game to new players. Not in it\\'s current state. Not unless things improve.\\n\\nSTORY:\\nThe story of Destiny is rich and indepth. We\\'re far beyond the point where it was hidden in lore cards. DLC has fully cast characters, often good narrative beats, and is generally a good time.\\nSeasons have gone from being a thing with loot and an activity, to near episodic stories told over weeks.\\nThe story in Destiny has never been better...\\n\\nAnd never been worse.\\n\\nDue to the DVC, new players are locked out of two whole years of story, and soon to be a third.\\nThey miss out on critical character arcs, and narrative context for current events.\\nWhat content remains is a mix of old and new, clashing content and contexts that leave new players confused as to who is who, and where they\\'ve gone.\\n\\nACTIVITIES:\\nThere are a number of core playlists that offer casual and hardcore experiences. There is endgame content for those who thirst for it. There are seasonal activities that offer a variety of fun side activities. There are bounties, challenges, and triumphs to chase.\\nBut there used to be so much more.\\nSome of the most fun, and most rewarding activities are gone, and whilst the newer activities are fun...\\nThey fail to live up to the past so far. And they too are soon to vanish.\\n\\nCOST:\\nThis is where Destiny fails the most.\\nYou can buy:\\n- DLCs\\n- Seasons\\n- Cosmetic MTX\\n- Transmog MTX\\nAll of this can add up to a high cost, especially for newer players coming in.\\nAll of the \"free\" content has been stripped away to the core playlists, of which you are occasionally locked out of for the week if you don\\'t have the DLC, (nightfalls).\\nFurthermore, instead of some parts of vaulted content becoming free, (subclasses, activities, weapons), Bungie is instead making this an EXTRA cost in the form of a mini DLC.\\n\\nAll of this results in a horrendous experience for new players, who starting out:\\n- Are facing a (Technically) pay to win economy, where subclasses and weapons are locked behind DLC paywalls in PVP content.\\n- Are left with no guidance of what they can, or cannot do.\\n- Are limited to only a handful of core activities, of which sometimes are unavailable.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this game to a new player, because the red tape of what is and isn\\'t available behind which paywall and how long it\\'ll exist before it\\'s gone, and what isn\\'t going...\\nIs all too much.\\n\\nPlease Bungie. Fix your sh*t.\\nOther games do transmog right. Other games let you keep your season passes once the season is over because you brought it.\\nOther games don\\'t strip away story and content from both the free and paid players.\\nThe DVC is a necessary evil, but with each \\'vaulting\\' the new players are left with less, and everyone is left with a bigger mess.\\n\\nI know you can make this right. Please do so.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit: Jan 18, 2023: Bungie\\'s actually came out and made it a lot easier for newer players with more changes coming with the newest expansion on February 28th. To start, all armour mods are unlocked for everyone now by default. You used to have to visit a specific person every day to hope she sells the mods you needed. So that\\'s better. Coming with Lightfall more systems in the game are getting streamlined for easier understanding and working. Most of my issues here still stand, but as others have pointed out: buying from a third party site can be cheaper. I would like to amend this completely though. \"Unless something changes, which I don\\'t see happening soon..\" I will admit, I was wrong. These changes are very promising and I am hopeful that more and better changes will come. I would recommend trying the game and if you like it, look into buying some of the expansions.\\n\\nI know, I have 1200+ hours on Steam, I have more on Xbox before I moved over. This isn\\'t a meme though. I love this game, truly I do, there is nothing else like it. I have met so many friends, created so many memories, and got into a relationship because of this game. It\\'s amazing, incredibly fun, and a joy to millions. The problem is this game is so Anti-New Player it\\'s disgraceful. \\n\\nThe price to join is absurdly high, the fact that previous expansions don\\'t get price dropped to like $5 after a year is an insult. If you want to play everything in the game right now, you need to buy 3 Major Expansions that cost between like $40-$80 USD each. Then another $40 for the Season passes to get the content that arrives throughout the year. Then when the next major expansion comes out, it\\'ll cost you another like $100 to play that content. \\n\\nSay you can swallow that pill though and pick up the game. The tutorial is really, really bad and barely teaches you anything. It\\'s tedious to do on other characters if you wanted to experiment with other classes. And then once the tutorial is done, it throws you out into the world and says \"Good Luck!\". It might throw you into a seasonal story mission, but those are usually story based and require A. Knowledge of what\\'s going on. B. Only give you the first mission if you didn\\'t by the season pass. C. Puts you like 3/4ths of the way through an ongoing story of the year and refuses to make you play through it in order. If you\\'re lucky, it will just leave you with no clue of what to do, where to go, what any of the terms mean, nothing.\\n\\nSpeaking of terms, there is a lot. MMO levels and it is overwhelming with not a great way to learn it in game. You talking activities? Well you got: Patrols, Strikes, Nightfalls, Dungeons, Raids, Story Missions, Seasonal Missions, Gambit, Crucible, Trials of Osiris, Dares of Eternity. Wanna talk weapons? Kinetic, Energy, Special, Primary, Heavy/Power, Solar, Arc, Stasis, Void, Archetypes, Supers, Class Abilities, like 20 different Grenades, dozens of weapon perks. It tells you so little about what any of these mean. If you\\'re new, likely these are all just gibberish or mumbo jumbo.  \\n\\nIf you make it through all of that, and you start playing, and you start doing activities and browsing Twitter or Reddit you\\'ll eventually hit the hardest sell of them all. A lot of content has been removed from this game. A lot. Most of it was unused, but it also leaves anyone who picks up the game completely unaware of most things going on. Characters will address you as an old friend and you will have just met them 3 minutes ago. Characters will talk that have been out of the game for years now. People will make references to missions or levels or worlds that were incredible, but you\\'ll never be able to experience them. One of my favourite missions in the game is running through a destroyed human made structure, platforming and racing against time before it engages in a tough, all out firefight where you either run out of time or win and claim an incredibly strong gun. It\\'s gone. It\\'s been gone for almost two years now. It and so much else was just fun and FOMO just killed any chance of you, the reader, ever trying it.\\n\\nDestiny 2 has always been easy for me to describe. \"It\\'s the best game I will never recommend to anyone.\" Unless you have a friend helping you through and teaching you things, you\\'ll be alone in an ocean not knowing what to do next. Unless something changes, which I don\\'t see happening soon, I would avoid diving into this. Destiny 2 is incredible. There are so many great things I could have talked about: Gunplay is best in genre, Environments are breathtaking, raids are such a bonding experience with friends. But if you\\'re new to the game the cons will heavily outweight the pros, especially when so many problems are front loaded.',\n",

I REALLY miss the spoopyness of Shadowkeep and even Beyond Light was fun, but I feel like the game has lost the magic from the original campaigns, warts and all. I know they were running out of space (and so were our HDDs), but I just feel jilted that I can't go back and replay it all again, to discover the Dreaming City all over, to take on the Fallen and avenge Cayde, to kick Ghaul's ass and stand over the ruined Red Legion in victory...even delve into the Infinite Forest and look for Osiris (still the shortest/smallest DLC). Yeah, it may be nostalgia goggles, seeing only the good while forgetting the bad, but I miss it so damn much. Now? I have no desire to return. All my favorite rifles and exotics are nerfed into oblivion. The pinnacles I ground my ass off for are little more than dusty relics, and I'm just so...damn...tired.

       "  'review': 'Ok, I am going to give a brief but concise review on this wonderful bipolar game. \\n\\nIn summary: Most Destiny 2 players joking but correctly describe this game as \" I hate Destiny 2, its my favorite game\". \\n\\nFor those unknowing of Destiny 2\\'s gameplay loop, it may seem strange. But if you ever jump in, you will quickly understand why.\\n\\nThis is.... is a game for masochists. \\n\\nThere is soooooooo much to do and never enough hours in a week to do it all in. You will play for hours grinding away your life trying to get items in this game. \\n\\nIf you are a completionist OCD gamer, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST PLAYING THIS GAME. This game will trigger you in all the worst ways. There are FOMO yearly events on top of the tri monthly seasonal content that will have you obsessively playing away your life trying to impossibly do everything as quickly as possible before the events/seasons expire. \\n\\nI am not even touching the predatory Eververse store, thats just pure FOMO glitter bait. And you cannot escape that in any triple A game anymore. Not even a listed con, just a fact. \\n\\nWhat IS predatory however is Bungie\\'s nebulous changes of the game every few months to a year. If you drop this game for a bit and come back several months to a year later, its a completely different game literally due to their new content vault system. \\n\\nThe part that makes it nebulous is that they are vaulting paid DLC content you have previously purchased and played. Which is a huge red flag for new forms of predatory DLC FOMO. Literal FOMO for DLC purchases on top of the usual season pass exclusivity content. \\n\\nOnce again, if you are an OCD completionist. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It\\'s not good for your mental health. \\nIt\\'s a damn fun game, but you can get pulled in, in the worst ways. \\n\\nIf you enjoy this game casually, you are a stout soul because this game is for you. It\\'s fun for a few mindless hours, but for endgame playing, its a mindless grind that will have your soul wither away from either missing FOMO events because of IRL commitments or just the sheer amount of it you need to do to get the items you want to drop. \\n\\nI walked away from this game for my mental health and because I had an epiphany of how dangerous this game\\'s true predatory nature is. As well as the very dangerous DLC transaction model Bungie is positioning into place with Witch Queen. I refunded my WQ Digital Edition Deluxe because I am that concerned about it. \\n\\nIn conclusion: Fun game, but dangerous for people who have issues with controlling their impulses and time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Ah, Destiny. I love so much about this franchise. The gameplay, shooting, jumping, throwing lots of grenades, dismantling guns.. Destiny is a franchise I\\'ve spent a lot of time in. I\\'ve accomplished some of the hardest achievements in the game. Low man raid encounters, solo flawless dungeon completions, Conquerer seals, etc. \\n\\nMy honest opinion on this game is that it\\'s the best PvE FPS experience out there, ruined in multiple ways by problems that honestly shouldn\\'t be hard to fix or at least shouldn\\'t have been a problem for this long. I\\'ll start with the good:\\n\\n- Top tier gunplay and class feel\\n- The in game movement is an underrated part of the experience in my opinion, each class has it\\'s own traversal tech if you really want to git gud\\n- The raids and dungeons oh my god, they\\'re so awesome. Almost worth the time to invest into alone\\n- Some of the coolest moments in the history of online gaming have happened in Destiny (just look up the Whisper mission)\\n- The seasonal stories over the past year and current campaign as of writing this (Witch Queen) have great storytelling\\n- Guns. So many guns. Almost a gun for every situation. Most of us in the community have actual real nostalgia for the muscle memory of some of our guns that we can\\'t use anymore. \\n- Tons of content to check out for a new player\\n- Regular weekly updates from the dev team on Thursdays (TWAB = This Week At Bungie)\\n- On top of that, the dev team is pretty active on Twitter when the more unhinged members of the player base aren\\'t sending them death threats\\n- The soundtrack is incredible\\n- This is gonna sound like a meme but for real, the enemy AI in this game is pretty incredible. It can bug out sometimes of course but especially in harder content, different enemy types approach you different ways based on the weapons you use or the places you stand.\\n- If you like the Diablo experience of just mowing down packs of enemies, D2 can fill that spot in your heart\\n\\nNow for the cons:\\n\\n- We\\'re all addicted. You\\'ll see this whole \"lol 5k hours I don\\'t recommend but I\\'ll log back in tomorrow\" jokes and honestly, there\\'s some truth to that. It\\'s a grindy MMO game. Some elements of it are designed to keep you playing.\\n- All the classics are here: weekly drip-feeding of new content, bad communication on certain long-standing issues in the game for months and even years at a time, and a general level of jank and bugginess to the game that doesn\\'t really ever go away.\\n- Certain parts of the game are massively undeveloped, but forced into the same grinds every season. Crucible, the main PVP mode in this game, only just got it\\'s first new map this season (4 weeks ago at the time of writing) in over 3 years.\\n- Gambit, another main playlist, has been reworked like 4 times(?) since it came out and has somehow gotten worse each time. Also hasn\\'t had a new map since it came out, and has in fact actually lost content since it\\'s release.\\n- The whole game runs on peer to peer servers. This isn\\'t super noticeable for the majority of content in the game, as most of the content in Destiny 2 is team based PvE content or story missions etc, but this makes the PvP just generally unplayable to a lot of people who try it. Crucible can be very fun but there\\'s always a layer of \"oh wow I just headshot that guy with my reticle at least half of my screen away from him\"\\n- The cosmetic shop in Destiny 2, the eververse, is not one of the worst systems I\\'ve ever seen but it\\'s not super great either. It\\'s a pretty classic case of all of the best looking armor sets in the game, and virtually ALL weapon ornaments (weapon cosmetics in regular terms) being locked behind either a real money purchase or PRAYING it goes on sale for a currency you can earn weekly in game. Some cosmetics in the eververse haven\\'t been available for bright dust in years.\\n- Sunsetting, a big process that happened about 2 years ago, removed a ton of content from the game that most of us paid real money for. Entire expansion areas, weapons, quests, etc. were \"vaulted\"\\n- Bungie has a history of taking a really long time to fix more wide, sweeping issues with the game\\n- Bungie\\'s current season system has a few good elements to it, but overall the way they\\'ve designed seasons has become pretty stale over the past 2 years or so\\n- Bugs, man. Destiny 2 is always a buggy game, more than most in my experience. Most of us learn to live with the general jank, but it can be really frustrating sometimes. This season (Season of the Haunted) has been even worse than usual.\\n- The main 3 playlists, Vanguard Ops (short PvE missions such as strikes and battlegrounds), Crucible, and Gambit, are roughly 40% or maybe more of your playtime each season, yet they haven\\'t updated them in any meaningful way in at least 3 years. \\n- The pricing of this game. Realistically, D2 should\\'ve never been pushed as a free to play game. If you wanna access, and I\\'m not exaggerating, 95% of this game, you have to buy the expansions anyway. There\\'s no \"previous expansions\" bundle at a reduced price, and nowadays there\\'s even stuff like the 30th anniversary pack that gives you a dungeon and a rocket launcher for 30 bucks. It\\'s hard to get new players into this game when you have to open with \"well I know it says free to play but if you wanna realistically do the endgame content in this game (Trials/GM Nightfalls) you\\'ll have to spend like 200 dollars for all the expansions\"\\n- The UI is kinda slow and bad. There\\'s a decent amount of item bloat so if you\\'re like me and hate having like 10 new flashing items in your inventory, you\\'re gonna spend a lot of time holding your F key to dismantle things\\n\\nDestiny 2 is a game that is super great at it\\'s core, but tends to shoot itself in the foot a lot of the time. It\\'s a conflicted game, with most of the dev time in seasonal content seemingly going towards releasing new things and rarely improving the content we spend the majority of our time grinding. It\\'s also a game that\\'s going through a big transition period right now. Currently Bungie has made it pretty clear that they\\'re developing D2 for the long term right now, so some things are just being pushed to the side for the overall health of the future of the game. I don\\'t know how much I believe that, but if you\\'re reading this and you know what I mean when I say Path of Exile 2, I salute you. \\n\\nOne thing I haven\\'t really mentioned so far is that realistically, the best content in this game really requires a group of friends to enjoy at it\\'s fullest. I\\'ve been lucky enough to make some real long-term friends in my clan, and legitimately spend a lot of my time teaching new players how to do raids/dungeons/GMs. If you\\'re a solo player, many activities are either straight up impossble (raids) or they require significant time investment to complete solo (dungeons, GM nightfalls, etc). It\\'s a game all about building your vault of items so you have something for every situation. New weapon roll for this build, crazy armor roll with great stats, etc. This can take a long time and kind of creates this weird situation for newer players where they can just go months without getting a certain exotic weapon they need. \\n\\nTo cut things short, I love this game and have obviously spent a lot of time with it. I can\\'t currently recommend it to newer players unfortunately. If you\\'re returning, maybe. The Witch Queen campaign on Legendary difficulty is some of the most fun I\\'ve had with my friends in this game in years, and the seasonal stories really do get better and better. If you have friends and the disposable income, give the game a shot. If you want the game to respect your time, look elsewhere.',\n",

       "  'review': \"So I've been playing this game for 1300+ Hours so far on bnet, now moving onto steam for a lot more.\\nGonna share my story about the great community, but if you're wondering if you should get the game, just go for it, it's absolutely worth your time.\\n\\nAnyways.\\n\\nThrough this game, I've had so many empty hours filled with entertainment, excitement, and sometimes frustration (that's mostly PvP. lookin at you One Eyed Mask)\\n\\nBut the thing I like most about this game, and what has left an impression on me, is the community. The dev team and the players make up the best gaming community I've been a part of.\\n\\nBungie is the most transparent, bold, and dedicated development team I've seen in a long time. They don't do everything perfectly, of course, but they own up to mistakes, they address player feedback and adjust the game accordingly. Just watch their Shadowkeep ViDocs, it's so down to earth, and their actions have proved it's not an act. They feel like distant friends more than developers, and you can tell they truly care about everyone involved in making/playing this game.\\n\\nNow as for me,\\n\\nI started as a solo player with nobody to try this new game out with (I Started in vanilla)\\nAfter I LFG'd and learned my first raid, I joined a clan and made some great friends who I had an absolute blast with. Then I realized raids were such a good time, I wanted to share that experience with people who might not have a group to do it with, so I became a raid sherpa/guide.\\n\\nAfter many runs, lots of Leviathan, mainly, I realized I had a knack for teaching these, and wanted to grow a community from it.\\n\\nNow, since starting my own clan and adding 40+ people, I have made so many new friends and had so many hours of fun with strangers coming together to play my favorite game ever.  I'm someone prone to feeling lonely, and seeing people I brought together have fun chatting and becoming friends makes me feel like I belong.\\n\\nThrough this extremely well-crafted game, I've been able to build a community of players where we all feel like part of a space magic family. If any of my clan members read this sappy post, thanks for being there. You're the best.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"While this is marked as recommended, this rating has some pretty deep explanation below. TL:DR at the bottom.\\n\\nThis is a review by a guy who has a total of almost 2,900 hours at the time of writing, cumulative from BattleNet and Steam eras. Would have definitely been a lot more if I wasn't stuck on console for several months and wasn't in school or work when (and after) Steam support was enabled.\\n\\nI love this game. The universe, the lore, in particular. I have the Chronicler title for a reason, and if I didn't love the game world, I wouldn't have spent even 1000 hours on it. Probably not even 500.\\n\\nThe gameplay and current meta as-is are rapidly degrading. Does it have fun areas? Sure. Is it good fun for new players? Probably. Is it good for players that have been playing the Destiny series since vanilla Destiny 1? Most current sources say no. So, I'll give my opinions below for someone just downloading, or someone purchasing the game's expansions.\\n\\nThe free base game lacks the activities of the current seasonal structure but still has public seasonal events (such as the current guardian games). Is it fun? For a bit. The free campaign is a bit grindy at certain parts and doesn't have the best loot drops, but I'd likely still have fun with it if I hadn't played it before.\\nThere are no REAL re-play-ability features in any of the campaigns, apart from strikes and crucible, but the former gets tiring quickly and the latter loses its spark from time to time. I don't remember if gambit is still free for everyone, but it's in the same murky water.\\n\\nThe paid expansions are interesting, kinda fun solo (for the most part) and definitely fun in a group. If you plan to get any, make sure you get Forsaken and/or Shadowkeep (the 'upgrade edition' is 50 bucks, cheaper than getting both individually). I enjoyed both, and they were fun for a while. Emphasis on a while. I'll get to that later.\\nKeep in mind that the other campaigns (red war, warmind, and curse of osiris) come first in the timeline.\\n\\nThe other main paid feature (currently) are the Seasons. Each season comes with a different suite of content that will (currently) be phased out at the end of the season to make room for new content. This INCLUDES all matchmaking activities and triumphs attached to that particular season, as well as the seasonal badges. \\nSundial is a perfect example of this. If you don't know what I'm talking about, google it. It comes from the most recent lapsed season.\\nThe current season is very, VERY bland and tedious. It revolves almost ENTIRELY around Bounty completions, small tasks that have no real impact on gameplay other than to mix up what you need to do with your arsenal to complete their contents. The grind takes an age if you don't have days straight to play, and ends up with very little satisfaction because of how little content there is.\\nThis is only a real issue if you've been playing the game fairly regularly. If you're new to the game and/or universe, this issue will be far less apparent, and may not even show up until the next season due to the plethora of content available for a fresh character to complete. Unfortunately, however, this content drought cycle has become a VERY strong pattern. Luckily one that does not make me pay much for it, but one that still hurts all the same.\\n\\nSeasons are purchasable via a 'season pass' or individually. I'm not sure if costs are the same either way, the option disappears after purchase of the current pass.\\nContents include the seasonal content alongside something similar to the season passes in Fortnight, Division 2, COD, etc. without being the useless cash grabs that those ones are. I actually like the system of the reward track accompanying new content rather than it being separate from that release's dlc. \\nAre there items that encourage play? Yes. Is there a way to buy levels in the pass? Yes, but the items within the pass do not a strong character make, and purchasing levels is FULLY LOCKED until the season is almost over, rendering the possibility of pay-to-win being almost impossible. \\nGranted, f2p content does not have a large pool of excellent weaponry, but that's been a fact since before the game went free-to play, and I don't think the difference in loot pools is nearly as significant as some people would claim. Especially with the new armor system.\\n\\nThere's also loot boxes, but you can earn (most of) the items in the Eververse through gameplay and bright dust bounties. Does this mean I'm advocating the required completion of bounties for most cosmetics? Hell no. I'm borderline pissed that there STILL aren't any cosmetics attainable through normal gameplay and activity completion apart from the prestige Leviathan ornaments.\\n\\nNow, would I recommend this game? This is very complicated, as you can probably tell from the above.\\n\\nFor a new player with low dedication / time allocation to the universe of the game? Yes!\\nThere's a plethora of content to enjoy out of the box, and the fact that it's only 60 bucks for '3 years' of content is quite the steal.\\n\\nTo a new or returning player familiar with the lore, universe and with a lot of time on their hands to complete everything the game throws at us? Probably not. It really depends:\\n- If you haven't played D2 yet, you might get a good couple hundred hours of play time out of the box between grinding out the campaigns and hitting endgame 'earlier than intended'. For those of you, the 60 bucks might be worth it.\\n- For people who played vanilla and/or forsaken and/or shadowkeep? I assume you know most of the problems I mentioned above, and know to wait and see what they plan to change with their content-cycling system before you come back. I definitely wouldn't recommend a return at this point unless you want to get some friends into the game, or want to grind out the seasonal activities to see where the story is leading.\\n\\nTL:DR; I recommend this game with a few heavy warnings:\\n\\n1- If you plan on playing this game for an extended period of time, expect heavy content drought between season releases.\\n2- If you are returning to the game, I would suggest waiting or doing research on how Bungie is changing content-cycle systems.\\n3- If you've purchased or completed shadowkeep and/or forsaken and plan on getting the seasons, do NOT EXPECT THE SEASONS TO REFLECT THIS AMOUNT OF CONTENT. Seasonal content is often particularly gimmicky. Particularly, overuse of bounty mechanics is a huge let down.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Fun shooter especially with friends, but the developers clearly do not understand how to get new players to stay. \\nThere are so many paywalls and the story is really hard to make sense of since you're thrown around to completely different campaigns randomly when starting the game. A lot of the story is hidden behind season (passes) so you also miss extra information that is quite relevant to the story, so next update comes and you're left wondering what the heck is going on. You can't just proceed through the timeline as it is and instead get spoilers about the story in every possible way. \\n\\nHow about an option to force the game to follow the main storyline in order?\\n\\nThey release new content and then they make old content useless. My inventory is filled with items that say they're completely safe to delete, so all that hard work to gather them is rendered useless. They don't want you to progress too fast.\\n\\nNever buy the DLC for full price. It's just not worth it. This has been an issue since Destiny 1. They originally cut off a lot of main story content and sold it off in DLC's. Actually, long before the DLC's were made available people were able to glitch into the DLC areas that were fully available in the base game, but were activated when you bought DLC. They then released Taken King and forced you to buy the whole game + DLC's again for full game price rather than allowing old players to buy just the DLC for cheaper. They then released the game currency and now you can spend at least 20€ to buy single armor skins or even more to unlock seasonal content during the year.\\n\\nTo fully enjoy the game you'll have to be prepared to spend hundreds on this game each year.\\nActivision was bad, but it feels like Bungie wants to be worse with their monetization.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I HAVE SPENT(or wasted): 1000 HRS OF MY LIFE ON THIS GAME (Which is nothing compared to some of you, but I like the number 1000)\\n\\nAnd therefore, I now feel like an entitled idiot who will now give you a review. Because after spending 1000 hrs of my oxygen and brain-cell power on this game, I feel like I know just little bit about it. A little bit. So without any more stupid rambling, here's my poorly constructed, naive, and somewhat botched review of Destiny 2...*clears throat*\\n\\nI joined the ranks of the Vanguard when D2 was on the ol' Battlenet, back when Activision still had its mits on Bugie's precious player base. And since its migration to the new platform here at Steam, there have indeed been some changes in latency, player-base, and server issues. Which to be honest, I think we all expected right from the word go.\\n\\nIf you are starting D2 as a new light with no background knowledge, it is important to remember that progressing through every task given to you is going to get you that light-level advantage when leveling up your guarding for the first time. This is where the first hiccup comes in.. Since we had the big Shadowkeep update, trying to figure out where to go next in your quests can be a small nightmare. \\nI spent an entire night with one of my clan's blueberries trying to help her figure out where to go before we succumbed to Googling the directions like tourists in a foreign city. If Bungie could potentially alter the quest tracking to perhaps make the major quests more linear in their pursuit, it'd be a whole lot easier for people coming in with no prior knowledge to the games mechanics.\\nThat said, If you need to go in blind, always check your destinations tab and hover over each planet where the flashing symbol is relevant to your quest. Each major DLC will have a symbol that you can follow through the Solar System.\\nTo get to the major stories: Amanda Holiday herself is where you will find the major story line journeys as you begin your career as a magnificent Space Moron.\\n\\nDestiny 2 I think appeals to people who have a good eye for lore and rich environments. The first thing that overwhelmed me was how detailed some of the biomes were. Especially the Dreaming City, which I think we can all agree is one heck of a place! It's pretty important to take note of those small details that Bungie has put in, down to reading the lore books that are there too. One aspect however that the current player base rolls their eyes at is the bounty system: Bounties are the backbone of the seasonal progress. And while I get that Bungo has tried to centre its play style around bounty completions, which can get repetitive, you do have to engage with this mechanic to build your light level.\\n\\nWhat D2 additionally excels at is creating a place where you can progress at your own speed, or have your fireteam/clan help you through certain areas that you need help with. The Clan system offered by D2 is a standout in that it allows you to connect your skills with that of others to accomplish tasks that are integral to the game. There is some content that does very much need a fireteam to be completed. But if you're a magical rootin' tootin' alien shootin' god of computers games, then running solo can always give you big results too. \\nThe main consensus is however that joining a clan is is your best interest. And that is because the gain you can receive in loot and bounty-clocking is a lot better when you have other Space Morons with you terrorising the universe.\\n\\n  Which brings me to the PVP element. *Deep sigh*\\n\\nAs a PVE enthusiast, I thought I'd never really delve into the PVP elements solely because my level of skill is appalling. I know Shaxx is very encouraging everytime I go to see him, but I'm 99.9% sure he's just being nice to poor little Miss D, who repeatedly falls of the map while she is scoped in.\\nWith how many people do have accounts solely for the purpose of playing Crucible Competitive and Trials of Osiris, you are going to find some of your matches are going to be simply dying repeatedly to laggy space-apes who are not going to change from using their shotguns. The toxicity level of these groups (which can sometimes be entire clans of elitist PVP lunatics) you really have to ignore if you want to try and push your way through the ranks. \\nHowever if you have a supportive clan (like mine) you'll find after a few rounds and finding your optimal loadout, you will enjoy it! \\nFollowing the meta on weapon types can help you get your feet in a match, but be aware you will not be liked for it! \\n\\nFinally we have the guardian classes themselves. \\nI feel this is absolutely worth talking about, and when you look at the pop culture around each class, you can't help but be entertained by it all. \\nWhat you play effects very much your play style: Hunters are often high speed, high damage dealing plucky little acrobats with big mouths. Warlocks are the bookworms with a ego who think they are the only reason the team didn't wipe on the boss. And Titans... well. We just like Titans because they are easy to pick and often have Crayola dust left on their helmets after too many snacks.\\nJokes aside, a well constructed fireteam/raid team/6 stack will have at least one of each class. This generally distributes the skill pattern quite well, and some of the most stress-free raids I've ever run have had a good balance of all 3.\\nAgain. However:\\nIf you want to run yourself through most of this game for the challenge, Titans do possess the skill trees that can more effectively push you through the more difficult situations you may find yourself in. Yes, we pick on them relentlessly, but they do play a big role in Destiny, and will continue to be fantastic Space Apes into the future of D2.\\n\\nWell. I've finished dinner and written 6 or so paragraphs, so I suppose this is where you end a review? I have no idea. As mentioned afore, I have the writing competency of a scientific calculator if you had taped fake nails on it and asked it to do a bachelor of journalism. \\nAll-in-all, I have immensely enjoyed this game, and will continue to. Yes this game has some serious bugs, but it is still lovable in its own buggy way. Have a go. Watch some guides. Get a good clan (come join ours it's the best). Go give the Darkness the stiff upper lip and have a gaff with Zavala. \\n10/10 for Creativity and Originality.\\n7/10 for Space Magic. \\n1/10 for Chonky Crayons.\\n8/10 for Gameplay.\\n11/10 for Good TImes!\\n\\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk. No refunds on brain cells lost from reading all of this garbage. \\nSalut!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b] TLDR: Silence Bungo, I do not wish to grind for rolls anymore, I wish to be happy... [/b]\\n\\n[h1] The New player experience [/h1]\\nIt\\'s 2022. You decide to check out this hot and cool shooter called Destiny 2. You log in, make a character, and watch the intro. It\\'s short, mysterious and the music swells as the title is revealed and you\\'re instantly immersed in the world. You then proceed to shoot and disintegrate some aliens throughout the intro missions and perhaps think to yourself: \"Wow! I get to wield space magic and use a multitude of guns, this gameplay is awesome. I can\\'t wait to play the rest of the game!\". As you put in some hours though, eventually, inevitably, it hits you: \"Wait, what am I supposed to do again? Whats the story? Who are these people? Is there a campaign I can play? Hold on what do you mean that intro was actually from Destiny 1? Where can I talk to other players? Should I buy an expansion? Which one should I get? Do I need a season pass? [strike] What the fuck is a zorpalod [/strike] .\" In short, its a bit of a mess for newcomers. For all its focus on an ongoing story and \\'living world\\' through yearly expansions and seasonal content, the very nature of seasonal story telling (which are usually ~ 10 weeks) means you\\'ll miss out on them if you were not playing then. Coupled with the content vault, where Bungie shelved/removed/deleted/dragged-out-behind-the-shed-and-shot roughly half the game around Beyond Light (2020) and will most likely continue to do so for older expansions (for the sake of game stability), means that it is difficult for new players to orient themselves in the game\\'s world if they don\\'t even have the opportunity revisit older content.\\n\\n[h1] The Shootin\\' [/h1]\\nAdmittedly, the game plays fantastically. No other game I\\'ve tried nails the feeling of popping some space demon\\'s head with an over-sized handgun and incinerating his pals with lightning like Destiny, and to add the ability of experiencing it with friends no less. Moment to moment gameplay is awesome, and encounter design for more higher level content is usually pretty well thought out, and its the reason why most people stick with the game even if they might complain about it in the same sentence. Most importantly, Bungie knows this. They know they have lighting in a bottle, and over the years it has been proven that however much the very vocal Destiny community likes complain of things, they will still continue to put in hundreds upon hundreds of hours. If you understand that, then you\\'ll understand why the game is monetized and priced the way it is. \\n\\n[h1] The Price [/h1]\\nDon\\'t be fooled, its really a \"free to try\" sort of situation. With season passes lasting around 3 months and the big dramatic expansions coming yearly, you\\'re expected to pay somewhere upwards of £80 pounds a year if you intend to keep playing and having things to do. Video games are an extremely cost-efficient medium and there are so many interesting games out there to buy for a fraction of the cost, giving you more value and enjoyment for the money you spend. Though what\\'s provided by the seasons and expansions is often well made and interesting, it is hard for me justify their full price tag under any circumstances. Coupled with this is also the enormous amount of microtransactions present in the game, from skins to emote to ships and anything of the like. Look I get it, its a long lost battle against microtransactions in video games, but if an in-game emote costs roughly as much as an season pass and the rewards and activities (repetitive as they may be) associated with it, I can\\'t help but feel a little ripped-off. At least a couple years ago one could say hey, at least a couple campaigns are free and playable, but those are long gone. Essentially, it feels like a subscription service and you should know what you\\'re getting into. \\n\\n[h1] The Loop [/h1]\\nAs is par for the course of the genre, the game eventually devolves into several repetitive gameplay loops in certain activities if you\\'re trying to achieve some specific goal/item. There is a lot of things to do in the game don\\'t get me wrong, but inevitably one may find themselves grinding for some particular goal, be it a good roll on a gun or whatever and just spend hours on it. In this case, Bungie is very good at making \\'boxes\\' for the player to tick, and playing Destiny 2 sometimes makes me feel like I\\'m some hamster in a wheel thinking he\\'s progressing somewhere, while simultaneously being afraid of missing out on timed content. It is what it is, and I suppose there is nothing wrong in finding enjoyment in that, but it is important to hold no illusions over what ~80% of the game actually is. \\n\\n[h1] The Closing Thoughts[/h1]\\nAbout the main reason I would recommend Destiny 2 to completely fresh players is the no cost of entry and its amazing gameplay. Try it out, the look and feel of the game is brilliant, and as long you are aware of what you are getting yourself into, you might even like it. But the price and nature of drip-fed content along with peculiarities too numerous to fit in this review such as the reliance on third-party apps/websites for basic functionalities like loadouts or LFG\\'s leaves a lot to be desired. It does not help the fact that money spent on the game\\'s expansions just feels wrong considering the inevitable removal of said expansions down the road. As I\\'ve mentioned before, most continue to play because they\\'re just not much that compares to the way Destiny handles. \\nIf you are a returning player however, I would definitely recommend checking the game out again. It\\'s in a fairly alright state at the moment, while some controversial mechanics like sunsetting are gone (though what has been sunset will remain that way), and you are probably used to some of Bungo\\'s hijinks by now.',\n",

       "  'review': \"TL:DR - Satisfying guns, good campaigns and TONS of content make for a very good FPS-RPG game!\\n\\nDestiny 2 has some of the best FPS gunplay on the market today, especially if you enjoy playing with friends. If that's all you care about then you might want to give the game a try. D2 has just recently begun transitioning to a more RPG-focused style of play so some things such as mods, perks and skill trees aren't fully fleshed out yet. That said you probably won't notice this unless you're in the end-game trying to min-max your build.\\n\\nThe early game can be a little challenging for new players because of all the various systems at play. Think of it as an easier Warframe or Path of Exile. There are plenty of resources to find out more about the game however, particularly on Reddit. /r/ShardItKeepIt for deciding which weapons to keep or discard. /r/CruciblePlaybook for PvP tips. /r/DestinyTheGame as the official unofficial subreddit for the game, and /r/Destiny2 for the memes. You can also look to /r/Fireteams or the Destiny mobile app to find people to play with.\\n\\nIn terms of free content, the first three campaigns are unlocked - [i] The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind. [/i] You also have access to all strikes (replayable mini-missions), PvP and PvEvP maps and modes, and all 9 planets/destinations. Additionally there are three raids available - [i] Leviathan, Spire of Stars, and Eater of Worlds. [/i] These are challenging but fun 6-man activities that require a lot of coordination and skill to beat. There's a lot more F2P activities as well that you will find once you start playing. They may not have all been amazing at launch, but after 1-2 years of updates and tuning they've never been more enjoyable.\\n\\n[i] Forsaken [/i] is the first paid DLC. Purchase of it comes with the raids [i] Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow, [/i] as well as several exotic weapons. Even if you don't or won't raid, it's worth it for the story alone. It's a sci-fi western tale of revenge for a dear friend, and is Destiny's highest narrative moment. \\n\\n[i] Shadowkeep [/i] is the second and newest paid DLC. While not as impressive as [i] Forsaken [/i] story-wise, there's still a lot of content to do especially considering how it's bundled with the current Season Pass. This is the story of how another ancient threat is discovered under the Moon. Sounds underwhelming yes, but saying anymore would require spoilers. The current Season focuses on an army of machines controlled by sentient milk that invades the solar system. Absolutely worth it. There's also a raid included here, [i] Garden of Salvation, [/i] as well as an upcoming dungeon.\\n\\nAll in all, there's an overwhelming amount of content here if you're a new player. It may be daunting, but play through the (optional but highly recommended) campaigns and you'll soon find yourself at home with the game. \\n\\n\\nEdit - Just adding that I've put 800+ hours into the game before it transferred to Steam. One of my favorite games of all time.\",\n",

This is definitely a game where you should look up a quick beginner's guide as a newbie to point you in the right directions.\\n- No ingame guildfinder, you have to do that on bungie's website for some reason\\n- Hard to keep track of quests; you should be able to pin more than 4 quests at a time, the menu is disorganized and quests can get lost, and a lot of quests will leave you scratching your head until you just have to google how to complete it\\n- A few instances of missions bugging out forcing you to restart \\n- Waypoints could be better and less finicky \\n- Menus are not good in general\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nIf you like the idea of exploring, particularly in a space and science fiction setting, you might really enjoy this game. If you like shooting a bunch of things and chasing after loot, you will like this game. It can/does become a massive time sink however, which might be a good or bad thing depending on the player. \\nIf you are even considering playing this game, you should just give it a try because its free to play and you have nothing to lose.

       "  'review': 'Edit: I have seen the developer update about the state of Destiny from Joe Blackburn. When the changes and future plans leading up to the next DLC take effect, I will be updating this review.\\n\\nEdit 2: Last played on June 26, 2021. I have since uninstalled the game with no plans of returning anytime soon. Anyone who gets triggered by my review, it\\'s at your own expense. Happy reading.\\n\\nTL;DR: largely NOT free-to-play, core content removal, planned obsolescence, lack of play-testing and playerbase neglect, has left a large amount of current players feeling disrespected and disinterested.\\n\\nAs much as I love playing this game, to eager, new players thinking about getting into it: DON\\'T. With the developer\\'s design decisions removing a large amount of the game\\'s content, putting it into a \"content vault\" for use in the future, in the game\\'s current state, that \"free to play\" button on the store page is a lie. A majority of the game is currently locked behind a paywall, with many core activities only accessible if players buy the DLCs. There is no reduction in price for the DLCs from Bungie\\'s side for this lack of content, so, buyers beware. You will be paying full price for DLCs that had about 80% of its content left unplayable or removed.\\n\\nLast year, Bungie implemented \"sunsetting\" gear, a.k.a. the concept of planned obsolescence in the game. It is already in effect. 2 out of the 3 latest DLCs have [expired] gear that is unusable in the current season. This gear will be updated to have a new expiration date next season, however, the [expired] gear that players collect now, will not have their expiration date(s) updated. Players who invested time into obtaining gear that they want from the activities in the 2 earlier DLCs, have to grind for it all over again. No reduction of material costs to upgrade gear have been taken into account for the introduction of sunsetting, removing any incentive to continue the grind. Destiny 2 content creators on YouTube have also eaten their words. After initially supporting the idea of sunsetting to reduce powercreep, a majority of them now agree that it is bad for the game.\\n\\nWith the new DLC, Beyond Light, the developers introduced a new playable subclass, Stasis. Basically magic space ice wizardry. In the game\\'s PvP modes, these new subclasses are absolutely over-tuned. From a FPS player\\'s perspective, Stasis has disrupted the core of FPS gameplay, by literally allowing players to be frozen where they stand, allowing for easy frags. Slowing, as a game mechanic, also causes players to not have their shots registered to hit their target, even when they have their sights directly on them. It was obvious that they released the new subclasses without play-testing, to trap new players into buying Beyond Light. Also, they removed several PvP maps, with no new modes, entirely neglecting their PvP playerbase. How about that, a regression of content, in a live-service game.\\n\\nI will continue to see this game through. But if the above sounds like good decisions made by developers who respect your time invested into their game and know what you want as a player, and not a game in its death throes, I envy your blissful ignorance.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll give you a little background on me as a FPS player before getting into this review. If you look at my most-played games, Borderlands 2 & 2.5 top the list, followed by MachineGames\\' first Wolfenstein games, then the Deus Ex reboot and Half-Life 2 sitting pretty at 200+ hours. DOOM 2016 is way up there as well as the original Rage. Honorable mention for Starbreeze/Vin Diesel\\'s \"Riddick\" games. Good stuff! Anyway, you get the idea. I like shiny shooty looty (mostly) story-driven single-player sci-fi games a whole lot.\\n\\nI am not a fan of multiplayer games, though. The last multiplayer arena shooter I played and actually enjoyed was one of the really old Unreal Tournaments. Let\\'s just say I was a bit wary about getting into this. I was peripherally aware of the drama surrounding the original Destiny, and I\\'ve never played a Bungie game before, so I was all set to ignore this until a friend peer-pressured me into checking it out. :P (And I owe him a beer or two for doing so!)\\n\\nSo if you\\'re like me, going into Destiny 2 blind, here\\'s the skinny: You are a post-human gun-toting space wizard and the Sol system is under attack by unpleasant dudes from another galaxy. Or maybe this galaxy. Doesn\\'t matter. There\\'s a lot of them and they\\'re ugly and you need to kill them or they\\'ll eat you and/or sign you up for outrageous student loans or something. The motives are always pretty clear for D2\\'s interplanetary Rambo pub crawl. In other words: yes, Private Hudson, it [i]is[/i] another bug hunt.\\n\\nLeveling in D2 is borrowed from, among others, Vermintide 2\\'s equipment-level system (i.e. your character gains levels by how powerful your gear is), and the equipment is doled out in drops from your kills and quest rewards, very much like Borderlands\\' loot-and-shoot mechanic. Lots of comparing rifles, helmets, boots, cheese, rocket launchers, cats, pianos, laundry hampers, etc.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got the skills to pay the bills, though, by which I mean D2\\'s class and skill system makes me unreasonably happy. You have 3 character slots, 3 races, and 3 main classes. Each of the 3 main classes have 3 elemental subclasses that you can switch to at any time, and each subclass can tweak their individual skills nearly on the fly. In one of my favorite MMOs from way back when, you could slot in certain skills from any of the classes in the game, on top of your main class/job, and the amount of gameplay customization this provides is significant. You get to tweak the skills of your chosen subclass even further with either the Forsaken or Shadowkeep expansion. (The consensus seems to be that Forsaken is the better value, FYI.)\\n\\nCharacter customization (face, hair, etc) is a bit bare, but it\\'s not a big deal as there is a massive amount of gear customization. Dye your sword (yes, there are 3rd-person swords) pink, paint your helmet black or green or whatever the hell you want with semi-rare drops called \"shaders\"; more infrequent drops include specific skins for specific gear, which you can also dye some insane color. Once you acquire a certain shader or skin, and you use it up on a trash piece of gear... you don\\'t have to hope for another random drop of the vanity item. Your pickups are all stored in a \"collections\" tab, where you can just grab them again for varying amounts of in-game (not cashy money) currency. Score!\\n\\nIt\\'s a system that reminds me of Assassin\\'s Creed: Odyssey\\'s persistent weapon/armor skins (whatever gear you picked up, its skin was saved to your character so you could always switch them in and out as per your fancy). Small thing, but showing consideration to the player and their time is sadly not something you always find in AAA games.\\n\\nD2 is huge. It takes place across the solar system that we all know and love, no matter how many planets you think are worthy enough of being called planets. This seems like a minor point, but getting to bounce around a bunch of worlds that you probably know the names of by heart, and seeing such stunning representations of the beauty of our sister planets... it all creates a deeply satisfying and familiar hook so you\\'re not bored to tears by your 50th visit to planet Flibbertygibbet. And it also helps that Bungie hires writers and scriptwriters who clearly know what the hell they\\'re doing, because for once, for ONCE, I\\'m not always skipping cutscenes or dialogue -- most of the quests feature a lot of good voicework and the script is quite funny a lot of the time.\\n\\nThat may or may not be due to the fact that there are [url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6721356/fullcredits]a lot of famous people providing voiceovers[/url] in D2. Your mileage may vary, of course, but this is a game with massive production values and it shows.\\n\\nWhat else... gunplay is freaking fantastic. I haven\\'t enjoyed visceral shooting like this since Wolfenstein or DOOM 2016. That\\'s the other thing that I\\'m constantly surprised by, that this is a really great shooter all by itself. In the open-world maps your player transitions seamlessly from open-world to instanced sections of the maps, meaning that once you enter a named cave or a ruin or whatever, no one else can come in with you other than your party, so if you really hate playing in a massively online blah-blah, you have plenty of options. Aside from raids and the like, it\\'s a very solo-friendly game as far as I can tell. D2 may borrow from the loot-and-shoot school of gaming but they took the time to build an astounding selection of guns, many of which feel and sound unique enough at lower tiers to give you a lot of versatility when you\\'re still starting out.\\n\\nAnd to top it off, the game community is really quite pleasant! Your mileage may vary, again, but there\\'s some obvious love for this game in the playerbase which comes out often in random interactions.\\n\\nIn summary: if you\\'re looking for a new addiction, and you like a little gun with your space opera, get stuck in. You may regret it if you have one of those \"social lives\" that people keep whispering about! Worth a try if you don\\'t. :P',\n",

       "  'review': 'You start playing destiny 2 . Eventually you will come across a weapon/armor piece that you really want to use in your builds. You start your grind for that gear . After hours & hours of grinding , it still doesn\\'t drop. At this point you become furious , even over the smallest of things . You start hating everything about the game & start criticising developers for every decision they have made. You think of how bad & unbalanced pvp is & especially with stasis , how the endgame is literally a grindfest , how the drop rates for many weapons is so low, how you get error coded for no resason , how the implementation of so many things (like recent transmog system in S14) is bad & how every step the dev\\'s take in the game makes it more worse , you start noticing how dev\\'s are paywalling most of the things . At this point you feel like every hour you invested in this game was a waste and that the dev\\'s dont respect your time at all . But remember while you are thinking of all these things , you are still grinding for that gear , you are still doing that activity . You dont want to stop grinding , At that point you say to yourself , I will invest another few hours and get that gear than stop now & waste all the hours that I invested today.  \\n  \\n You invest another couple of hours in grinding & at the end of the day ( or tomorrow, cause u wont stop, lol ) , you finally get that gear . Now you feel satisfied . You open your character menu and check that weapon . You are completely stunned/surprised . The weapon that you just got has absolute god tier perks in every column ( we call them god rolls in destiny ) . Its the weapon roll that your friends were chasing and still haven\\'t got . There\\'s a guy out there who invested 100+ hours in trials , has 50 flawless & still doesn\\'t have god roll igneous but you get it first try on ten losses by jumping off the map. Now you are completely happy & immensely satisfied. You never felt this kind of happiness even when you graduated . You know that if u show it to your friends , they r really gonna get jealous & that\\'s why you really want to show them . You get a raid exotic first try & your fireteam leader kicks you because of that , cause he still hasnt gotten it in 150 clears . But him kicking you in this case actually makes you more happy cause you know he is jealous of you. \\n\\n Now that you have got the god roll , the next phase starts . You think of all the positive things about the game , how it has so many activites that you can play endlessly with your friends and never get bored , how the game\\'s replayability factor is good , even though the endgame is grindfest , you still feel like doing it & never get bored of it, how the dev\\'s always keep saying \" we are listening \" & keep fixing stuff/try their best. How you can exploit bugs/cheeses in this game without getting banned cause bungie themselves said its their fault if such bugs exist, how the community (inspite of being toxic many times) comes together to donate & help whenever a charity is conducted . Now that you are happy you start playing the game with a positive vibe until you set your eyes on another weapon . \\n\\n The whole game is just you shifting your thoughts from positive to negative & vice versa from time to time , contradicting yourself & your own thoughts , but you will still keep playing & playing  & playing . You will eventually reach a point where you will have evrytg , & you dont feel like you need any new things anymore, but you will still keep playing. You wont know why you are playing the game anymore but you will still keep playing. You will get up at 3 AM in the midnight half asleep or sleep walking , load up destiny 2 , go to all vendors , collect their bounties and start doing them , all with your eyes closed . How you ask ? cause at  that point you would have already done each of those bounties a thousand times , so you would know subconsciously which bounty it will be from each vendor & even its objectives. \\n\\n I read this in one of the other reviews - \" If you are playing this game only for pvp , then you are being delusional \" , that perfectly sums up the pvp experience . You will feel like pvp is balanced & unbalanced at the same time . Unbalanced? stasis of course . You might have the best aim in the world , sm hunter with with a shuriken will freeze you & knock you out or a titan with his melee will throw you off the map or a warlock with his infinite super glitch will keep killing you until the round/game ends . Bungie did fix the warlock glitch , how? by disabling it of course. Balanced ? again stasis . You will run against a lot of hackers on pc , and stasis is again the countermeasure . The cheater might have infinite health , the titan will throw him off the map with his melee, He might have perfect aim , well he cant shoot if he is frozen , can he?. Pretty ironic that I talked about actual legit players while referencing unbalance & cheaters/hackers while referencing balance . That\\'s the power of stasis.\\n\\n  So to sum it all up , do I recommend this game ?\\n - Well YES , but actually NO.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Despite the troubled past of the series (for which both Bungie and Activision share the blame), the new free-to-play version of Destiny 2 on Steam (also known as Destiny 2: New Light) is one of the best online games you can play in 2019. \\n\\nOther than Forsaken and Shadowkeep, all of the previous expansion content along with all of the maingame content is now completely free. This amounts to a massive volume of places to explore, quests/adventures to do, routine patrols or public events as well as PvE missions/raids and a huge smattering of PvP content too. \\n\\nAnd in general, Destiny 2's world and story, as well as the visual design, graphics and soundtrack are among the best I've ever seen in a game. As far as gameplay goes, the game offers some of the best gunplay, moment-to-moment game loop and mechanics I've ever encountered in a game. \\n\\nDestiny 2 is a must-play and one of the best games to come out of Bungie ever since Halo 2.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]PREFACE:[/h1]\\n\\nI will start this by saying that you might find yourself looking at my \"hours played\" tag and either groan or stare confused. Yes, undoubtedly I play D2 quite a lot. I was going for an inside joke regarding Bungie, the parent company, as they LOVE the number 7; it\\'s one of their [i]leitmotif[/i], you could say. So I wanted to post this review when I hit the 7777h mark.\\n\\nThe latest edit just made the joke null. Oh well...\\n\\n[h1]THE REVIEW:[/h1]\\n\\nOk, now to the review. So I played this game even before it was brought to Steam, back in the days it was on Blizzard\\'s Battle Launcher. I like to think that I\\'m a veteran in terms of the information I have on the game, both lore-wise and mechanics-wise. (Even if I\\'m still sh*t at PvP, but that\\'s between us...). So I will pass onto you some of the main things to know about the game before starting it. And I hope you will enjoy it!\\n\\n[h1]THE GAME ITSELF:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]Plot:[/u]\\n\\nYou died. We don\\'t know how long ago. We don\\'t know in what manner you died. We don\\'t know what your name was, what you did during your life, who your relatives were. But we know that you are dead.\\n\\nYou are then resurrected one day by a small sentient drone-like A.I. entity called a Ghost. There are many Ghosts roaming the lands in search for their Guardian, as it is called. You are one of those. You are a Guardian of Humanity. You can wield various Light powers granted through this Ghost by a mysterious \"moon\", called the Traveler. This moon is floating above Earth, above the Last City. The last place where Humanity still stands.\\n\\nThousands of years in the past, a cataclysm called the Collapse happened in our Solar System, where the human race was driven all the way to the Last City on Earth by the forces of Darkness. Before that time, humanity was an interplanetary species. Colonizing most planets and moons from our System and already sending colony ships in the outer space.\\n\\nYour main goal now is to defeat the enemies in our planetary backyard.\\n\\n[h1]CHARACTER CREATION:[/h1]\\n\\n[u][b]/!\\\\ Warning! /!\\\\[/b][/u] You have to know this before actually creating your character. Its appearance can\\'t be changed after it has been created. You\\'d have to delete that char. completely and that\\'s not something you\\'d probably want to do if you had sunk enough time into that char. over time. (You can always keep your mask on in social spaces if you don\\'t want your face to be seen.)\\n\\nI will provide here the main options you have when choosing your appearance, so that you can make an informed decision on what you\\'re looking for.\\n\\nFirst of all, you can make 3 characters on your account. They can be either one of each class (Titan, Warlock, Hunter) or any combination of those: 2 of a type and 1 of another; or 3 of the same if you want to. But it\\'s not really worth going for anything other than 1 of each.\\n\\nSo you have 3 classes, 3 races and 2 sexes = 18 permutations.\\n\\n[u]The Classes:[/u]\\n\\n          - [b]TITAN[/b]: the \"paladin\" or \"barbarian\" of the game, in D&D terms. Titans are known for their barricades, that absorb incoming damage for a brief time. they are more of a defensive class, but like the other 2, they have offensive capabilities as well.\\n          - [b]WARLOCK[/b]: the \"mage\", \"wizard\" or well... \"warlock\" of the game. Warlocks are the ones that can heal or empower you in various ways. their powers are for both support and a strong offensive.\\n          - [b]HUNTER[/b]: the \"rogue\" type. simple as that. sneaky and deadly*.\\n\\n*depending on who you ask. :P\\n\\n[u]The Races:[/u]\\n\\nNow, the races don\\'t impact your playstyle all that much (just some occasional dialogue changes in certain Story missions). But based on the lore, I will explain the races for you, in case you are interested in going for any in particular.\\n\\n          - [b]HUMAN[/b]: ...ye. I hope I don\\'t need to elaborate.\\n          - [b]EXO[/b]: an Exo is a robot with a human consciousness inside them. it\\'s not an A.I. or Cyborg. they used to be an actual human before they had their mind transferred into an Exo frame so that they can extend their lifespan indefinitely. they behave the same as a normal human. they can eat, even if they don\\'t need to for survival. it\\'s just for them to keep a semblance of normalcy.\\n          - [b]AWOKEN[/b]: like a human, but purple................................ ok ok ok. it\\'s more that just that. the Awoken were created millennia ago, all at once, when a colony ship on it\\'s way out of the Solar System was caught between a major fight between the forces of Darkness and the Light. from that struggle, the humans onboard were sent through a black/worm hole into another pocket dimension called the Distributary. they were all transformed, imbued with both Light and Dark. thousands of years later, part of those Awoken exited their dimension back into ours, either because they were exiled or because they went on scientific expeditions, while the rest stayed in their homeworld.\\n\\n(I can\\'t make the Exos and the Awokens justice with just these short descriptions, so if you ever get interested in knowing more about them, I recommend you read the lore on them, either in game, on a website called Ishtar Collective, or watch some YouTubers like \"My name is Byf\" or \"Myelin Games\" for fun and indepth lore explanations.)\\n\\n[h1]THE SOCIAL ASPECT:[/h1]\\n\\nMost of the game content is better played with others in a team (or a so called, \"fireteam\" ingame), but you can find enjoyment in being a lone wolf too. You can invite people you see roaming around the social spaces or the various destinations as your friends, but usually you are more likely to get accepted by them if you are doing an activity at the time with said people. I encourage you to make friends, because it gives you so many benefits to your game experience in the long run.\\n\\nNow, there are some CONs in relation with this aspect of the game. One of them is that it\\'s usually hard to find through the game people that want to do the same activity as you. Some of them have matchmaking and there\\'s little to no issues in that. Usually these same activities, but on their harder difficulties, don\\'t have any matchmaking, so you need to go in with a team already formed beforehand. That\\'s were LFG sites or Discord servers come in handy. (I recommend discord.gg/D2LFG, I think it\\'s the actual biggest LFG server for D2.)\\n\\n[h1]QUALITY OF LIFE TOOLS:[/h1]\\n\\n- D2 Companion App (official mobile app that can help you keep track of your pursuits and allow you to get bounties from the ingame vendors without going all the way to them to purchase them)\\n\\n- blueberries.gg (this website will explain more aspects of the game to you if you ever have questions, as a new player)\\n\\n- Destiny Item Manager (DIM) (browser app which is your #1 best friend. it\\'s indispensable for a normal D2 experience)\\n\\n- BrayTech (my favorite app of them all. it can be used to keep track of the progress and timer of your bounties and quests you have in the game at the time, see triumphs and their progress as well, plan what challenges you want to complete in game for better loot. and many more features. you can also customize some areas yourself)\\n\\n- light.gg (website which shows you any item in the game and its commonality. it crowd-sources the perk rolls of any weapon based on what the community uses the most - it\\'s decent for showing you the better rolls, but not necessarily in all situations)\\n\\n[h1]PROs:[/h1]\\n\\n- gunplay, abilities and movement are very satisfying\\n- new content coming often\\n- a huge and varied community, where the parent company (Bungie) encourages community creation and interaction\\n- extensive lore\\n- great endgame content for PvE (dungeons, raids)\\n- TELESTO\\n\\n[h1]CONs:[/h1]\\n\\n- the new player experience is lacking; find experienced players that are willing to help\\n- quite addictive in an unhealthy way\\n- you can enjoy the game without buying anything, but in many cases buying the DLCs feels necessary\\n- DCV (you\\'ll understand)\\n- TELESTO',\n",

       "  'review': 'After probably what is more than 1000 total hours spent playing this game and recommending it to friends, I unfortunately can no longer conscientiously recommend the game to [i]anyone[/i]. This will be a long review below the TL;DR.\\n\\nTL;DR: A predatory 4-layer monetization model, lack of respect for player time investment, removal of past content that you likely paid money for, massive Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) content implementations, player retention mechanics, and heavily skewed update rollouts in favor of slowing player progress over fixing bugs and balance issues.\\n\\n[h1]Monetization - The Big One[/h1]\\nA Bungie employee has confirmed that with the launch of Witch Queen, both dungeons scheduled to release for the duration of the Witch Queen expansion will be sold separately for those who choose not to invest in the digital deluxe version of the game. So, for those who [b]do not[/b] like to preorder games/expansions, which is probably quite a sizeable amount of the playerbase, there will be 3 layers of paywalls in order to play all of the content releasing during Witch Queen. You will be expected to pay the $40 upfront for the expansion, an additional $10 for each of the seasons you choose to purchase (totaling 4 seasons), and another undisclosed amount for each of the 2 dungeons you decide to purchase ($5-20? each). So, in total, if you choose not to purchase the digital deluxe version of the game, you can expect to pay anywhere from $90-120, which doesn\\'t even include the separate Anniversary Pack, which costs an additional $25.\\n\\nOn top of the triple layer content monetization, there is the Eververse store (a cosmetic shop), which is estimated to rake in a few hundreds of millions of dollars each year. \\n\\n[h1]Player Retention, FOMO, and Lack of Respect for Player Investment[/h1]\\nThe games \"seasons\" are designed to keep you coming back to the game each week and keep you playing for as long as possible. Content is trickle-fed to you each week with story updates and seasonal challenge updates. The story additions usually take just a few hours to complete, but the seasonal challenges can take several days to complete each week\\'s new challenges. At the end of the season, if you complete roughly 95% of the season\\'s total challenges, you get a large drop of Bright Dust (free currency for the Eververse store). Large enough, in fact, that it seems like extreme value to attempt to complete the final challenge. But let\\'s say you didn\\'t quite get there and missed out on finishing a few challenges, but the season is over. Can you just complete them later? [b]Nope[/b]. You missed out. [b]Too bad[/b]. Didn\\'t get to see the last bit of the story from the season that just ended? [b]Too bad[/b] (some do persist). Guess you\\'ll need to watch some YouTube videos to figure out what you missed. This alone gives a severe sense of FOMO. You [b]HAVE[/b] to be there for the content or else you\\'ll miss out and it will, quite literally, never come back.\\n\\nBungie has now taken to adjusting gun perks between seasons as well. If you were grinding for that perfect shotgun with the perfect perks, but never quite got it before they decided to change the perk pool, [i]oh well[/i]. Other players now have that perfect roll that may even give them an edge in PvP, but you missed out because your luck wasn\\'t quite good enough.\\n\\nIf you want a particular Trials of Osiris weapon and weren\\'t lucky enough to get it with focused rolls, good luck. Your chances of getting that particular weapon with the perks you want from a randomly rolled Trials engram can range anywhere from 0.02% to 0.1%. You could grind this gamemode for literal days, weeks, maybe even months (since it\\'s only around on particular weekends) and still not get the weapon you want.\\n\\n[h1]The Destiny Content Vault[/h1]\\nAs of right now, all of the original D2 storyline content, as well as the entirety of the first and second expansions to be released for the game, are unplayable, because they have quite literally been removed from the game. With the upcoming release of Witch Queen, the story of The Forsaken expansion will also become fractured as a story essential zone is vaulted. Speaking of Forsaken (which, as I said, will be unplayable in 4 months), Bungie is still, [b]STILL[/b], charging $25 for that expansion. Some people will purchase the expansion for the $25 price point, the expansion will become free in December, frustrating these people, and then the content will be flat out taken away from them on February 22, 2022. Paying for content with the knowledge that you will no longer ever be able to access it sometime in the future is infuriating.\\n\\nThe Destiny Content Vault has led to a completely fragmented new player experience. Which, by the way, the DCV was implemented right after Bungie overhauled the new player experience. A bit counter-productive, right? New and returning players no longer have a connected experience when they play Destiny. They are dropped into the middle of a fragmented world and story that they will only understand by doing homework in the form of watching YouTube videos.\\n\\n[h1]Bugs and The Development Focus/Pipeline[/h1]\\nPlayers have been asking for new Gambit and PvP maps for years. Do they get them? [i]No[/i]. Players have been asking for a Gambit overhaul for years. Has it happened? [i]No[/i]. Sometimes PvP balance gets way out of line and particular guns become exceptionally strong, especially with the right perk roll. Surely it\\'ll get patched quickly, right? [i]No[/i]. In fact, the timeline it takes for balance updates is on the scale of months. Not days. Not weeks. [b]MONTHS[/b].\\n\\nYou know what [b]DOES[/b] get fixed exceptionally quickly? Exploits that interfere with player retention mechanics. Players found a way to quickly farm a resource 10x faster than the intended route? [i]Patched within the hour[/i].\\n\\n[h1]Stockholm Syndrome/Boiling Frog and Sunk Cost Fallacy[/h1]\\nSo, if things are this bad, why are there still so many people playing? I have a few theories and I speak from personal experience.\\n\\nI was victim to sunk cost fallacy. I paid for the digital deluxe editions and when I inevitably got burned out on the game, I would still play the new seasons under the thought process of: \"Oh, I paid for them, I really should play them. Otherwise, I\\'ve wasted my money.\" This is the sunk cost fallacy. \"I\\'ve spent money on this game, I [b]HAVE[/b] to play it to get that value.\" \"I\\'ve invested so much time into this game, I [b]can\\'t[/b] stop playing now or that will have all been for nothing.\" During my stages of burnout, never once did I load up the game actually excited to play, it was only to continue making my investment and to satiate the Fear of Missing Out.\\n\\nThen there is Stockholm Syndrome. People who are literally so addicted to the game that Bungie could make any negative decision in the world and these particular players would still try to justify Bungie\\'s actions. You see this quite clearly with the new dungeon monetization model. \"It\\'s not so bad, it means we may get even higher quality content!\" \"This doesn\\'t matter to me, because I\\'m a diehard Destiny 2 fan who [b]ALWAYS[/b] buys the digital deluxe version of the expansions. Who cares!?\"\\n\\nPlace a frog in a pot of water and slowly increase the temperature until it dies, none the wiser (Boiling Frog). Bungie is doing this by squeezing your wallet with every single piece of content they offer. When season passes became a thing: \"They need the extra money for dev purposes, it\\'s fine.\" Dungeons historically were included with either a season pass or an expansion. Now, that is no longer the case. On one side you have players saying that this is over the line and the other side arguing that \"it isn\\'t so bad, they probably need development money\" (AKA the boiling frogs). Right now, it\\'s dungeons, but who\\'s to say that in another year\\'s time exotic quests (which are also currently included in season passes) won\\'t also be monetized separately?',\n",

       "  'review': \"I wanted to do this for a while.\\nGameplay and (audio-)visual Destiny 2 is an incredible game. The feeling and look of the weapons, how you interact with the world around you is something you’ll find just very rarely. Every Element of the world is visually thought out and the sound design of the game, especially with the newest game extensions just superb. How you can customize your own character can fascinate for hours and lets you tell your own whole story.\\nThought the rest:\\n\\nI started back in December of 2019. A friend asked me if I wanted to join, I never really played an MMO like Destiny 2, so I thought okay, lets give it a try. And I was Instantly hooked.\\nIt was just this mysterious Game where you could explore what felt like an entire star system for itself and just explore the different worlds, each telling a different story.\\nAnd this game had a certain kid of magic. There just was so much to discover, the moment when a Quest for an unknown exotic weapon popped on your screen with special Activities and gorgeous new places bound to it. And oh boy the Raids. The Leviathan Raids were visually just stunning.\\n\\nAnd then, in the November of 2020 Bungie just removed all that magic the game had for me. With the new Beyond Light DLC they decided to remove 40% of the explorable Planets, \\nThey removed activities that just made the game what it was,\\n3 whole campaigns, \\nbeloved activities like 'The Whisper’, ‘Zero Hour' the whole Black Armory and its weapons, and screw it, I even miss the ‘Escalation Protocol’\\n\\nAlso, they went removing 21 of those quest for exotic weapons, that made a huge part of the game,  while leaving 6 in game. Those Weapons are still obtainable in game, though to obtain them you need to grind out in some cases a dozen hours just to get enough materials to buy a certain one.\\nAdditionally they took 5 of the 7 Raids from the game.\\nAnd what they added were 2 Planets, one being a recycled one from the previous game. \\nWith Stasis they gave us a new subclass element, players could abuse, which made the PvP-section of this game the most obnoxious part of the game for 7 Months while fucking up the weapon Meta again.\\nMaybe they achieved to better out the game with new contend and new Ideas coming with each Season?\\n\\nThey did somewhat. I mean they added 2 new exotic Activities to get an exotic weapon from. Now with random rolls and perks. So if you aren’t happy with you EXOTIC WEAPON you need to grind and repeat an activity that is getting repetitive after 3 times.\\nwhile talking about repetitive. \\n\\nThis is the Vendor-thing of season 10\\nhttps://ibb.co/bzXbSJC \\nHere we have one of the 3 main Vendors of the new DLC\\nhttps://ibb.co/0Ff8kyf \\nThe main Vendor of season 12 in some smaller form\\nhttps://ibb.co/ZdQP4zd \\nthe Artifact u need to unlock if you want any seasonal Gear (12) that is not gained randomized\\nhttps://ibb.co/Bt3M8ss \\nand look what we got for the current season (14) again :D\\nhttps://ibb.co/gZVPHnV \\n\\nOf course they added a lot of weapons after they also struggled with this after Beyond Light and tbh, some of the are incredible fun.\\n But hey, we got the 6 new rewards for one of the pinnacle activities of the game,“Nightfalls” \\n\\n all of them being old, recycled Destiny 1 weapons with 2 more incoming.\\n\\nThe Raid added with the beginning of Season 14 is returning one from D1.\\nThe weapons added for one of the harder PvP modes, Iron Banner, in the last 4 seasons are 2 new designed and 8 being recycled back from the earlier days of this game.\\n\\nBut I have to admit that it is pretty hard to come up with new content consistently for 4 years now, especially with a new season coming every 3-4 months. \\nAnd its not like they didn’t delivered content, we got a really good new raid, a slowly growing base of good and creative activities and a high new arsenal of powerful and just enjoyable weapons.\\n\\nI just personally feel like this game just isn’t about the fun, the world itself anymore, \\nthe whole goal of players now is to get a high enough light-level to do something they did in the past season already, just to instantly start grinding for the next season’s level-cap again.\\nMost of the weapons you'll find, will get dusted in your vault at some point.\\n\\nThat all is why I really don't want to recommend this game anymore, it is just grinding in its purest form, and everything about this game has just got so repetitive.\\nBut to be honest the game might just have burnt me out on a personal level.\\n\\nThere is one magical thing that survived all of Destiny’s Lifetime and is the reason I am launching the game at certain days. The Community.\\nThe Community is what makes this game maybe so special. I met incredible people, made friendships and began to love the playerbase. There may be some cheaters in the PvP parts of the game and in some rare cases people who get toxic, but the playerbase in the most parts just is so incredible wholesome, helpful and cooperative.\\n\\nTho after all I am thankful for all the memories I could make with that whole thing\\nI just want to thank everybody, I am happy that I met all of you :)\\n\\n\\nhave a good one y’all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe fun thing about this whole rant is that, almost a year ago, even before BL released another D1-Vet left the game and told me that he just felt like the game has gotten too grindy and repetitive.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Forsaken gave me hope that Destiny 2 would finally achieve the greatness that Destiny 1 was after it\\'s last DLC. Even more so, when Bungie finally split with Activision which made me think at first that everything is going to be great from now on. I thought Shadowkeep was not just going to be a good DLC, but also a positive turning point for the series so I immediately bought the entire Season Pass bundle. But sadly Destiny has disappointed me much more than it has positively surprised me\\n\\nThe new Seasons just suck. The new \"content\" isn\\'t content, let alone new content. You basically are just playing old stuff to earn old stuff with a few new things mixed in. Season Passes should ATLEAST come with a Strike, Crucible Map and a Gambit Map. Even that is such a bare minimum but instead we get to grind Bounties which is definitely the type of grind I\\'ve been always looking for. The \"new content\" is either just a new horde mode or gear that they recycled from Destiny 1 and if they add actual new gear that also looks cool, it almost always is something from the Eververse. Taking for example with Shadowkeep\\'s launch. We have the launch of a new raid: Garden of Salvation. A Garden Vex based raid that has us fighting our way through the mysterious black garden from D1. Within it we get a RESKINNED set of armour, a new exotic weapon quest, some kinetic and energy weapons and god fucking forbid why there is no heavy weapons is beyond me. A very below average loot pool I would say for a newly released expansion raid. However, there is no ship, no sparrow and no ghost within this raid. Except what should be considered the ship and sparrow for this raid is locked behind the premium tier of the season pass. And a Vex Harpy Ghost shell \"Harper\\'s Shell\" can be purchased from EVERVERSE. Why wasn\\'t any of this moved to help fill the absence of loot in a end game activity. Honestly there needs to be some kind of respect put towards these cosmetics Bungie. If you are designing something that is themed to a certain activity or season, don\\'t hide it behind a Eververse paywall and actually put it down as a earnable reward in activites. It shows that we have gone and earned them through either a loot drop in a end game activity or like you\\'ve done before, certain high tier triumphs so as they are not as rng loot dependant. Why not have the Thorn ornament as a reward for solo flawless, creates a sense of..........pride and accomplishment for doing so, rather then just an emblem. Before finishing this review I quickly just want to point out a few other things\\n-Surprisingly small Trials pool with the armor being yet another reskin.\\n-No ritual weapons.\\n-Quite a lot of hackers\\n-More error codes than you could humanly count\\n-Still no vendor refresh.\\n-This season is a bounty simulator, again.\\n-Strikes are STILL useless after YEARS of feedback.\\n-Another season without a raid with no word of how often we can expect them or even when we can expect the next one.\\n-Eververse seems to get the most attention. Looks like the only balance bungie really cares about is the one for my bank account.\\n-Just the general amount and quality of content is lacking.\\n\\nIt honestly feels like Destiny 2 has been in a slow decline since they parted ways with Activision, because at that time they got someone to put pressure on them to make actual content. Wether the content was good or not, it was still content and not hours of Bounty grinding, which doesn\\'t mean that I want them back because the Eververse is already bad enough.\\n\\nEdit: The new event \"Guardian Games\" is about deciding which Class is the best one, not by doing challenges that take skill and would be fun, but by boring bounty grinding. Bungie is really putting a hell lot of effort into these huh ?',\n",

       "  'review': \"Edit: This review was written before Witch Queen launched and was initially negative, I still stand behind most of what I said, without a DLC to hold your hand it will be rough as a new player.\\n\\nBut if you were on the fence, I can wholeheartedly recommend buying the Witch Queen DLC and jumping in right now. The campaign is absolutely amazing and is a perfect start for new players. It offers backstory/lore, a great villain, a challenge (on legendary) and an actually interesting story.\\n\\nBut most importantly, even if you don't buy the DLC, you no longer have to grind for 20+ hours to enter the Vault of Glass raid. You could try out some of the best content Destiny has to offer, straight away, although I would advise getting some gear first.\\n\\n\\n\\n- - - [h1]OLD REVIEW[/h1] - - - \\n\\n[h1]Become Legend[/h1]\\n\\n[h1]Preface[/h1]\\nAt the time of writing, I have spent 2437 (1580 + 857 orbit) hours in total on Destiny 2, since the Warmind expansion in 2018. There is only one other game I’ve spent more time on.\\n\\nThis game has given me some of the best gaming experiences I’ve had and probably will keep doing so: doing the campaigns with friends, my first underleveled nightfall as a kinderguardian (read new player), being carried through the first weekend of Whisper (thanks Java), farming EP for Ikelos-SG, my first raid (thanks Mortais), making friends, sherpa-ing others, participating and failing the day 1 LW, getting LH, getting the Rivensbane seal, going blind into the dungeons on day 1 with friends, solo flawlessing all dungeons, getting a week one completion in the CoS and GoS raid, lowmanning Levi/EoW/CoS, earning Not Forgotten and the Unbroken seal, scrims, going flawless, forming a proper team to stay up all night and get the day 1 completion for both DSC and VoG…\\n\\nWith that all said, how could I not recommend others to start playing and ‘become legend’ too? The game is great, gunplay/music/areas amazing, loot and community mostly good.\\nWhat’s not to like?\\n\\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\\nThe highest highs go paired with the lowest lows. Destiny 2 is hard to get into nowadays, don’t be fooled by the F2P tag, the ‘new light’ (read new player) experience is bad and doesn’t resemble the full experience in the slightest. \\n\\nThere are a lot of unexplained mechanics, everything can feel overwhelming at first, and then at some point you probably realize that there’s nothing left to do except grind strikes, crucible and gambit for the foreseeable future. Strikes turn stale fast, crucible is where new lights get extinguished and gambit is gambit. You might discover the Prophecy dungeon at some point, which might be a brick wall for some, but definitely fun for a couple clears. So what now?\\n\\n[strike]Wait, the F2P raid, the crème de la crème, Vault of Glass?! Well, first you have to grind all the way up from level 1100, to the soft-cap at 1270, grind powerful rewards for a couple weeks until you reach 1310-1320. All in all probably around 25-30 hours’ worth of doing the same activities over and over. This isn’t bad per se, but once you reach 1270 the grind slows down hard. As a new player back in 2018 I hated seeing my progression be time gated.\\n\\nWithout any dlc to hold your hand, this will be a rough and boring grind.[/strike] See edit, this no longer counts\\n\\n[h1]The worst[/h1]\\nSo you’ve made it through the entire grind, finished your first raid and are thinking about checking out the paid content.\\nWhile the money/spent-time ratio is pretty decent imo, and the campaigns can help guide new players in a fun way, do be prepared to spend quite some money and time.\\n[list]\\n    [*]Forsaken: 25€ -> Shattered Throne + Last Wish raid\\n    [*]Shadowkeep: 25€ -> Pit of Heresy + Garden of Salvation raid\\n    [*]Beyond Light: 40€ -> Deep Stone Crypt raid\\n[/list]\\t\\nWith upcoming:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Anniversary Dungeon: 25€\\n    [*]Witch Queen: 40€ OR Witch Queen + 4 seasons + 2 dungeons: 80€\\n[/list]\\t\\nIn total you’re looking at 80€ for the current content and another 100€ for upcoming. This alone can be a hard sell, so definitely don’t buy everything at once, maybe check out Forsaken or Beyond Light, try a single season, buy only Witch Queen on 22feb. \\nDo be warned though that content you paid for can and will disappear sometime in the future. The Forsaken campaign will leave in February. Previously we’ve lost 3 campaigns, 2 dungeons and 5 raids.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nI love the game and will keep playing it for the time being. But I can’t recommend it to new players, because it’s a mess.\\n\\nAs a new light you’ll need someone to hold your hand and even then it’ll be rough. I’d tell you it’s worth it in the end, but odds are against you, I’ve had way more friends give up on Destiny than get into it, currently sitting at 9 to 1.\\nIf you do decide to go for it, good luck, welcome to the community, join a clan, enjoy your firsts.\",\n",

       "  'review': '(Bungie fell from grace and added a shitty Battle Pass and have upped their microtransaction-game.)\\n\\nIf I were to describe Destiny 2 in a single sentence it would be: repeat infinitely, achieve nothing.\\n\\nDestiny 2 will never allow you to feel powerful. No matter how much you play, you will always be as strong as everyone else. No matter how long you spend grinding bounties, how many raids you do and how many dungeons you do you will never feel like you achieved anything. Every gun, every piece of armor is so similar, the biggest difference between them is how they look. And to make matters worse, shotguns, snipers and other more powerful guns have so little ammo, that there\\'s no point in using them. It\\'s usually quicker to just kill the enemies with your main gun than to swap and take 5 shots with a somewhat better gun.\\n\\nFor the same reasons you can only equip a single piece of exotic armor and  a single exotic weapon at once. It\\'s not because they\\'re any good, but it\\'s because if you could actually equip some of those cool pieces of gear you spent a hundred hours getting you would feel like you achieved something. Exotic powers range from making you run a little faster, to throwing grenades a bit farther, to giving energy to people around you wearing the same exotic. On their own, they\\'re so weak, almost none of them are worth using. It\\'s the same with guns. Some of them are actually good, but you can only equip one, so why bother grinding for more of them? Why bother doing the missions and challenges you paid for when they only give you a good gun you will never use? So few of the exotics are worth using, there\\'s no point in grinding for them. (Most of them are random drops, so you can\\'t actually even grind for them).\\n\\nDestiny 2 is a game for people who loves doing the same thing over and over again. \"Kill 10 Vex\" \"Kill 10 Vex on Mars\" \"Kill 10 Cabal on Nessus\" \"Go stand over there for a bit\" \"Do that dungeon again 3 times, but with harder enemies\". None of the missions give you anything good, anyways. Some glimmer and XP, and sometimes a gun or armor you will use for 5 minutes until you get one with a higher Power Level. It\\'s a waste of time. \\n\\nGo play Borderlands 3 instead. It actually lets you feel a bit of the power and fun you grind for, and weapons are actually unique.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Came for the dancing, stayed for the respawn simulator. Anyway, been wanting to play Destiny ever since it was first released. Happy to say I am not disappointed. I suck at absolutely everything there is, but it's fun. And even more so if you have someone to play with. Probably the first game I don't want to solo.\\n\\nEDIT:\\nMy feelings about this game have changed a lot since I wrote this review. I hate Destiny. I hate this game with a passion. I hate bungo, actually. The game has so much potential, but with every change it feels like they're trying to run it into the ground with laziness and changes that make zero sense to anyone. \\nAND YET \\nI can't stop playing. It's not even addiction, trust me. I said in my first review that ''it's better when you have someone to play with'' and that was when I played with people I knew from before. But now it got a whole new meaning as I'm actually meeting new people through the game and playing it literally only because of those people. As someone with social anxiety, I never thought I'd live to see myself use voice chat. It used to be the same as a death sentence. I am not joking! \\n\\nIn a way, I can say this game helped me a lot. Never understood the interest people have in co-op and multiplayer, but I think I see it now. Not everyone is a toxic asshole you want to slap out of existence. Some people are genuinely friendly and fun. Nothing relaxes me more after work than starting D2 up and doing literally anything, even idling in Tower and pushing whoever's afk off of it to their death, in good company.\",\n",

When you first hit 50 there's a lot 'island quest' storylines to complete, reputation quests to unlock, new guardian fights/new dungeons/new raids to experience, some 'sea events' and other 'timed events' to check out. Progression feels pretty good and smooth (until you gear gets around +9, the +10-+15 upgrades are significantly 'harder' to succeed => More fails => More costs => Way slower progress).\\n\\n+ The equalized arena PvP is fun although very CC-heavy and takes a little learning curve to get into. However the rewards are quite poor beyond the 'weekly' ones, so unless you are really into PvP you probably won't spend a lot of time playing it. The ranked PvP is only TRUE SOLO QUEUE, so no premades (which is pretty fun for solo players!).\\n\\nWhat does this actually have to do with potential P2W and 'forced alts'?\\n\\n+ Kinda tricked you with the topic. The game is a fun journey even before you need to think about spending.\\n\\nTo the actual topic:\\n\\n+ Once you hit your first progression wall (starting from +9 / +10 upgrading) you'll start to see yourself being handicapped by various resources. It might be materials (drops from limited daily dungeons/daily quests etc.), it might be shillings (daily dungeon/daily quests/'limited' cube dungeon), or it might be gold (weekly dungeons/weekly raids/weekly quests). To get through this wall you'll either need to just take it slow (log-in and do your daily/weekly things) or go faster (start making alts that allow you to farm more of the aforementioned) or go super fast (start top-upping with $/€'s and turn that into gold to get the resources needed for the upgrade gamble).\\n\\n+ 'Taking it slow' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character\\n\\n+ 'Going faster' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character + 1-2 hours or so per WEEK per alt character\\n\\n+ 'Going super fast' is only limited by your bank account <- beware though getting to 'max gear' as soon as possible removes many gaming goals you might have when 'taking it slow' or 'going faster'\\n\\nNow there are other monetizations that boost your progression in various ways but these are laid out in other posts and are not that significant. Basically with 50$ you'll get all the permanent things you'll ever 'need' and then you have the option of running the recurring 'crystalline aura (sub)' for extra benefits. The only thing I'd raise as a 'must-have' is the pet which is around 5-10$ and it's ACCOUNT WIDE, so you'll only need one of them. The reason for the pet is auto-looting, which is a major convinience for your daily dungeon running (the pet picks up the constant loot pinata from the daily dungeons instead of having to run around furiously smackin the loot button). Pets are also given out through events so you are likely to get one for free sooner or later.\\n\\nTLDR; The game is a fun journey from 1-50 regardless of whether you spend a single dime or not. When you get to the mid-late game (of the current patch) you'll either take it slow (1 character), go faster (alts) or you go super fast (spending $/€'s).\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I know what you\\'re thinking, \"Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!\" Well, that\\'s the funny thing about this game. You don\\'t really realize what you\\'re getting into until you reach the true endgame. I\\'ll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. \\n\\nFirst off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there\\'s certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is.\\n\\nI reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn\\'t coming from your friends, or other players, no, it\\'s coming from the devs. They\\'re laughing at you. \"Look at this loser\" you hear them say, \"he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot\".\\n\\nNow I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it\\'s very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. \\n\\nThe last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself \"Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don\\'t, quit, and live a happier life?\" So I did. I don\\'t think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention...\\n\\nBasically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I didn\\'t like how this game made me feel anymore. I wasn\\'t having fun anymore. I\\'m sick of hearing laughter in the distance. I\\'d rather be happy. I\\'d rather spend my time on things in life that add value and joy and peace to my soul. This game just feels like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to get me to buy some and hang out with them. Fuck that.\\n\\nOh, and the game\\'s bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed.\\n\\n*edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn\\'t played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more afterwards to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon\\'s are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It\\'s not worth it. As new games and MMO\\'s come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on. Thanks for reading.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’m going to write this review in the hope that new players gets a basic understanding what they’re gonna get into. At the time of writing, I stopped playing the game almost 2 weeks ago. Today I logged in to take a snapshot of my character screen (like a souvenir) then I uninstalled. This is going to be a thumb-down from someone who have spent 2,000 hours in this game... yeah, I’m going to be *that* kind of person for once.\\n\\nLost Ark is a game that gives you a lot of thing to do but you’re not going to particularly enjoy it. If I have to give an honest opinion about how much I enjoyed Lost Ark in the 2k hours I’ve played, I’d say maybe 20% was fun while 80% was a waste of time. The game WANTS you to waste that time so that you get to the good part.\\n\\nReminder: I’m writing this for NEW PLAYERS. So, existing players who gonna read this and comment (I won’t disable comment, criticize within reason) just keep in mind that your/our experience from launch and the experience of someone new today is going to be a stark contrast.\\n\\nThe story is just your average MMORPG shtick. Very likely you’re going to stop paying attention at the poor English localization half hour in the game and you’ll start mashing your G key (thus the meme you might have seen already). You’re going to press G for the next 12 hours or so if you’re fast and you don’t get too sidetracked. Else you’re looking about 15 hours of G-spamming.\\n\\nThe story is not compelling, you get an occasional cool cutscenes which pretty much tells you everything you need to know then you are sent on your way to do the tedious of story question: Go to X, speak with this NPC, spend 1 minute to go to Y, Speak to this NPC, go back to X and speak with that NPC again, rinse and repeat ad-nauseam.\\n\\nYou do the above for 12 – 15 hours before you hit “Tier 1 gear” at which point you start shifting in what’s gonna be your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark career.\\n\\nThe progression from T1 to mid-T3 is going to be brutal for you. It’s a dead zone, YOUR dead zone. There’s only bots wherever you’re going and the content you can do barely has players to help you with. This is literally going to be a phase where you’re going to spend roughly the next 100 hours (realistically it’s going to be closer to 200 hours) to get in a decent spot in T3. “Decent spot” is an always moving target as the game gets new content and the playerbase keeps moving forward. How tedious it’s going to get there all comes down to how merciful (or in touch with the playerbase) the dev is feeling is feeling at that time.\\n\\nAs you settle in your daily routine, you’re gonna realize how much RNG is involved in various aspect of the game and how much of it purely waste your time in a way you’re not going to enjoy. Imagine an important item locked behind a collectible that have a low chance to drop three times every week. You might get it on your first try, you might end up getting it on your 20th week (it’s a thing: ask anyone about the “Moake” hell and how group of friends gets their item drop while others are still left behind after 3 months still killing the same boss).\\n\\nGold is going to be your most valuable currency but the one you farm is going to have trash value. Why? Bots. Oh that Schoolgirl skin you see people walking around in? You can get it in the cash shop for $40 OR you can spend 45,000 gold to purchase it in the auction house. What? You’re only making 3,000k gold week? Well, tough luck! Save for 15 weeks and hope that inflation, caused by the disgusting amount of bot, is not going to make the price rocket to 60k by the time you get your 45k. Oh, you can’t even save that gold because you actually need it to hone your weapon, armor, to purchase mats, to buy dungeon/raid chest, etc, etc. Guess you’re out of luck!\\n\\nBots are rampant. About 4 months ago, I thought bots were at the worse point (looking at the price of RMT) but oh boy how wrong I was. RMT price is currently half of the price of what I thought was the worse point 4 months ago. What does that mean? The current of the game in terms of botting/RMT is TWICE as worse as the time that I thought it was worse. Inflation is at an all time high.\\n\\nIf you still manage to push through all these barriers and somehow manage to get your character high enough for the end-game raid content then congrats! Also; tough luck. No one gonna take you in their raid. The game is such a huge time sink that there’s very few who are willing to spend the time to fail with you in a raid because you WILL fail and you HAVE to fail to learn but the likeliness of having 7 other people who are either happy to teach you or fail with you is so low that you’re going to be spending quite sometime in the party finder just to go nowhere.\\n\\nThis game was fun back when it launched. Having a huge group of actual people running beside you in-world was such a breath of fresh air. It was fun, everyone was learning, everyone was talking. The current new player experience is a dead zone that I don’t wish upon anyone. The end-game is brutal once you reach it not because of the content difficulty but mostly due to how you’re going to get filtered out. Everything in between is a huge waste of time aimed at squeezing play hours from the players.\\n\\n\"Lost Ark respect your time.\": So we were told, turns out it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Lost Ark is alt friendly.\": When the game foundation is built upon having multiple characters, this statement is far from the truth. There\\'s so much things to do to make this game alt friendly but dev outright refuse. One of the biggest offender is materials such as Shards which are character bound. If this was an alt friendly game, Shards would never be bound. Neither Guardian/Destruction/Leapstones would have been bound.\\n\\nLost Ark doesn\\'t respect your time and is possibly one of the worse case of botting I have ever seen in an online game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I have read stories about people getting false bans, but never thought it would happen to me until it did.

I have a lot of hours, but I didn\\'t play the first couple of weeks when it was released and I still feel behind. Imagine just starting the game now.

       "  'review': 'I played the game for 445 hours. I had fun playing the game. I purchased multiple founders packs, even purchased the vanquishers pack because I was enjoying the game. One day I went to log in and found I was banned and the only information I had was a \"Code of Conduct\" violation. I submitted an appeal and after 4 days heard nothing back. I submitted another appeal and was informed that my account was commerce locked for refunding a founders pack and that the ban would not be lifted. I checked my purchase history to confirm because I didn\\'t remember refunding a founders pack and I have no refunds for Lost Ark. I appeal again and am told the matter is closed and no further responses from AGS CS are warranted. I look at the forums and find that people are being banned because they purchased skins on the in-game auction house from people that later refunded their founders packs. I was banned because someone else refunded an item after they sold it on the auction house because the skin I purchased and equipped is linked to an account that was banned. AGS is the worst gaming company I have ever worked with. They were horrible at managing New World and now they are completely botching Lost Ark. I will not recommend ANY game that AGS is involved in.\\n\\nUpdate May 1, 2022. They finally removed my ban by sending an alert saying it was an incorrectly applied ban. AGS is absolute trash.',\n",

       "  'review': '[b]If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you![/b]   Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead.  Excited yet?  You\\'ll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job!  Wait, there\\'s more!   If you don\\'t, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content.  That\\'s right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you\\'ll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you\\'ve never before dreamt of!   Don\\'t wait, apply today!\\n\\nSnarky sarcasm aside...  This is a pay to win game.  That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can.  They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that.   However, even if you pay you\\'ll find it\\'s never enough, unless you\\'ve spent thousands.   I\\'m serious, it\\'s beyond insanity. \\n\\nI have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you:  it\\'s just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content.  You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren\\'t over-geared for it, other players will  express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up.   It\\'s a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.  \\n\\nThe only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players.   All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression.   Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you\\'ll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character.  Which means you\\'ll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too.   The grind-god is never satisfied.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold.   What is gold good for?   The Auction House.  Upgrade items and gear.  Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals.   That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.   \\n\\nWhat the heck are Pheons?   They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters.  The gear you wear is what determines your item level.  After you obtain the gear, the chance you\\'ll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials.  Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in.   So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.\\n\\nHow do you get Pheons?   You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals.   How do you get blue crystals?   By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons.   Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.   \\n\\nOf course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server.   These bots have one goal - farm gold.   Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn\\'t buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue.   It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren\\'t a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag.   Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.   \\n\\nYou see the problem yet?   Even if you had millions of gold, it\\'s not the gold that is worth anything - it\\'s their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value.  [i]Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK[/i], that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups.   Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.\\n\\nWhich is another point of contention - worthless currencies.  There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum.  Maybe as many as 60?  I\\'m not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it\\'s just stupid.  Almost all of them are unnecessary. \\n\\nThere are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous \"I\\'d rather watch paint dry\" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you\\'ll try to participate in, and so much more.\\n\\nAvoid this game like the plague.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn\\'t want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.\\n\\nThe dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.\\n\\nPeople who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won\\'t replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don\\'t use the boxes.\\n\\nPvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules \"No healing potions, no ultimates\" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it\\'s my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can\\'t do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I\\'ll leave it as \"I\\'m new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being\".\\n\\nAddressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don\\'t feel it\\'s a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That\\'s pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don\\'t have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it\\'s not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.\\n\\nClasses. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won\\'t be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren\\'t available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I\\'m not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn\\'t\\' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.\\n\\nSo to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I loved this game. The first part was a grind. Getting a character to lvl 50 felt like it took an eternity. But once I was able to join my friends on end game content, it was a blast. It all went to hell when I decided to start collecting mokoko seeds. One day I decided to sit at a breakable wall on Mount Zagoras and attack it to get the 3 hidden/ blocked collectibles. After about an hour and with the help of a random player, we got the seeds and then I got permanently banned for cheating. I went back and forth with Amazon Games customer service bots and they sent a final \"We can\\'t share any further information about our decision, and we won\\'t reply to further emails about the issue\". \\n\\n367 hours down the drain because I did exactly what the game developers designed when they made a wall/barrier that requires a ton of hits to break down.

       "  'review': 'I have been playing since launch and have since put 2.5k+ hours into this game. I have held out as long as I could in hopes that this game would get better because it has a lot of positive aspects – cool classes, great combat, and a wide variety of vertical and horizontal content.\\n\\nHowever, the game’s community is by FAR one of the worst I have experienced. To mirror some of the other reviews – people are incredibly toxic and gate-keeping is the worst I’ve seen in any MMORPG. Don’t have enough item level, engravings, or a specific title? You’re not getting into a party. If somehow you do make it into a group, be prepared to get chewed out if you make a mistake because many raids have a raid-wipe mechanic where all eight players need to be on the same page. Your average player has very little patience for wipes and will force a group quit after a few failures instead of communicating or trying to teach players how to do a raid mechanic properly. With that said, I have met a small number of helpful players in the 8.5 months playing the game but they are definitely in the minority.\\n\\nOther issues I’ve seen with the game that haven’t been addressed are the rampant bots and inflation. I can’t speak for all regions but on NA West, the server I play is on like 75% bots and it’s honestly disgusting to see how many of them are running around the capital cities. AGS/Smilegate claim they are doing everything they can to combat the bots but it’s obviously not working – you see items on the auction house being sold for millions of gold constantly which is obviously real money transactions happening. The price of items and blue crystals (premium currency you can buy with real money or gold, needed to buy gear and cash shop items) is skyrocketing to a point that is just laughable. The price for 100 blue crystals exceeds that of Korean servers now because of how insanely out of control the botting problem is on NA servers. A single earring can cost 300k+ gold which is absurd when an 8-man raid only gives 3-5k on a weekly lockout. Class engraving books have tripled in price the past few months – it will now take upwards of 400k gold to get 20 legendary class engraving books, depending on what your build is. As a new player, it will be extremely difficult to catch up without at least swiping your credit card a little bit. \\n\\nThe last issue I have is how prevalent RNG is in this game and maybe a non-issue for those that are accustomed to this type of game. I currently have every adventurer tome at 100% except Brelshaza for South Vern and almost every collectible at 100%, key word almost. The RNG aspect is so heavily ingrained into every aspect of the game that you could get royally screwed on certain drops for months/years if you are unlucky. For example, at time of writing this, I am still missing the Lush Reed island soul and Forpe Island sea bounty to name a couple, despite having run them every time available since launch in February 2022. Gear progression is all RNG based as well – the success rate for honing your gear to the next level drops to such a small amount (1-3%) that you could spend weeks of materials/gold just to increase one piece. \\n\\nTo a lot of players I’m sure these gripes are OK and no big deal but for me personally, this is incredibly demoralizing gameplay and feels like I am wasting so much time just to fail. I’m surprised I’ve invested as much time as I have and uninstalling the game honestly feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. If you are looking to be rewarded for investing your time, look elsewhere. This is NOT a casual friendly game.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"Let me preface this by saying this review's purpose isn’t so that I get unbanned, at this point I don’t plan to ever return and play any AGS games. This is the first time I’ve been banned on any online game and this is the point that really irks me. This is here to provide some awareness for anyone who may be interested in this game and hope that others who’ve been unfairly banned will speak out so at the very least others may be aware and AGS may actually start becoming better or competent. \\n\\nBackground:\\n•\\tOver 800 hours on the account.\\n•\\tMy characters and some relevant equipment are as follows (AFAIK, Gem levels may be all over the place, 1 or 2 level 7, most were 4 or 5, few 6), I don’t bus at all and I’ve only ridden on a couple busses mostly for new 1370s. Bought the Gold Pre-release founders pack on release:\\n•\\t1462.5 Paladin – 1x level 7 Gem, assorted other gems usually all under 5 as I just forged most of my gems for 2 x level 7 Gems before the ban; all legendary accessories 3/3/3/1/1\\n•\\t1430 Glaivier – level 4-6 Gems, relic accessories 4x3, 1x1\\n•\\t1415 Deathblade – level 4-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1\\n•\\t1415 Sorceress – level 4-5 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2\\n•\\t1415 Bard – level 3-4 Gems (new Powerpassed character), legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2\\n•\\t1402.5 Gunslinger – level 3-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1 or 2\\n\\nSuspected Triggers for Ban:\\n•\\tI’ve been selling as much stuff as possible to try to get enough for Legendary Grudge Engraving. Recently, I merged all my Paladin Gems and got 2x level 7 Gems but both were damage Gems so I moved those to my DB to reforge and bought 1 level 7 CD gem for around 15k Gold I believe (NAE Market Price). The DB rerolled the 2x level 7 Gems and sold them for 16k list, 18k BO which both sold on the market. Also sold T3 Destruction Stones and Honing Stones.\\n•\\tBought a Swimsuit skin with RC and sold some of the pieces on the Market for Market price (pretty heavy fluctuation during the final weeks of the sale)\\n•\\tBought new skins for my Bard and Sorceress and replaced some of the older skins by selling on the market for market price.\\n\\nBan and Appeal Process:\\nI found out I was banned on Sunday at around 9 PM EST. Obviously, I could not tell what triggered my ban so I sent in an appeal request at Sunday at 9:16 PM.\\nI received a reply at 9:28 PM saying that my ban was permanent and the disciplinary action was merited but they did not state why I was banned apart from Cheating which still does not tell me anything. \\n\\nI sent a reply back stating I still do not know what I was accused of and I can’t provide evidence against something I do not know, noted that my characters were the ilevels above and their gems/accessories being not high value. I also noted that most of my characters had rested bonus so I probably wasn’t botting and asking for escalation and got this as automated reply saying I’ll hear back from them within 6 hours.\\n\\nAfter that I did not hear anything back. I re-sent in an appeal on Monday and it was becoming clear that they do not read these at all and just send the same prepared responses without any review. This went on constantly so at this point I’m pretty confident that they don’t ever read these and just block you. I read on their forums that sometimes the German one may actually result in an actual person reviewing the case but same response in German. I have sent in other appeals but all had the exact same response.\\n\\nSeeing as AGS refuses to even tell me why I got banned or even bother to read my appeals, the only thing that this really tells me is that the claim that Moderators read appeals is a bald-faced lie and any CM who says otherwise is perpetuating this lie.\\nBased on what I did on my account, I suspect someone who RMTs bought my gem or skins and I got flagged as a Gold Seller as based on what I could see, RMT is not necessarily a permanent ban. This was added in my later appeals but same response. My Steam account is an account with over 200 games and is my only used Steam account, to be a used as a Gold seller would be highly illogical. Also, I purchased a pre-release package so its an old account.\\n\\nNow why am I making this review? After reading the forums and Reddit about these posts, there’s usually some people mentioning that their friends also got banned unfairly but just gave up. Seeing as some of these posts are starting to crop up more, I would implore them to make some noise about it so that AGS may finally have to act. At the very least, it can provide a warning to anyone on the fence that this may happen to them and they should be wary. \\n\\ntl;dr - highest ilvl 1462.5, couple lvl 7 gems, sold 2 lvl 7 gems and some skins on the market and got banned. Appeals get a response in 5-10 minutes upholding the ban without saying why I got banned.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The game itself is magnificent. Surely, it may have some mobile like feel and it does have some of the sins of F2P model, but if you play the game, you can instantly feel that it\\'s a product of love by the development team. Fights are mechanically challenging, graphics are stunning, contents are more than enough to keep you occupied and coming back for more.\\n\\nSo why the negative review? Simple. The game is published and serviced by one of the worst companies I\\'ve experienced through out my over 2 decades of gaming. Amazon Games Studio.\\n\\nThey have done injustice to the game since pre-launch. Butchered the original version in the name of \"Westernization\". To watch the original director actually complain about what they\\'ve done, changing names of characters and applying censorship changes, on an OFFICIAL interview was simply depressing.\\n\\nGame launches, guess what happens. Server overload and instability every single day. Maintenance, patching, more problems, more down time, rinse and repeat.\\n\\nEconomy already went to complete ruin because despite the numerous warnings against how rampant the game will be with RMT and botters without proper measures in place to deal with it preemptively. Out of 1M concurrent you see, literally 50% are suspected to be bots because according to steam accomplishment, less than 15% of players even reach the end of leveling tutorial, and how inflated the market is is simply ridiculous. When community kept warning AGS about how this will happen, they said \"they will be monitoring closely\". What a joke.\\n\\nSo they finally \"do something\", mass ban wave. They pay news outlets to publish articles that they\\'re banning 1 million bot accounts and they should be praised for working hard to keep the game clean.\\n\\nState of the game remains the same. Guess what though, thousands of players get caught up in false positive bans but they have no infrastructure to support the appeal process. Hell, they literally closed down call center couple weeks ago after Lost Ark\\'s explosive launch. People get stuck in endless loop of sending ticket and receiving macro response without even getting an answer on why they got banned.\\n\\nYou have people getting perma banned for refunding founders pack PRIOR TO GAME LAUNCH, in many cases, to upgrade to a more expensive packs.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for trying to break down barrier that takes 15 minutes to break while listening to music.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for buying skins in Auction House because seller of the skin refunded.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for receiving mail attachments.\\n\\nWhat a complete and utter shitshow. What exacerbated the situation is that initially, Community Managers tried to gather information on the community forum to help the cases get reviewed.\\nThe next day, different CM closes down the topic.\\nNext day, these topics start getting deleted.\\n\\nLevel of unprofessionalism is simply incredible and the game really deserve better. \\nIn no other industry would this type of behavior and incompetence be tolerated. It\\'s a tragedy.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The core gameplay of Lost Ark is fantastic. The classes have unique power fantasies and are fun, and the legion raids are some of the most fun activities in any MMO I\\'ve played. Unfortunately, I can\\'t recommend the game since it\\'s bogged down by everything else.\\n\\nFirst off, Lost Ark has a severe gate-keeping problem. The game heavily encourages players to create more characters through events like the powerpass and express pass, and each new character has a set of daily and weekly activities they can do, including three legion raids per week. A total of 6 characters can earn gold from those raids, and the gold and gear reward from those raids form the bulk of gold income for an account.\\n\\nThree raids on six characters is a lot of time, and public groups for them often require proof of previous raid clear experience as a result. After all, nobody wants to waste time on wipes when they have other raids, dailies, and weeklies to do.  If you don\\'t have that visible experience in a new raid (raid titles, gear, very high item level), you potentially face hours trying to get into a group to get that visible experience to make it easier to get into groups. New players coming into the game often can reach the item level and gearing required to complete a raid, but very few experienced players want to play with them. And the game does not provide any incentive for playing with new players. The only way to do the legion raids and get the gear from them as a new player is to buy a paid carry, often using gold from the raid itself. Apart from the gold loss, a negative side effect is that players who buy carries often don\\'t get the mechanical experience of actually doing the raids, which only get more complex and challenging.\\n\\nMeaningfully progressing to the point where gate-keeping is a minor issue requires a lot of time, especially as a new player and even for the first few legion raids. This time multiplies for every character you create. I have 6 characters and doing the daily and weekly activities on them often feels like a part-time job. While rested bonuses build up for dailies you haven\\'t done, the rewards are far less than doing them every day (75-66%), which results in slower progression. The other aspect of dailies that make it feel like a job is they\\'re far less interesting than the raids. The main culprit is chaos dungeons. Chaos dungeons are basic add-clear dungeons which are similar to rifts from Diablo, but the mobs are far less interesting and mechanically complicated. Simply put, they\\'re a chore. They don\\'t encourage the kind of build-crafting and mechanical skill that legion raids do that are the most fun parts of the game. Unfortunately, they\\'re also the most valuable, giving the most amount of materials needed to progress a character. Unfortunately, Smilegate has already said and reiterated that the requirement of doing dailies on each character will not change.\\n\\nThe social systems of Lost Ark is among the worst I\\'ve experienced in an MMO. While guilds exist, the game does not incentivize playing with guildmates. There\\'s no account-wide guild membership system; each character has to join an individual guild and each guild has a low character limit. Combined with the requirement that each character\\'s name be unique, I\\'m often wondering who a character belongs to. The most developed guild feature in the game is a guild shop, which rewards currency for logging on every day and doing weekly quests, which add to the list of activities needed to do on each character. The most meaningful interactions for a guild are on Discord.\\n\\nA lot of the systems I\\'ve criticized have an easy way to circumvent them: by paying real money. With the currency exchange, you can trade money for gold, which allows you to buy almost everything needed to gear up your character: materials for increasing item level, high-quality gear, item quality increases, card set damage bonuses, paid raid carries, and more. Lost Ark even has packages with these items for direct sale. This is the aspect of the game that feels the most \"pay-to-win\", and it unfortunately drives the severe bot problem Lost Ark has.\\n\\nLastly, AGS and Smilegate interactions with the community is lacking. Smilegate in particular does not acknowledge the western version of the game in any way. Despite Smilegate stating they aspire to be a global game developer, it\\'s clear they\\'re far from it. Often AGS community managers won\\'t know if something in a patch or major update until a few days before its released. And the major issues which elicit a sluggish and inadequate response from Smilegate, as the developer, feel as if the western version isn\\'t a priority despite its status as one of the highest-revenue games on Steam. The most they provided to the western audience during their last major yearly presentation, LoA On, was a lackluster English translation. The description of a free reward pack as being \"for the KR region only\" was the insult to injury. This is behavior that is far from other MMO developers like Square Enix, and is in contrast to Smilegate\\'s Korean reputation as being transparent and engaging with their community.\\n\\nI can\\'t recommend this game to a new player. Unless someone new is willing to spend an exorbitant amount of time to gear up and find guilds and parties willing to take on new players, they won\\'t have a good time. Many friends who have similar hour counts to mine have burned out. I\\'ll also likely take an extended break soon, and potentially leave entirely. If new players are gate-kept and experienced players quit, it doesn\\'t feel like a trend that is healthy for the game in the long run.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve played enough to know what this game is and what it is not.  I will start with what it is.\\n\\nLOST ARK IS: \\n- Very pretty.  The graphics are appealing, even if not stunning. We have to remember that this game is not a new game. It has been out in other countries for years. At the time of it\\'s true release though, it was top notch.\\n\\n- Easy to play and navigate. It reminds me of a browser game in that it walks you through each quest and a very \"hand-holding\" kind of way. You get big map markers that tell you right where to go. You don\\'t even need to read the dialogue of NPCs if you don\\'t want to.\\n\\n- Deeper than it seems.  Although it plays like a simple browser game. Lost Ark has plenty of systems to keep a player occupied. There are skill, crafting and even a type of reputation system that allows the player to get more advanced items and stats. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here. I could see spending more time playing with these systems than actually hacking and slashing in some circumstances,\\n\\n- Mostly a true free-to-play game. A player can play all the way through Lost Ark without spending a dime. It may take longer and not be as individualized (you will be playing a cookie cutter version of each character), but it can be done. There are also ways to earn in-game currency if a person really wants to do some customization of their character\\'s looks. There are some features that make the game a \"Pay to Progress\" game, but nothing locks you out of content so you can play it all if you have the patience.\\n\\nLOST ARK IS NOT:\\n\\n- Diablo. The hype train for Lost Ark seemed to be marketed toward fans of Diablo and it\\'s hack n slash mega-loot game play, but this isn\\'t a fair comparison. There are some superficial similarities, but fans of the Diablo franchise won\\'t get their fix from this game. Lost Ark is much more like WoW than Diablo, but even that isn\\'t a great comparison. \\n\\n-A game changer. As with most mega-hyped games, Lost Ark is not going to change the meta when it comes to ARPGs or RPGS. It\\'s a fun game with some complexity, but it doesn\\'t so much do anything new as it incorporates bits and pieces from other games and melds them together.  The wait was so very long for this game that it will take some time before honest reviews are common. There is a glamour spell on the game that will wear off in time to reveal a solid, fun, and less-innovative game than we thought.\\n\\nConclusion: It is a game that fans of the genre should try. There is nothing bad about it. The story is standard good vs evil kind of stuff. They stuff the game with pretty girls and macho boys, just as all such games seem to. It\\'s a decent game that had zero hope of living up to the hype. \\n\\n\\n 7.7 / 10 - Fun. Free. Worth playing.\\n\\n Note that I am not presenting a \"Pro vs Con\" list. I am not that kind of critic. Just because I don\\'t like a feature does not make it bad.  Game Devs make decisions and I am not going to second guess them in a Free to Play game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"While you are in your 24k queue on an EU server here's a guide on how to make pizza dough for a delicious pizza of your choice!\\n\\nIngredients:\\n500g '00' flour or plain flour, plus extra for dusting\\n1 tsp salt\\n½ tsp dried yeast (not fast-action)\\n400ml warm water\\nOil, for greasing.\\n\\nSTEP 1\\nIt’s easiest to make this in a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). Put the flour and salt in the bowl and mix the yeast into the water. It’s always a good idea to wait 5 mins before using the liquid to see if the yeast is working – little bits will start to rise to the top and you’ll know it’s active.\\n\\nSTEP 2\\nTurn on the motor and pour in the liquid. Keep the speed on medium-high and it should come together as a ball. If the bottom is still sticking, tip in 1-2 tbsp of flour. Knead for 5-7 mins until the dough is shiny and it springs back when you press your finger into it. (If kneading by hand, it will take you about 10 mins.) Try not to add too much flour if you can. This is a slightly sticky dough, but that keeps it light and it rises beautifully.\\n\\nSTEP 3\\nUse oiled hands to remove the dough from the hook and bowl. Oil another bowl and place the dough in it. Turn it around so that it’s lightly coated in the oil. Cover tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size. If it’s a hot day, it should only take 2 hrs to rise, but it could take 4 hrs if it’s cold. (If you don’t plan to use the dough for a day or two, place it in the fridge straight away; take it out 3-4 hrs before using. Punch it down first and bring it together on a floured surface.)\\n\\nSTEP 4\\nDivide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls (see Shaping the dough in tips, below) – dust them in flour as they will be sticky. Keep them covered with a tea towel or cling film while you prepare the toppings. (you can also freeze them in sealed bags. Just thaw in the fridge on the day, then bring to room temperature 3 hrs before using.)\\n\\nSTEP 5\\nTo shape the dough: If you want to get air pockets and a light but crisp dough, then don’t use a rolling pin. It flattens and pops the air bubbles. (Two days in the fridge will produce the most air bubbles – take it out three to four hours before using.) If your dough is at room temperature, you can use your fingers to gently stretch the dough out. Once it’s about 16cm, place the disc over the tops of your hands (not palm side) and use them to stretch it further, up to about 25cm. You can start pressing out the other discs, then wait to do the final bit when you’re ready to cook. Once you’ve mastered stretching the dough out, you can experiment with other shapes: rectangles, rounds or squares all look authentic.\\n\\nSTEP 6\\nTo cook the pizza: An outdoor gas barbecue is best for controlling the temperature, but charcoal will give your pizza a more authentic, smoky flavour. For gas, turn the flames down to medium-low so that the bottom of the pizza doesn't burn. When cooking on a charcoal barbecue, let the coals turn grey before you pop on the pizza.\\n\\nSTEP 7\\nPlace the pizza on a floured baking sheet (with no edge) or a pizza peel – this is a flat pizza paddle with a long handle, which makes it easier to get the dough on and off the grill. The flour will provide the 'wheels' for it to slide onto the grill – don’t use oil as it sticks more and won’t transfer as well.\\n\\nSTEP 8\\nMake sure the grill is hot and the flames have died back if cooking on charcoal. Slide the dough onto the grill, close the lid (if your barbecue has one) and give it three to four minutes. The dough will puff up; it's ready when the bottom has light brown stripes. Use tongs to pull the dough off and turn it upside down.\\n\\nSTEP 9\\nAssemble the pizza of your choice – see 'Goes well with', right, for topping suggestions. Remember that less is more, as the dough will stay crisper and the toppings will cook better.\\n\\nSTEP 10\\nPlace the pizza back on the grill, uncooked-side down, and shut the lid. Give it another three to four minutes, then remove when the cheese is melted and the toppings are hot.\\n\\nIf your queue is still not over you may be obligated to go to the pub for a couple of hours!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't recommend this game to anyone, here's why:\\n\\n-gate keeping culture. You won't experience latest content if you're a damage dealer class simply due to lack of supports and abundance of damage dealers. You'll be staring at a lobby screen and scrolling through a dozen of lobby rooms named ''LF SUPPORT'', making your own room is pointless because you'll be waiting for a support for hours only for your party to disband after first wipe. Of course if you have many friends and a guild you're good to go, for the introverts I'm gonna say sorry guys and gals - don't waste your time here.\\n\\n-the western publisher doesn't care. About anything. At all. Taiwanese release has been announced and it promises many ways to deal with bots, one of which is registration using a phone number, employing a real person so he manually bans bots, no censorship on female skins, you get the gist of it. The western release is a short time gamble to squeeze as much money in as little time as possible, my predictions for 2023 will be around 40+ thousand concurrent players gate-keeping each other and crying on official forums by the end of the year.\\n\\n-one of the most toxic communities I've seen, your mistakes during the end-game raids will be intolerable and you'll be swiftly removed from the party. You're a new player ? You'll be playing alone for the first 300 hours. When you reach T3 you'll probably get denied from the parties due to your engravings not being up to their standard. To reach that said ''standard'' you'll have to pay a lot of money for engravings, accessories and gems which either will make you RMT or quit when the realization comes. One of the most unfriendliest game for a new player to ever exist.\\n\\n-the routine of a non-casual lost ark player is to waste 4-6 hours a day managing 6+ alternative characters, doing chaos dungeons, guardian raids, legion raids, abyssal raids with EACH SINGLE OF THEM. If you like doing same monotonous, soul sucking in-game manual labor for 4-6 hours every single day and it's your jam, go for it. It's a classic Korean MMO formula and the soulless grind is the core of it. \\n\\n-currently the world is empty apart from few hub areas, the days are long gone when you would meet a player on a strange remote island, the horizontal content has been done long time ago by the majority of players. This game barely classifies as mmo IMO\\n\\nPlease find another game to play, this ain't it.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Original review: https://web.archive.org/web/20221016031156/https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051017496/recommended/1599340/\\n\\nTL;DR: Game is still fun and the chances of it pulling you in are high, but all you'll see at the lower levels will be bots, the inflation caused by the botting is at an all time high, completely decimating the economy, and with how the game functions at 'end game', if you do not find and join a guild IMMEDIATELY, the only way you'll be able to progress your character will be to pay for runs in which you die early on in the fight to get carried through the content. That content being the raids that you may have heard being promoted as the most 'fun' aspect of the game. Not really going to be fun 'playing' the game as a glorified doormat for weeks on end, so find a Guild, fast, if you're serious about playing. Don't expect to find many practice or free carry runs either because time is the most valuable commodity in Lost Ark. The veterans that have the experience to help have 6 characters to run these raids on and do not want to waste hours of their time helping out strangers that have no clue what they're doing, unless you pay them, of course.\\n\\nI left back around early June and decided to return to the game when the 1415 honing buff dropped recently. Figured with the buff, now would be a perfect time to return, right? Ahaha...haha. No.\\n\\nFirst, the bots. Dear lord, the bots. See, back in my day, Punika was a paradise. Sure, you had a few Utytiuwooll's and Frrwyyyojl's around, but every village is going to have a few bad apples, ya know? Well, upon coming back to the game, I see that they have multiplied like rabbit's and are now infesting the whole island. This once peaceful and tranquil paradise, filled love and lailai's is now a nightmarish hellscape with you tripping over these degenerates at every turn. What's even more terrifying is when they run up to you, stare at you with their cold, soulless eyes, and type 'hh'. Why they are trying to communicate now, who knows, but run. Run and do NOT look back!\\n\\nAnyways, upon my return I got my main to 1415, and then decided to try and do a legion raid and queue'd up via matchmaking. Nothing. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15, 20, 30, 40...Yes, 40 minutes (I am not to proud of this, ngl) spent in a matchmaking queue and the only thing I got done was finishing off a can of dr pepper, eating a granola bar and getting mauled by my cat for not giving him his treat quick enough. (Obviously completely my fault, but I am now a better trained human and have been providing him with his treats in a more timely manner).\\n\\nTurns out, no ones queue's in matchmaking for raids, you got to go into party finder to find a group. Alright, sure, sounds reasonable, right? Nope. See, the issue here is that there are no practice runs available. What I thought would be used for practice, aka matchmaking, is not utilized. So the only runs you're going to find are either bus runs (Pay me 2000+ gold so you can be a glorified dirt ornament as I carry you through the content pleb) or title runs (having the title of killing the boss already so they know you know what you're doing and they not waste hours locked in a run with people who don't know the fight. So basically, they only want to play with others like themselves) or alt runs (And you better be an alt that knows what they're doing, because if you're dying a lot, well, better have some lube ready and lather that sh*t on nice and thick all over cause the verbal assault you're about to be subjected to will be a lot easier to handle before the group quits and unceremoniously kicks your sorry newbie arse out. You're not worthy to play with them).\\n\\nSo if you're new, or you've returned to the game after a hiatus and your guild is, well, dead, find a new one. Immediately. The experience will be a lot better and it'll be mentality healthier for you in the long run. However, if you're one of those Kirito types, and don't want to join a guild cause you're just too cool for one, enjoy progressing through the game at a snails pace since a large chunk of your in game income will go toward the bus drivers. You'll end up either joining a guild or quitting at the end though because eventually you'll realize that paying 2000-4000g for your character to EAT DIRT isn't exactly the game you signed up for. You may think it tastes better cause mommy Vykas stepped in it, but it's still dirt fam. Stop. Just, no. Okay? NO!\\n\\nJoin a guild. Really.\\n\\nThen there is the inflation. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, do not play on NAW. It is going to cost you anywhere between 2900-3000g for 95 blue crystals, the freemium currency in game. The bots have decimated the economy just about everywhere, but NAW has it the worst. If you're new, try other regions first, as it will be a lot more beneficial for you in the long run in terms of cost. However, bare in mind that there is also no way to transfer your account from one region to another due to 'limitations' according to both Smilegate and AGS, so do keep that in mind.\\n\\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for your time, especially if you're an active player of the game. Honestly, I understand that your time could be better spent on your 5th alt, running your 5th set of raids, on your 10th chaos dungeon and guardian raid for the day. I'd much rather be farming chaos dungeons myself, but it's Saturday and I still haven't found a replacement guild to join, so I figured while I lick and drool all over the cobblestones in Valtan,  I'd at least type up this updated review for the game. Gotta do everything to maximize my time in Lost Ark, amirite?! Hurray for roster progression!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"In LA, you will eventually end up in a loop of incohesive mundane daily/weekly tasks done through window hopping, per mobile game standards, with little to no immersion. (Mobile MMOs fan? Keep reading.)\\n\\nYou will either require multiple alts and a tremendous amount of time to funnel upgrading resources toward your main character or a lot of money to purchase what you need in order to access the latest content on release. (Enjoy grinding/spending? Keep reading.)\\n\\nThat is, if you're lucky enough to make it through the honing(upgrading) system without witnessing all of your efforts and/or money go to waste into the RNG abyss that it is. Playing this game will expose you to gambling in all its glory. It is riddled with it through most of its gimmicks. I'm guessing the feeling I'm trying to extend must be somewhat close to going to the casino on a weekend and losing all of your hard earned money. Which is frankly, not what I'm looking for in an MMORPG. Some will cope with the fact that there is a pity system. Pitiful indeed. Lets be fair though, going to the casino is a choice and so is playing this game.\\n\\nExtra features: \\n                         - World breaking record for game with the longest booting time.\\n                         - Random crashes and/or disconnects without possibility of re-entry into lost content.                      \\n                         - Double digits amount of different currencies to keep things clear...ly confusing.\\n                         - Huge AH fees for minimal profit and maximum salt.\\n                         - A game so fun even hundreds of thousands of bots are playing it.\\n                         - RMTs gold selling spam included. \\n                         - Innovative horizontal content, if you're age 5 and under.\\n                         - Frequent patch delays to keep you on your toes.\\n                         - Last minute announcements for optimal surprise effect.\\n                         - Fantastic transmogs inspired from real life items like, a t-shirt, glasses or a hat.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, LA has some good content but it is weekly gated and vastly outweighed by all the frustrations encountered. Look, I played my fair share, this game seemed to have a lot of potential. The combat system is amazing and refreshing. It was good enough to keep me around hoping it would be a great MMO. Sadly, everything I mentioned above added to the utter disrespect SG and AG seem to have for their customer's time and resources finally got the best of me.\\n\\nI would also like to point out that, by design, LA will make it quite difficult for you to experience the game with your friends. More often than not, I found myself playing on my own, with strangers or even with bots. Everyone would be online simply doing their own thing. (The mobile game template strikes again.)\\n\\nOn a side note, I would consider this game to be pay to progress rather than pay to win.\\n\\nFinally, gaming should be a positive and quality experience, if not at least for the most part. This turned out to be anything but. To each their own opinion, here was mine.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Ok so full honest and fair review on Lost Ark, Im about 50 hours in right now, Lvl 43 (Soft Cap is 50). \\n- Combat - Absolutely one of my favorite combat systems of any game period. Really makes you feel badass every time you engage in a fight, think Diablo mixed with Dynasty Warriors, like just isometric carnage through waves of enemies.\\n- Quests - The highest/Lowest point for me, the game is a theme park at its core, so some quests are legit like being part of a cinematic movie and feel epic and a \"Ride\" while between missions its your standard \"Click, kill X enemies, collect X items\" rinse and repeat mode. \\n- Story - I personally like the story, everything is skippable, so if you dont want it you can move forward but there are some really good cinematic spots that are badass and others that are standard fair but the writing is solid through out but still your standard \"Hero\" story shit.\\n- MMO - Its a full fledged MMO. Groups, Guilds, Raids, Dungeons, PVP, the social aspects are well done and consistent with modern MMOs.\\n- Pacing - The game is extremely well paced imo, you are slowly introduced to game mechanics as you move forward, first 10 levels are standard fight and quest, then 20+ is more dungeons, resource gathering, then 30+ you get your Stronghold which is a full management sim, 40+ you get your ship which is a full-travel and exploration mode, etc etc.\\nClosing thoughts: The game just has a ton of shit to do, so as long as you like the combat enough to stomach the standard fair questing as you progress in unlocking the core mechanics and move on its worth it imo',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Lost Ark [/h1]\\n\\nUnfortunately i can\\'t recommend this game. Despite interesting classes, amazing skills and a enjoyable early-mid game ( leveling up your character ) the late game is just not fun...  You just farm doing same 2-3 stuff everyday then change to your alt character and do exactly the same to propably feed your main character. And then you pray for RNG god to make that 5% honing chance to upgrade your gear level. And you still propably failed it dozens of times. And then you got back to do tidious,boring stuff or joined the pit of hell and payed dozens of $$$ to buy that honing gear only to throw that sweet money of your to oblivion. Again.\\nDespite this and army of bots that is invading the game... u can still have some fun as F2P player like me, there\\'s some really cool scenes/story missions but overall most quest expierence is that you will be most likely just hitting that skip button \"G\". Then kill 2 gyus standing next to the npc or bring some sweet flowers cus he can\\'t pick them from 4 meters from his spot... and your\\'re done for. Do some similiar quest 100 times, then u got that one interesting story mission and of course u guess it.. [b] REPEAT. [/b]\\n\\nUpdate: Bruh because a lot people cry, \"have you never played any mmo!?\" I did, but grinding in Lost Ark fells just unrewarding, unejoyable and boring. If you enjoy doing exactly same thing dozens of time just to have that Number +1 to the equipment then good for you ^_^. \\nIt\\'s my personal opinion and deal with it :D',\n",

       "  'review': \"Me and my friends played Russian version of Lost Ark and already have some kind of opinion on the game. First 50 levels are just spamming G button and it can get boring really fast to the point that you will just quit. Bear with me and get to 50. Maybe to some people story will look interesting, so they won't have any problems reaching level 50. After you reach 50 - - real content starts. Bosses are challenging, dungeons are fun and diverse. You can collect mokoko seeds, cards and other collectible items which give you some advantage. You can sail on your boat to other island and explore them for various content. There is a lot to do in the game. PVP arena is equal so no one can pay their way to highest ranks, It takes skill to get to the top. If you are into PVP - Lost Ark is a must play. This game is a good quality Korean mmorpg.\\nBut it has timegated progress and heavy alt characters dependence. If you want to progress significantly faster - you will need to create alts. Not just one, but many of them. This is a big problem of this game, especially if you never played korean mmorpg before. Basically at the end, Lost Ark becomes your second job if you want to progress faster.\\nAmazon promised less agressive monetisation compared to Russian and Korean versions of the game. Monetisation is not a big problem in this game if you ask me. I have never payed a dime and still enjoyed the game to it's fullest potential. But some people think that it needs some kind of rework. We will see how it pans out.\\nTo conclude my graphomania, give Lost Ark a chance and play it. After all it's a free to play game so you won't lose anything.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"While you are in your 24k queue on an EU server here's a guide on how to make pizza dough for a delicious pizza of your choice!\\n\\nIngredients:\\n500g '00' flour or plain flour, plus extra for dusting\\n1 tsp salt\\n½ tsp dried yeast (not fast-action)\\n400ml warm water\\nOil, for greasing.\\n\\nSTEP 1\\nIt’s easiest to make this in a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). Put the flour and salt in the bowl and mix the yeast into the water. It’s always a good idea to wait 5 mins before using the liquid to see if the yeast is working – little bits will start to rise to the top and you’ll know it’s active.\\n\\nSTEP 2\\nTurn on the motor and pour in the liquid. Keep the speed on medium-high and it should come together as a ball. If the bottom is still sticking, tip in 1-2 tbsp of flour. Knead for 5-7 mins until the dough is shiny and it springs back when you press your finger into it. (If kneading by hand, it will take you about 10 mins.) Try not to add too much flour if you can. This is a slightly sticky dough, but that keeps it light and it rises beautifully.\\n\\nSTEP 3\\nUse oiled hands to remove the dough from the hook and bowl. Oil another bowl and place the dough in it. Turn it around so that it’s lightly coated in the oil. Cover tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size. If it’s a hot day, it should only take 2 hrs to rise, but it could take 4 hrs if it’s cold. (If you don’t plan to use the dough for a day or two, place it in the fridge straight away; take it out 3-4 hrs before using. Punch it down first and bring it together on a floured surface.)\\n\\nSTEP 4\\nDivide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls (see Shaping the dough in tips, below) – dust them in flour as they will be sticky. Keep them covered with a tea towel or cling film while you prepare the toppings. (you can also freeze them in sealed bags. Just thaw in the fridge on the day, then bring to room temperature 3 hrs before using.)\\n\\nSTEP 5\\nTo shape the dough: If you want to get air pockets and a light but crisp dough, then don’t use a rolling pin. It flattens and pops the air bubbles. (Two days in the fridge will produce the most air bubbles – take it out three to four hours before using.) If your dough is at room temperature, you can use your fingers to gently stretch the dough out. Once it’s about 16cm, place the disc over the tops of your hands (not palm side) and use them to stretch it further, up to about 25cm. You can start pressing out the other discs, then wait to do the final bit when you’re ready to cook. Once you’ve mastered stretching the dough out, you can experiment with other shapes: rectangles, rounds or squares all look authentic.\\n\\nSTEP 6\\nTo cook the pizza: An outdoor gas barbecue is best for controlling the temperature, but charcoal will give your pizza a more authentic, smoky flavour. For gas, turn the flames down to medium-low so that the bottom of the pizza doesn't burn. When cooking on a charcoal barbecue, let the coals turn grey before you pop on the pizza.\\n\\nSTEP 7\\nPlace the pizza on a floured baking sheet (with no edge) or a pizza peel – this is a flat pizza paddle with a long handle, which makes it easier to get the dough on and off the grill. The flour will provide the 'wheels' for it to slide onto the grill – don’t use oil as it sticks more and won’t transfer as well.\\n\\nSTEP 8\\nMake sure the grill is hot and the flames have died back if cooking on charcoal. Slide the dough onto the grill, close the lid (if your barbecue has one) and give it three to four minutes. The dough will puff up; it's ready when the bottom has light brown stripes. Use tongs to pull the dough off and turn it upside down.\\n\\nSTEP 9\\nAssemble the pizza of your choice – see 'Goes well with', right, for topping suggestions. Remember that less is more, as the dough will stay crisper and the toppings will cook better.\\n\\nSTEP 10\\nPlace the pizza back on the grill, uncooked-side down, and shut the lid. Give it another three to four minutes, then remove when the cheese is melted and the toppings are hot.\\n\\nIf your queue is still not over you may be obligated to go to the pub for a couple of hours!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'SOLO player here. After about 65 hours I hit the end of the world campaign. According to some, \"now the real game starts\", but not for me. I have no interest in grinding the same raids over and over, or in worrying about optimizing my build. No, I will continue doing the side quests that I missed, explore the world a bit further, and then stop.\\n\\nAnd at the end of all that, I got a LOT of hours from a free game, enjoying the beautiful graphics, relaxing Diablo-like gameplay and variety in its story. The first continent is the standard medieval knights one, but there are also continents based on steampunk or Kung Fu movies, to name but two. All having the same Diablo-like gameplay. But in Diablo, missions (\"kill everything in an area\") would take half an hour or so, here every mission (\"kill everything\", \"collect something while killing everything\") usually takes a few minutes at most. And then you get a new goal, without any backtracking, because thoughtfully the original quest giver asked you to report to the next for your reward.\\n\\nPay to win? Not at all, if you play it like me. I have not felt the slightest inclination to buy anything. Even your inventory is enormously large, something most MMOs (especially free ones) often limit. And it seems that the economy is aimed fully at the upper levels (that I will never reach). At lower levels, quest rewards might be 200 silver coins, while rewards for simply logging in might be 100,000 silver coins. So as a low-level player, you feel richer than can be expected. You also get a mount very early in the game.\\nI am thinking about spending some real-world money as a \\'thank you\\' to the developers, but I honestly wouldn\\'t know what I should buy with that money.\\n\\nIs there nothing to complain about? Well, you are very limited in how your character looks, when you don\\'t pay for a \\'skin\\'. And I would have liked it if the view was zoomed-out a bit more. And the balancing is a bit off: some of the many systems are introduced (via optional quests) way before they make sense (like optimising your gear while you are still finding better stuff every 10 minutes). Some are introduced before they can even be completed. Like asking me at level 30 to craft something for which I needed gold; I got my first gold at level 50.\\n\\nSo if you go into this game with the aim of spending hundreds of hours on end-game content, look for another review. I see several negative reviews from players with THOUSANDS of hours. But if you are like me, getting 60 hours of fun mindless click-click action for free is good value for money.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After almost 1700 hours in the game I call it quits. Lost Ark is a beautitful game with great combat, unique and fun classes but some systems and mechanics just ruin everything and take all the fun away. I played the endgame and have an army of tier 3 alts but it still doesn't change the basic problems with LA.\\n\\nI hung in there since launch and I've been close to quitting more times but I really so much wanted the game to be a success but decision after decion out of my reach have reduced those chances little by little until I've reached the point where I am today. No more..I want to find a game where I can have fun and not be so frustrated over one unrewarding system after the other. I don't need another job, I want to relax and have a good time, something that has been less and less of the last months.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake is not AGS/SG's fault but I miss having the community feeling. The type of players it attracts don't seem to have a gamers's heart or be (oldtime) mmo players but just random players who want to play and be rewarded fast without any effort. So while it previously was fun taking my army of alts into hardmode content and Argos and earn a nice amount of gold (at least I felt rewarded for all the time and gold I put into them), completely disappeared with the influx of 1370 from one day to another when the power- and hyperpasses were out at the end of July.\\nThe amount of selfish players who don't care about others, nor their own char or the gameplay just piled up until it started being a nightmare and another job to do those hardmodes. Where I could run a dungeon in 10 min before now takes maybe an hour with repetitive wipes because people can't be bothered to gear up their class with sufficent engravings or spend 2 min on watching a video about the mechanics. They expect however others to do  the work instead. Another fun feature that turned into a bitter chore.\\n\\nThe honing system was always a big thorn in my eyes. I accepted how frustrating it was for some time but after 6 months I'm so tired of being on an emotional rollercoaster over an unrewarding system that only has one purpose: to sour up your game time. The few successes you have cannot cover up for all the times you were utterly frustrated over the amount of mats, gold and time you channelled into this system.\\n\\nAbility stones  - another awful system where you have to play casino and maybe win. If not you can go – like my friend just did – and spend 35k gold on getting pheons to buy new ability stones because they kept failing. Who in their right mind design a system that only wants to grieve their players? Stones should never cost anything but gold and the 9 pheons we just had from the event feels more like an insult to the face than anything else. Sometimes I even get a suspicion that the playerbase it being tested. How far can AGS/SG go..how much will the playerbase put up with?!\\n\\nClasses being deliberatedly slow-dripping released  - is another mind buggling decision.\\nI get it – AGS/SG want to milk the game for as much as they can as long as they can  - but the arrogance behind is that they automatically assume everyone to have been on a super hype about the game right from the get go and expect players to be there for years and hence wait for more classes.\\nI only got to know LA right before the launch and despite I'm overall quite content with my bard (and other classes that I've played) I would of course have liked to try out the rest of the classes. However there is nothing that speaks for why I should wait around for a year until all classes from other regions are coming to our version.\\nThat AGS/SG are refraining from giving the West all the classes there are in other regions just feels like another punishement or extremely bad planning – no excitement here about it. AGS/SG took that away already. It's just another annoying issue.\\n\\nIf AGS/SG want to earn dollars and euros so badly they should have done their homework better and prepared all the skins from other regions, so they were ready for the western version already from launch but LA West was skin starved and still is. Players have been literally begging for more skins in the cash shop over the months. Tons of opportunities wasted! \\n\\nGold – somehow it seems there is enough of it for every gamer (in tier 3) if you put time and effort into it but those extraordinary limitations like removing gold from rapporting in starting tiers and limits to the amount of chars (currently max 6) who can earn gold seem so controlling and unnecessary. Why punish the players when AGS/SG should find more permanent solutions against botters and RMTers instead? Why take away the few things which could have sweetened up the game for all players, who have to put up with an otherwise very punishing systems. \\nAlso give me the freedom to level and run as many chars as I please. Let me earn more gold, if I put the time and effort into leveling up the chars.\\nThe direction AGS/SG is taking to solve illegal gaming always involves more limitations and less enjoyment for the normal players these days.\\n\\nI really don't know what kind of expert team that has been supervising the development of these LA systems but basically the premise in this game is the more the player suffer to achieve anything the better. It's supposed to motivate you. Maybe it works for some but not for me.\\nMaybe it's a cultural difference between Koreans, Russians and the West but there is no way I feel more fullfillment, excitement or enjoyment in the game  by being exposed to punishing mechanics on a daily basis. It's only aggravating and demotivating.\\n\\nThe game has some sweet features like Sailing, Strongholds, Adventure tome exploring, Rapporting, Mokoko hunting etc. etc. but they are sadly all minor and can't cover up for the big unfullfilling feeling and lack of joy the rest of the game gives you.\\n\\nI'm sure I'm gonna miss parts of LA and I will keep an eye out for LA over the next year but for now my adventure ends. I've really got my money's worth of it but enough is enough.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game started off amazing.  Huge playerbase, everyone was learning the mechs, and the combat was absolutely seamless. No class felt super overpowered and all was right. However, the grind is incredibly tedious. Daily tasks are absolutely mind-numbingly boring and repetitive. I've played almost every day since launch and I wouldn't recommend to start playing now. Inflation is skyrocketing and it's impossible for new players to catch up. Progression  is limited by so many currencies and materials that you'll always encounter some sort of barrier, whether it be gold, silver, shards, or honing materials. Running low on currency? Sell your materials. But wait, if you sell your materials, how will you progress? You can't. \\nWant to play a DPS? Good luck, the giga whale who's 40 levels above you will always be accepted first, and you'll be stuck in a waiting lobby praying for a support to join your room. \\nRaids are fun, but if one person keeps messing up the mechanics, all fun is lost. Overall, the game was incredible at first, but absolutely piss-poor now. Combat and graphics are still incredible, though.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It is important to start with that I do not review games. Though I am making an exception for Lost Ark. \\n\\nMany players found they either started the game due to hype, friends asking them to join, or they had been tracking it since its Korean and Russian release. Once you start playing the game it is simple enough the combat system is kind of similar to ARPGS, not new but something different. This is where many players will praise the game for combat being smooth and refreshing. You level quickly enough and the dungeons seem fun as you progress a B list story. You are awed and impressed with the in game visuals and the feeling that you\\'re making progress. Then you hit 50 and everything shifts ever so slightly. You now are at Vern and you have shifted away from gathering gear to honing the same set. Nothing too drastic, the mats are not awful and the success rates are 100%. North Vern is now completed and for the first time you get a notification that you must hit a certain gear level before you can progress, something is starting to feel off but you can not put your finger on it. You manage to gather mats with daily quests that are very repetitive, running chaos dungeons which are mat pinatas, and you play around on islands or do events that have no real purpose other than to get you more mats/shinies.\\n\\nAfter a decent effort you finally hit the required gear level and you have felt the sting of the honing failures but it is still not overly painful. You get to Rohendal and you feel even more like something is off, things you got in the habit of doing now are just not able to be done any more. You can not really gather Makoko seeds as easily and starting to realize the fun combat is starting to feel a tad repetitive. Another notification that you must further hone your gear and this is when that feeling starts to actually manifest into something tangible. Your gathering mats for a chance to improve your gear and the success rate is dropping rapidly. You ask around for methods on how best to gather these mats and are told this is an Alt friendly game. So you spin up some alts, burn those two nice Vern power passes and have two more level 50 characters at your disposal. That feeling grows even stronger, each of these new toons also needs to hone gear, but why did you already spend weeks doing it on the first character you made. So you start gathering mats on them to pass to your Main, only to find out not all materials are roster bound, that seems like a problem. Now you\\'re logging in daily on multiple characters to gather the mats that are tradeable and after you have enough you spin the honing wheel to lose most of them.\\n\\nNow you\\'re finally on your way to Yorn, you soldier through it because by this point you\\'re no longer exploring islands or doing much else than gathering materials to keep your gear score going up. Vindication, you get a new set of gear that causes that very strong feeling to finally be put into a word \"Dread\". The game is no longer hiding that almost everything is RNG, especially honing which is a mandatory exercise you can not escape. Also the frustration starts to build as you realize those alts can no longer help gain materials because they are still Tier 1 and can not help you anymore. Do you grind them up to help with Tier 2 or do you focus only on that one character. Tier 2 honing is just as rough as Tier 1 and you\\'re doing it again with higher material requirements. By the time you hit Feiton you have come to understand nothing else in this game matters as much as gathering materials to fail at honing your gear. \\n\\nThe promise of great things to come is what your peers tell you while the developers tell you to go at your own pace. The dungeons are kind of pointless now because they are just there to do once or twice for low amounts of honing materials. Say you finally get your character to the coveted Tier 3, guess what you\\'re starting the gear honing grind again and now it is even worse than before. If you want to log in every day for login rewards, do dailies religiously, participate in events only there to feed your material addiction, and just repeatedly get told your feelings are wrong. Maybe Lost Ark is for you. Spelling out these things is only to encapsulate the reality that the publisher/developers decided for greed or ignorance to force NA/EU to toil in Tier 1 and Tier 2 for now. All you have to do is watch videos from Korea and see that this is not what new players on those servers experience. The focus is to get players to Tier 3 so they can all enjoy the same content together and not telling them to play at their own pace. Yes there are Pay to Win aspects, but everyone says it can be avoided with time and the game does not force you to do that if you\\'re willing to stick with it.\\n\\nBetween an underdeveloped community that can be toxic only a month in and some of the worst game support you will ever experience for an MMO. The Western Lost Ark NA/EU release is horrible. Yes there is something that could be great about this game, but that is not what was delivered, and right now there is no road map for it to get where other regions already are. The largest issue I have experienced is the honing rates and it is clear the publisher/developer are not willing to address this because that is not the vision they have for NA/EU.\\n\\nI recommend to anyone considering this game \"Do Not Waste your Time\". Three hundred hours in and a good chunk of money spent to try to support a game that promised to be everything it is not right now. Sure the game could become great just like other regions, it is not currently, and the longer folks stay or keep joining will only further encourage the continuation of the horrible state that is in major need of improvements. At this point it is obvious that NA/EU are getting the worst version this game has to offer. I understand this was long and thank you to those that made it to the end.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'After almost 830 hours, hear me out. \\n\\nThe game started off solid. to be honest, the content was a little overwhelming and I loved it. The combat was a breath of fresh air in terms of MMO combat systems. \\n\\nHowever, the grind is very real. I think this has to be the most grindiest game I\\'ve ever played, and usually that isn\\'t a problem for me. But the rewards for said grind just don\\'t feel worth it. Everyone says the real game starts at level 50 and an iLvl of 250, and that is very true. But it never ends. From that point on the game becomes one huge grind fest to increase your iLvl and it HAS to be done. Content in this game is gated behind iLvl, from certain horizontal activities to end game dungeon content.\\n\\nAgain, it wouldn\\'t be so bad but this game relies on a \"Honing\" system that requires materials, gold and silver to increase the power and iLvl of your gear. Materials, gold and silver are not plentiful unless you spend cash. The success rate of these hones decreases significantly the higher you go, to the point that you eventually are given the upgrade because you\\'ve failed so many times. Can it be done? Of course, with an extreme amount of time invested. But this game heavily leans towards P2W. Not in the traditional sense, you don\\'t actually win anything, but in the sense that you feel like you HAVE to pay to progress. \\n\\nAt ILvl 1400, the end game is extremely lackluster. You get 1 raid that can be done once a week. 2 dungeons that can be done once a week, 2 chaos dungeons (main source of honing materials that actually don\\'t give you anywhere near enough materials to actually hone successfully) twice a day for rewards and a guardian raid (another source of materials) once a day (for rewards).\\n\\nIn the end, I found myself logging in, doing my dailies and logging out into an alt (needed to do dailies so that you can \"feed\" your main with materials)\\n\\nIF you have no issues swiping that card, by all means, play this game. If that isn\\'t your style, you can certainly progress, just at a much, MUCH slower pace. \\n\\nIt was fun while it lasted, but unless something changes in terms of available resources, reduced honing costs, more end game content and engaging horizontal progression, I won\\'t be coming back. \\n\\nOh. And bots. Bots. BOTS. This game is flooded with them to  the point you\\'ll see 100 bots to every 1 real player.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Although I had a high number of hours in the game, I want to say at least half that was spent idling the game in one form or another, since it doesn\\'t auto-close if you trigger the afk disconnect. \\n\\nI\\'ve uninstalled it for three reasons: \\n\\n1) AGS sucks. AGS protecting our wallets is a meme in the community because they are so slowly releasing more of the (I\\'m not kidding) hundreds of skins present in the South Korean version of the game. The company devoted themselves fully to dripfeeding the worst looking skins in the entire catalog, 1-2 per month, long term.\\n\\n2) The bot problem is so out of control, it\\'s just as infested as Runescape 2 was by bots in 2005-2006. Bots in Lost Ark swarm like locusts clustering together across the starting areas of the game and the major cities zooming around with their speedhacks along the same paths. They also spam advertisements in area chat, which happens to be the one chat where anyone bothers to say anything, so you have to put up with the spam and blocking and reporting to see any human conversations in the game. \\n\\nLife skills as a result of the bot population are close to worthless. Infinite chaos dungeons are a very boring alternative for making more gold and I\\'m certainly not swiping my credit card to progress faster either. Let me put infinite chaos dungeons to you this way: some people I\\'ve spoken with ingame have described grinding them out as \"brain melting\". Others claimed it was a guaranteed road to burning out. Lost Ark players reading this may counter, \"If you need gold, just make alts!\". I\\'m getting to that.\\n\\n3) The gameplay loop is so simple and stale. If you make 6 characters, expect 2.5-3 hours of chaos dungeons and guardian raids you\\'ve already done, every single day or every 3 days if you want to get optimal gold and material gains. Argos will add even more time to your weekly quota, though it will get easier in the future as people outgear him. If reset day came and you aren\\'t running 6 1370 characters, lord help you, it\\'s time to spam abyssal dungeons which are a massive time sink across 6 alts even if you party finder for varying reasons. Maybe your teammates don\\'t understand mechanics. Maybe party finder is slow during your time of play. Maybe your teammates just want to make everyone sit through cutscenes (which require a unanimous vote to skip). If you think like me, someone who simply cannot play games in as a casual for very long, you have to play more than 3 hours a day if you want to go participate in the other content in the game, like quests, or the many collectibles or even the time gated islands that only appear a few times a day. \\n\\nIt is so easy to burn out with the current gameplay loop that even Smilegate\\'s own past statistics reflect a massive decrease in the South Korean playerbase during their version of this era of the game (pre-Legion Raids). Smilegate must have made a lot of money back then to force the Western regions to experience the same hellish era. \\n\\n* In writing this review, I came to realize a fourth reason I\\'m done playing the game. \\n\\n4) Waiting 3 days is possible because of rested bonus, which the community generally considers time-efficient. I was obligated to ask myself after waiting for rested bonuses enough times on my alts, \"Why am I waiting 3 days to play a game on a specific character?\". My answer took shape as, \"The game is almost like a bad job, the chores are so tedious\". I have never encountered another mmorpg to make me feel so bored. If I got bored in BDO, for example, I could go ride my turbo horse around the region, I could go fish, I could jump my Tamer mount off mountains for fun. If I got bored in Runescape, I could play minigames, something Runescape did best. If I got bored in Path of Exile, I could make a new build, run special maps or decorate my hideout extensively. \\n\\nLost Ark\\'s side activities are nowhere near as entertaining as the ones I\\'ve encountered in other mmos, except for PVP. Smilegate\\'s game is so extraordinarily barebones when it comes to its fun activities that I feel like it meets the bare minimum requirements to pass as a game outside of its dailies. It feels like a very poorly made skinner box. Legion Raids will improve upon my complaints but not enough to bring me back. Miraculously, Smilegate\\'s mmorpg convinced me to look for enjoyment in my creative hobbies again.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Uh I have played Lost Ark for 3500 hours, So this will be an interesting/ HONEST review.  The game is closing in on 1 year old for NA/EU so keep this in mind as I speak my opinion about this game.....\\n\\nWhere to start..... Lost Ark was a game that I had first seen a gameplay trailer for KR back in like 2015, me and the squad were SOOOO HYPE about this game I cannot lie. Was this the Diablo killer we were waiting to play? Years down the road we now have it in our hands getting to experience a game that has been out for years before us.\\n\\nWhen first playing Lost Ark at launch the \"magical feeling\" was present - kinda like a honey moon phase per say. The phase where everything was exciting, new, and fresh. Your homies were all in it, hype af and ready to play every moment they got a chance to! Right???  Ya well that phase lasted about 2 -3 months because the daily chores you feel obligated to do dissolves that feeling away shortly after you reach the tip of endgame and start the REAL grind. You would think new updates and new classes introduced to the game would help ease the unexciting and dull dailies you do to keep up with the current content would rejuvenate the freshness ...... Nah sadly if it does its very short lived - To even get a new character caught up with the pack is a grind. Powerpass, Hyperpass, Expresspass, Punicapass, Megapass, Ultrapass, Gigapass!!!! Doesnt matter how its worded its still all a tedious grind to the top - \"The Hamster wheel keeps turning\" as my best friend likes to tease us few still playing...... lol\\n\\nListen I genuinely enjoy Lost ark and everything it presents - I also genuinely dislike a lot of things that it brings. I will just touch on a few from each side.\\n\\nWhats good ? \\n- Gameplay. -  Lost Ark has some of THE BEST raiding content I have ever been a part of. It doesn\\'t get much better then this currently. Lost Ark has some on THE BEST visuals from a game running on an old engine. UE3 I think? Lost Ark has some of THE BEST Character Identities I have seen In a game recently. \\n\\n- Mass amount of content -   Lost ark has a   C R A P  ton of content available to players from start to finish. Like more then I am personally WILLING to go hunt for,  track down, and complete. Like its a lot!!!!! \\n\\n\\nWhats Bad ?\\n*Some of this will be hard to put in words to where others who might not have played it yet or play its as much will understand.* \\n\\n- The games Core Design - \\nOk, Lost Ark is VERY VERY poorly designed to introduce and bring in new players..... I feel like once the game reached a specific amount of content added to the base game,  it is now EXTREMELY hard on new players/characters to be mixed in with the current pool of players who have been playing since launch. \\n\\nAll the shear amount of intricate things needed to be \"Accepted\" in the raiding scene, (which is the biggest highlight of Lost Ark dont forget!!!) is near impossible for new players to obtain and jump in with friends or even experience the game properly...... New Account? Low Roster level? \"Nope\"  gatekept!  Character doesnt have all +lvl7 gems or higher? \"nope\" gatekept! Your character is level 52.45 not max level 60?! \"Nope\" gatekept!  You dont have Grudge lvl3 ? \"Nope\" GATEKEPT! You dont have 5x3 BiS engravings? \"Nope\" G A T E K E P T.  Keep in mind this is just a handful of many more problems this game has when it comes to the Vertical content pushing, every single one of these issues isn\\'t like you can get all these fixed in 24hours - No its a grind. Month at BEST for a new player maybe even longer..... I mean unless you swipe...... Legally or Illegally  and Im not opening that flood gate...... -_-\\n\\nI dont blame the people who are gatekeeping - I blame the way the game is designed and its poor in many ways on that note. \"Great Vision - Poor Delivery\" \\n\\n- Anti-Cheat system - \\nThe anti-cheat system used in the NA Version of Lost Ark is so bad its sad. Like Depressingly Sad. not sure how else to put it. \\n\\n- Bots - \\nBots run Rampant in the game, Amazon has yet to figure out a solution to clean it up and remove them in our version of the game. So it genuinely sours the early to mid gameplay experiences new players have when they have their first play through....... You will see many  characters named Yyyggdsfdfghesfdf running around on horseback with the new mokoko tag next to their name stating they are a fresh account. Yep. -_- What makes this a sticky fix, is the fact that this is Free to Play, you can ban wave thousands of bots - give them 48 hours and they are sprawling back to farm up gold. \\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day Lost Ark is a Dope game, that has A LOT of room to grow in the western client. But also has a lot of problems that get swept under the rug with greedy game design. I also understand this game is developed by another culture and that\\'s partly just a way of life in some parts of the world. But I also can play a game for almost 4k hours and see glaring holes that need to be fixed or filled to boost a games integrity from a player base POV. \\n\\nIts really hard to give an Honest review like this when you have invested time like this in a game. But for what its worth, I give this game a 6/10 ONLY because it has so much good going for it. If AGS and Smilegate would genuinely crack down on the problems and commit to the issues the game has my review and rating would be vastly different. \\n\\nHope this helps people who have never played but also people who are still currently playing for better or for worse. \\n\\nHappy Holidays - SlimB',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m sad to say that my very first review is a negative one and am only doing so in hopes the devs can turn this around. Below will be a list of the major issues with the game at the moment.\\n\\nIt is very hard these days for me to become completely enveloped with a game. Lost Ark stole my soul... but I sadly cannot recommend anyone to play this with the current state of the game, I really wish I could. It is an incredibly good game with all of the necessary components to compete with the monsters in the MMO genre but the Smilegate and Amazon just seem to be making all the wrong decisions.\\n\\nBefore you judge my review, keep in mind as of the date of this review (6/14/2022) I am roster lvl 172, most horizontal content done and have a 1460, 1420, 1385x2, 1370 x2, and 4 1340\\'s. Cleared all content available in the game on the week released and am entirely free to play minus cosmetics for my character, battle pass and some founder packs. The amount of time and effort i\\'ve put in to stay at currently released content is staggering as you can see by my hours.\\n\\nIF the issues I list below, specifically the botting/RMT issues, see fixes or adjustments this game is absolutely worth playing... but I don\\'t see them recovering from this one.\\n\\n1. Bots\\n\\nI have played a ton of MMO\\'s ranging from dead to prosperous, f2p and subscription based. All of them have bot issues, but nothing like this. I wish I was exaggerating when I say this game easily has 500k+ bots if not more but i\\'m not. It has destroyed the in game economy and made que\\'s to even log in 10,000-20,000 long. The devs are barely slapping the wrist of RMT purchasers and do roughly once a month ban waves targeting bots that accomplish nothing. I know it isn\\'t an easy thing to fix, no MMO has... but their attempts have only damaged the game play of real players whilst leaving a minor annoyance to the botting community.\\n\\n\\n2. The Grind\\n\\nInitially I was super pleased with the middle ground this game has, most KR MMO\\'s have systems in which gear downgraded or completely deleted if it was to fail an upgrade. Lost Ark has the happy medium of doing neither whilst provided a fail stack that guarantees you will successfully upgrade after enough fails. It still leaves in the gamble RNG dopamine hits without having infinite punishment. Sounds great right? It was... until you realize you either have to run 6+ characters to feed materials to your main to make any meaningful progress or simply swipe your credit card. EVERYTHING is time gated other than MSQ. Anything that provides materials for upgrade honing is locked behind daily/weekly content. Normally this doesn\\'t bother me but the amount of materials you receive daily in the end game is barely enough for one very low chance click a day with a few more on weekly reset. Without moderate luck you will go nowhere without tons of alt characters.\\n\\n\\n3. The leadership and communication of AGS and SGS.\\n\\nTheir communication is abysmal. They just can\\'t seem to do it... It\\'s gotten a little better in terms of talking to us about things but it\\'s a stretch to even get patch notes or an hour heads up on emergency maintenance\\'s with little to no compensation of any kind let alone an apology. In the beginning the lead developer openly stated he wanted all regions to catch up to KR as soon as possible (Korea has vastly more content than us at the moment as it was released years ago there), they have broke this promise dozens of times already in major ways. The community has collectively asked for more skin releases, more class releases faster, and all sorts of basic things along those lines in which they claimed they heard us and are working on it. Their solution? Release an RNG lootbox skin that on average takes $700 USD to complete, 1 skin a month that is hand selected from the worst selling skins in other regions and changing class releases from once a month to one every 2 months. Keep in mind ALL of this content we are asking for is ALREADY in the game in multiple other regions, it requires 0 development only localization. They openly admitted that their decision for some of these changes were based off of purely what would make them the most money as they are \"Valuable moments for us.\" I\\'m all for a company making money, especially if they deserve it, but they have lost millions basing their decisions off of business analytics where they misread the data. Out of all the MMO\\'s i\\'ve played this one\\'s leadership is by FAR the worst i\\'ve encountered. A huge majority of their decisions are made on milking money from players which in turn is backfiring and causing them to lose vastly more than by just doing the right thing.\\n\\n\\nThere are many other minor issues but they hail in comparison to the 3 above. However, the major 3 are so severe that it\\'s just a deal breaker straight up for the community. Lost Ark had so much promise and can still be turned around... At it\\'s core it\\'s still one of my favorite MMO\\'s I have ever played. Amazing combat, raids, systems, and immersive world with a below average story (It does get better way later in the game!) Steer clear of this one though unless this is farther in the future and these problems have been addressed to some degree, in which case I would wholeheartedly recommend this game 100%.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read my review and I wish you luck finding a game for you.\\n\\n**Edit: Some spelling/grammar changes.',\n",

       "  'review': 'On 3-2-2022 I received a permanent ban on Lost Ark for Commerce Lock.\\n\\nThe reason I was told I received this ban was due to a refund of a steam purchase I had made of the Founders pack of Lost Ark before the game Launched for early head start. Purchase was originally made in August of 2021 and Refunded on Jan 30th 2022.  I have screen Shots of all mentioned transactions.\\n\\nThe reason I did this refund was because I was trying to decided on which founders pack was of the most value to me and could provide the most benefit.  I ended up deciding the next day Jan 31st to purchase all packs offered (Including the Founders Pack I was Banned For) and I continued to purchase all available packs that were released after. \\n\\nThis ban should be reversed as customers like myself who not only did not realize we were doing a ban able offence, but as well a lot of players have invested money into your game with all packs, gems, etc. \\n\\nIt is unfair and unjust practice to be banned from playing due to mistakes on refunds, especially when those refunds were issued before your game was released and players never received in-game items.\\n\\nI have never had a ban on any of my 400+ steam games and I am highly disappointed that Amazon Game Studios was the first.

Now, as far as pacing goes, if you decide to play the game for free, it is quite slow. I noticed that almost immediately. Personally I am not against a slower pace as I prefer to take my time with things - I am the kind of guy that actually reads the text when I am doing quests - so for me that is not an issue. The story so far is captivating and interesting in my book so that helps tremendously with the slow pacing of the game. The art style is very typical Korean/Japanese/Asian so if you are not a fan of that, probably best to stay away - though you might enjoy it regardless. I personally LOVE the style of art and the visuals are crazy good in Lost Ark, especially the abilities of the classes. \\n\\nWhilst my opinion is of course subject to change as time goes on, there is no harm in trying this game - since it is free - and giving it a shot if you are on the fence about it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Endgame in a nutshell:\\n\\n1. Run the same braindead horde mode 2 times every day on your main.\\n2. Run the same braindead boss fight 2 times every day on your main.\\n3. Do your 3 daily fetchquests / kill X number of trashmobs quests.\\n4. Click through a bunch of menus to collect your 100 daily mobile game currencies to trade in for scraps to upgrade.\\n5. Run back and forth between 100 mobile game currency trade-in NPCs to collect your daily scraps.\\n6. Don\\'t get enough materials to even do a single upgrade.\\n7. Repeat step 1 through 6 on the 5 Alts that the game economy expects you to invest your time in, shove all upgrade materials to your main.\\n8. Have materials for 1-2 upgrade attempts on your main now, fail both because sub-30% success chance.\\n9. \"Ah man, let\\'s have some fun raids now after all these chores and disappointments.\" Oops, weekly entry limit exceeded. Only 1 entry allowed.\\n10. \"Ah no problem, I\\'ll just need a couple more item levels so I can access the next raid in...\" *takes out calculator* \"6 weeks or swiping my credit card for 2000€, nice!\"\\n11. Twiddle your thumbs as you wait for daily reset to repeat the exact same braindead content on 6 characters again, hoping that RNGesus might hear your prayers tomorrow while hating your life.\\n\\nThis game timegates EVERYTHING. Every single thing you can do is extremely timegated and they even go as far as to stretch out your daily chores by timegating fast travelling, so you better plan around that or have some cash ready to remove the timelock from your fast travel. It\\'s absolutely the most insane shit I\\'ve ever seen in a non-mobile game. \\n\\nAnd the worst thing about this is, that despite all the time gating, it still doesn\\'t respect your time. You can spend all your free time on the same mindless crap with pitiful rewards and still get absolutely nowhere.\\n\\nReally disappointing, because the game\\'s combat system and world design are genuinely beautiful.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh dear,\\n\\nI\\'ve been waiting for the game since the first video of the Closed Beta Test in Korea. Was so hyped about MOBA-like action RPG about a tripod system making it an ultimate skill-based MMORPG.\\n\\nThe first [b]10 hours[/b] start like with every other MMORPG game, you make your character and progress through the story. The problem is when the story is just [b]G spam[/b] clickfest and a walk from NPC to NPC, with tons of fetch quests in between.\\n\\nAfter [b]15 hours[/b] when you reach the 1st main city, you are unlocking the first [b]Chaos Dungeons[/b], and after some time [b]Abyssal Dungeons[/b]. The first one you can do only [b]two times[/b] per day for rewards, Abyssal Dungeons are once per week.\\n\\nThey are telling you that you don\\'t need alts to progress, so I did 5 alts so 6 classes in total. I was progressing 6 times faster than my other guildmates. I can only imagine that someone living in a 20square apartment playing video games 17 hours a day can progress 12times faster than me, you get the point.\\n\\n[b] At 200 hours mark [/b], I had 6 characters in T2 and one character in T3 content (tiers are like levels of content you are currently on)\\n\\n[b]My daily routine was:[/b]\\n\\n- run 2x chaos dungeon on 6 characters (6mins each)\\n- run 3x una daily tasks on 6 characters (5mins each)\\n- run 1x daily island (10-15mins each)\\n- run 1x daily chaos or boss run (10-15 mins each)\\n\\nand I was doing this [b]EVERY... SINGLE... DAY... :[/b] since the early access.\\n\\nI finally reached the level of 1st \"hard content\" called [b]Abyssal Raids[/b].\\nAfter clearing an Argos P1 in 5 mins I realized how dumb I was chasing the carrot that kept saying to me: it will be better later on...\\n\\nEnd game of Lost Ark looks like this:\\n1. You do the dailies until you can clear raids.\\n2. Clearing raids leave you with locked content until next week, so you are left with repetitive daily una tasks and chaos dungeons, that are brainless mob clearing grindy runs.\\n3. Do the horizontal progress (collectables)\\n4. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\nSo when the fun starts?\\n\\nWell, after you grind your way to the hardest content you can play, its about 20 to 30 mins of [b]FUN[/b] content per week, per chracter. So you can figure it out by youself.\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning in huge TLDR:\\n\\n- you can buy materials off the cash shop\\n- you can buy gold off the cash shop\\n- you can basically buy anything from cash shop even boost of characters (in future releases)\\n- BOTS BOTS BOTS (yeah that much a repetitive content is perfect for automatization, so there are bots destroying econemy every single day)\\n- to be efficient, you have to fit your life schedule to the game, as horizontal progress is time gated, at a specified time of the day/night)\\n\\n[h1] HOWEVER [/h1] [i]ending words... [/i]\\n\\nThe version of the game we\\'ve got was the worst one from KR. The game looks good and the diversity of the characters and their playstyles makes it like you almost want to play the game. PVP is balanced as its gear is equalized. English dubbing isn\\'t that bad (I\\'ve seen worse), and despite all those negatives above, I can tell that If the game gets more and more updates, It might make the review end in a positive way, but for now it\\'s a huge NO for me.\\n\\nI don\\'t recommend the game... for now.\\n\\nEDIT 23.04.2022: Formatting.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So after over 500+ hours, playing 9 characters daily &\\' almost having 6 characters in T3 i have to say that:\\nIf u enjoy a really grindy game that rewards you for playing ALOT of alts to get your main character faster up &\\'\\nyou don\\'t mind failing upgrades hundreds of times you are probably right here.\\n\\nIf you hate grinding &\\' want/need instant gratification, this game is probably not the right one for you.\\n\\nFor me this game feels like a mix between World of Warcraft, Diablo3, FFXIV &\\' BDO together.\\nWhat i mean by that is that it has the Combat system &\\' also Rifts like Diablo3 (Chaos in dungeons in Lost Ark);\\nBeing able to be a Completionist &\\' farm different kind of Collectibles and Trade skills like World of Warcraft;\\n\"Hard\" &\\' challenging Content (in the future actual hard content;Legion Commander Raids) like from Final Fantasy\\nAND of course the Aesthetic style, Cash shop &\\' a few other things like from BDO.\\n\\nSo in the end would i recommend the game?\\nWell yeah, i do enjoy it, so i would definitely recommend it if u like a grindy mmo!\\nBut remember its an mmorpg, u shouldnt \"beat/finish\" the game with minimum effort &\\' time spent.\\nTheres no need for FOMO (Fear of missing out), u will eventually be able to play the content, u dont have to\\nwhale (cash) in order to get there, if u put in time &\\' effort you can also get there, but if u cant handle that people\\ncan get there faster with spending money, maybe u should take some time fresh air.\\nSince even in real life u have advantages if u have alot of money, so be stupid &\\' enjoy your time!\\n\\nUpdate after 2k+ hours: i stepped up my game from playing 9 characters to playing 24+ &\\' i still love the game :)',\n",

       "  'review': '// OUTDATED: I don\\'t play Lost Ark anymore, it takes way too much time to get to anywhere if you don\\'t spend a lot of money on it.\\n\\n\\nWithin the past few days I\\'ve read hundreds of Lost Ark reviews on Steam, out of curiosity and... it\\'s exactly how I thought it\\'d be when the game started to be free to play. Number of shitty reviews that occurred since then is ridiculous. Whereas positive ones don\\'t tell you anything about the game and just fill up the space in reviews tab, people that gave the game negative review made me want to write a review myself. I haven\\'t read such bullshit about any game in years, so let me try to put things straight. \\n\\nFirstly, I would like to say that I\\'m not a huge fan of Lost Ark, just so you don\\'t call me fanboy defending his favorite game. Despite my playtime on Steam, I haven\\'t been playing the game as long and as much as other \"veterans\" from KR/RU. Although I started months before Lost Ark was even announced to be released in EU/NA, I played the game for only 1100+ hours. That\\'s maybe 2 hours a day on average but I still think it\\'s enough and it\\'s way more than majority of peoples\\' playtime here. Also, most of my playtime is from RU version which is considered the most \"pay to win\" version out of all.\\n\\nBefore full release the game had overwhelmingly positive reviews (96-98% positive from closed alpha/closed beta) and now it fluctuates around 70%.\\nLost Ark was (and still is) a very hyped MMO. People expected much. I think too much. If you are just a bit clever you should know that there could be problems with launching the game, especially when it\\'s an MMO genre. Not to mention that publisher in our region was AGS.\\n\\nMost of negative reviews are from people that are crying about queues, bad story, the game being \"pressing G simulator\" or petty problems that can be fixed within few minutes using Google. Maybe 2-3% of all reviews have any sense and are worth reading. The rest is trash. It\\'s picking apart you could do with any other MMO. Here are some very popular statements that people keep repeating over and over in their garbage reviews, just so you know and don\\'t spread shitword all over again:\\n\\n1. The game is made on UE3 - it is, so what? Everyone says the game starts to look outdated - ok, it\\'s subjective. Some people can say the graphics are bad, others can say the graphics are good, but why nobody mentions animations which are excellent or the fact that the game is extremely well optimized? You can run this game on potato, I\\'m having 100+ FPS on Ryzen 5 3600 & GTX 1660 Ti on very high settings in every area/dungeon/raid. You can\\'t have it all. Decide what\\'s more important to you - graphics or playability. Lost Ark to this day still looks good and runs even better.\\n\\n2. The game is P2W - show me at least one mechanic in this game which is pay to win. I think peoples\\' definition of P2W in 2022 equals to \"I can spend money on a game so the game is pay to win\". The game is pay for progress/pay for convenience, there\\'s like nothing you can get for real money but can\\'t get for money in-game. PvP content is equalized so your item level doesn\\'t matter. The only content that might be considered as pay to win are GvG \\'cause gear actually matters but nobody will buy you knowledge or skill (and you don\\'t have to attend GvG at all, it\\'s optional).\\n\\n3. The story is boring as hell - it is, you\\'re right. But let\\'s be honest, who cares about story in MMO? Despite the fact that story is boring as hell, there are still some cutscenes that are touching or actually well made (and you can\\'t skip them). If you really want to play MMO mainly for plot then run FF14, unless you can name any other MMO with decent story.\\n\\n4. The game is pressing G simulator - it is, you\\'re right. But if you\\'re out of the woods and finish tutorial, it changes. There is no spamming \"G\" for 10 hours in a row with zero other activities anymore. You can do whatever you want. I must admit that leveling process gets dull very fast and is a huge mistake but name me any other MMO in which leveling is as entertaining as end game.\\n\\n5. The game is queue simulator/matchmaking simulator - sometimes it is, sometimes it is not. Queue depends on which region/server you play on and when. At night, in the morning or in the afternoon there are barely queues (maybe with little exception for the weekends) so the only problem are evenings. If you have job, move to another region just so you can play without queues anytime or just wait for casuals to quit the game and keep playing on the region you\\'ve started playing before. When it comes to matchmaking - yes, it\\'s laggy most of the time but slowly gets better. We can just hope that litter employes from AGS start doing something to fix it as they did with IS and Aura.\\n\\n6. There is nothing to do in the game - people saying so have no clue what game they are playing or they watched Twitch streamers for too long and don\\'t know where to begin the rush to their idol\\'s item level. There is so much to do that you won\\'t finish the game within several months, even if you played 24/7 on one character. There is a lot of PvE content (Chaos Dungeons, Guardians, Cubes, Towers, Boss Rushes, Abyssal Dungeons, Abyss Raids, Legions, Gates and more), a lot of casual content (sea content, events, islands, Platinum Fields, quests, housing system, collectibles, adventure book, affinity with NPCs, life skills and more) and even some PvP content (equalized arena with rankings, PvP on islands and GvG).\\n\\n7. The combat gets boring very fast - I think the combat system is one of the best when it comes to isometric MMOARPG games. There are different types of skills (direct, aim, hold, timing, preparation, combo, chain) and there are a lot of skills for each class out of which only 8 (in most scenarios) can be put onto skill bars. Additionally, there are runes, gems and tripods that can change the way the skill behaves and so on. Even if you play the same class as your friend, you can vary a lot from them. Every spell and auto attack is also a skillshot, there is no auto aim so if you are bad you can miss everything (except spells like shields for yourself for example). The hitboxes of players and bosses are pretty accurate too.\\n\\nI ran out of space so if you wonder about any other concerns, read my comments down below.\\n\\n\\nAnother conclusion I came to: \\nI think people forgot that games should bring pleasure. Especially MMO games which are no competitive at all (or are very little competitive in comparison to FPS or MOBA games). Nowadays everyone wants to be the very best. Such people watch Asmongold or other popular streamers that spend a lot of money and push themselves to the end game, and then they want to do the same. They completely ignore everything else and forget what they were supposed to do with the game and what\\'s the game about. That\\'s why afterwards we see reviews from people that have 50, 100 or even 200 hours into the game and are bored after getting to X item level. They say they don\\'t enjoy the game but how can they enjoy it if they spent all time doing garbage storyline quests and upgrading their gear for god knows what reason?\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: In my opinion, Lost Ark is one of the best MMOs ever made but published by one of the worst publishers ever seen. The game itself is very good and once you manage to suffer for the first 10-20 hours to get past tutorial, you will probably stay for a while. Sadly, Amazon is responsible for servers and item shop, and they fucked up both of them - servers are laggy, game is sometimes a queue/matchmaking simulator and we don\\'t know what they add to IS in the future. Once the servers are fixed, Lost Ark will probably be top 1 MMO on Steam for months or even years. Content is ready to be released, the game is very polished and refined overall, all classes are very balanced and playable, the game is player friendly and very well optimized and the most important - the game respects your time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Ive never felt so conflicted about a game. Like, as a game its top notch. Ive had fun doing literally everything the game has to offer. The game play is tight, the game runs well, you can tell the game is made with real care and detail. There are things in this game ive never seen in an mmorpg and just a general level of creativeness that genuinely impressed me. The boss fights are an absolute blast and, again, had some basic but creative mechanics that surprised me in the best way.\\n\\nThen...the elephant in the room. Lets cut the shit. The games progression pathway is designed to suck you in. Resources are plentiful. Upgrades fire off without failing. Your personal damage grows MASSIVELY fast after hitting 50 it feels so damn good. However, the farther you get the more you can see plain as day that the systems are designed to frustrate you enough to get you to pay. You run out of readily available resources and have to farm it out but your upgrades are failing now. You put all that work into farming up a pile of resources you might just lose all of if you are unlucky. This game is designed to take all of your time to play optimally and then spit it back in your face to try and get you to pay. The entire loot cycle is just time consuming and the game has no respect for your time. Their only interest is your wallet. They get you hooked early on with how easy it is, how much power you gain, then they stick it to you hard and its honestly predatory.\\n\\nSo do I recommend this game? Its a great game. I loved every minute of my time here, even the story (I dont think its as bad as some would lead you to believe) BUT this is an MMO. A game genera designed to get you invested and keep you their long term. With how loot upgrades works...I just cant bring myself to recommend the game. Its good, ill always play it casually but this will never be a \"Main MMO\" just simply because I dislike wasting my time and this game will shit all over your time and kick you in the ass until your credit card falls out.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Although it has been almost a month since I quit this game, I\\'m going to write this review in the hope that new players will have a basic understanding of what they are about to get themselves into. Not saying that you shouldn\\'t TRY the game (it\\'s free so why wouldn\\'t you), but I hope that by the time you reach the point in the game where you feel like you need to swipe your credit card or start feeling the need to keep playing the game even at the cost of neglecting your real life responsibilities, you\\'ll be able to make an educated decision on whether you want to keep p(l)aying or break yourself out of the vicious cycle that is Lost Ark\\'s gameplay loop.\\n\\nTL;DR Lost Ark is a well-polished game with amazing action combat, fun classes, and stunning visuals. However these pros are only meant to draw players in whereby they will fall prey to the dev team\\'s intentionally predatory pay-to-win mechanics, slog through hours of doing the same repetitive tasks on six or more characters every day, get verbally abused or gatekept by a toxic elitist community, or get randomly banned from the game for no reason. This game is not intended for your average Joe who holds a 9-5 day job and only has 2 hours on average to play games every weekday; it is targeted to either single rich people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to throw truckloads of cash at the game, or single poor people who have no other responsibilities or dependents and can afford to play this game for 16 hours every day.\\n\\nKorean MMOs are notorious for their top tier gameplay, stunning visuals and graphics, punishing amounts of grinding, and pay-to-win mechanics designed on the philosophy that rich people should always dominate poor people in every aspect of life. Lost Ark unfortunately is no exception to this doctrine. As a new player, upon starting the game you will immediately be wowed by the game\\'s fantastic graphics, polished zones, and fun action combat. But don\\'t be fooled; you are the fish that the devs want to catch and the pretty graphics and amazing gameplay is the bait that they use to hook you in. The story of this game is mediocre and is mainly just generic medieval fantasy garbage that you\\'ve likely seen in many previous MMOs or other RPG games. The bad guys of the world are even just generically named as \"demons\". After reading through a few lines of story dialogue you will very soon become lost and confused with regards to where the story is going and eventually you\\'ll just end up skipping the majority of the quest dialogue.\\n\\nThe early game from level 1-50 mostly consists of you following the main story quest while doing countless numbers of generic \"kill X\" or \"fetch X\" side quests. In between there are dungeons that you will both run through as part of the main story or optionally as part of a side quest. These dungeons are well designed, but unfortunately you won\\'t be able to team up with anyone to run them because the early game is completely devoid of real human players. Your only companions at this point are the hundreds of bot trains that run around each zone with impunity.\\n\\nReaching level 50 as a new player will likely take anywhere between 8-40 hours of gameplay, depending on whether you\\'re speedrunning through each zone or taking the time to stop and smell the roses. Once you hit level 50 you\\'ll enter what the game refers to as \"Tier 1\" of progression. There are currently three tiers of progression: 1, 2, and 3 (the current highest tier). This is where you will establish your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark, which will consist of doing your daily two Chaos dungeon runs, daily two Guardian runs, daily three Una\\'s tasks (which are again either \"kill X\" or \"fetch X\" quests), and weekly three Una\\'s tasks (which are again mostly just \"kill X\" or \"fetch X\" except scaled up).\\n\\nThe progression from Tier 1 to Tier 3 has been streamlined since the game release but is still quite a chore to slog through, especially since at this point in the game you are unlikely to have encountered a single human player. Guardian runs are nearly impossible to solo as a new player and will basically be unplayable as there are no human players to run them with. Chaos dungeons are just braindead solo instances where you mash as many buttons as you can to kill as many mobs as possible while picking up loot. You will log in to do your dailies but once your dailies are done, your vertical progression for the day is capped and there is nothing you can do except wait for the next day for your dailies to reset.\\n\\nFor the next 50-100 hours you will slog your way from T1 to T2 and T2 to T3 by doing the same repetitive daily routine of chaos dungeons, fetch quests, and kill quests. The whole time you won\\'t meet a single real human player until you reach T3. But T3 is also where the real grind starts. You thought what you were doing up until this point was repetitive and boring? Nope, you\\'re in for the grind of your life. This is also the point at which the predatory pay-to-win mechanics of this game start to show. Upgrading your gear is RNG-based, and as you go higher not only does the chance of succeeding drop significantly lower, but the cost of each upgrade attempt skyrockets to the point that farming your dailies on a single character will not be enough to make any sort of meaningful progress in a reasonable timeframe. You will have two choices at this point: 1) create alt characters and push them to T3 so you can farm more dailies on each character (daily rewards are per character, not per account) to get more materials to upgrade your main character; OR 2) pull out your credit card. Most players will do a combination of both, resulting in them not only spending an unhealthy number of hours playing the game every day but also an ungodly amount of money on the game just to overcome the artificial barriers put up by the devs preventing you from participating in the best content that Lost Ark has to offer, which is the Legion Raids.\\n\\nBy the time you progress far enough in the game to meet the minimum requirements to run your first legion raid, you\\'ll find that nobody wants to take you because the majority of players in this game are already far ahead of you and don\\'t have the patience to teach you the raids, which are actually quite challenging and require you to fail a few times so you can practice. After all, the players that still play the game at this point are hardcore gamers who have 20+ alt characters that they need to farm dailies on every day, so every minute that they spend teaching you and not farming their alts is a minute where they are not making gold. The barriers to playing the most fun content in this game are so high that it is impossible for anyone to surmount them unless they play with a large dedicated group of friends or are willing to empty their entire bank account.\\n\\nIf you still have not quit the game by now you will most likely be forced to when AGS (the publisher of Lost Ark) permanently bans you for violating their code of conduct. The ban will happen randomly and without warning, your appeal will be automatically denied, and no explanation for the ban will be given. This is because Lost Ark has the worst infestation of bots and RMTers that possibly has ever existed in an MMO up to this point, and AGS is so incompetent that their efforts to lessen the problem have only ended up making things worse. Legitimate and innocent players get banned on a daily basis while blatant RMTers who have been around since the game\\'s launch stream themselves buying out the entire Lost Ark economy in broad daylight and still go unpunished. All of your time, effort, and money invested in the game gone in an instant with no chance to get it back.\\n\\nBy all means, try this game out but don\\'t let it hook you in. It\\'s worth a few hours of your time but nothing more.',\n",

       "  'review': '\\nPros:\\nThe combat in this game is top notch. Its fun, engaging, and there are plenty of classes with very unique gameplay for every gamer. There are plenty of raids (and soon to be more) each being quite different from one another and are challenging. \\n\\nCons: \\n\\nThe downside to the pros is not all classes are released and the publisher/developer decided to slowly release them. Its expected to take almost a year from now to get all the classes currently available in other regions.\\n\\nThe game is addicting. There are dailies and weeklies which pushes players to feel the need to log on. Its not like other games where you can pick up where you left off. You COULD choose to take a break but when you come back you will be time-gated as there are daily/weekly limits to each content. This creates a sense of FOMO and therefore can hook players. \\n\\nThere are a lot of rng in this game. From honing (upgrading) gear to cutting rocks (which provide unique engravings (stats), the disparity between a lucky player and an unlucky player is large. If you were to quantify it in terms of dollars, it would easily be in the thousands. This would be considered a gambling element to this game and therefore to some can be addicting.\\n\\nThere is a huge problem with bots and RMTers, especially on NAW. NAW has queue times at all times of the day but plans have been announced to combat this (who knows if it will be effective). RMTers (people who buy gold illegally, most likely from bots), go un-punished as amazon seems to be turning a blind eye to them. This is unfortunate and unfair to players who either bought gold legitimately in-game or players who no-lifed this game. \\n\\nOverall, I recommend this game as its free to play and you might as well try it out. However, I do think there are more cons than pros to this game currently so it really depends on what you are looking for. These cons are what I find most relevant for myself. The combat and raids are amazing though and is the main reason why I am recommending this as opposed to not recommending it. Hope this was useful~',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve been a fan of Dead Space since before the first title even came out.  I was instantly intrigued by the early trailers and even ended up in the top 10 finalists of the No Known Survivors contest and won a free copy of the game.  I\\'ve counted myself as one of Dead Space\\'s biggest fans ever since and replay the original and Dead Space 2 regularly.\\n\\nFast-forward to now and we have this absolutely stellar remake of the first game.  I have to admit I came into this cautiously optimistic because it would have been easy to miss the mark when remaking a game as legendary as the original Dead Space.  Not to mention the well-known fact that EA botched Dead Space 3 by meddling in its development (injecting microtransactions, coop, and story changes) and set absolutely absurd sales targets which lead to the ruination of Visceral Games.  Knowing that this franchise was still in EA\\'s hands and being developed by an entirely different team was concerning to say the least.  \\n\\nWell.. my concerns are history.  They knocked it out of the park!  Having finished the game at this point I can say that this game stands beside the Resident Evil 2 remake at the absolute pinnacle of video game remakes.  The main and side stories of the game were expanded upon without being drastically altered which serves only to improve them.  Isaac and Nicole\\'s relationship is much more interesting for example, and we get further backstory on characters (and even monsters) that were more of a mystery in the original.  Parts of the original that could get a bit tedious (like the ADS defense segment) were polished and made more enjoyable.  The upgrade tree for weapons is very similar and yet enhanced with new unique special upgrades that make things more interesting.  Additionally the two main companion characters (Hammond and Daniels) are much more interesting and likable in the remake.  I absolutely loved the addition of optional side quests which expand on the story.  This is a clever way to add more lore for those of us that are interested without forcing it on those who are not.  \\n\\nI have to say one of my favorite changes with this remake is the fact that instead of being a chapter-based setup locked behind the tram, this version of the Ishimura is completely open and you can take the tram anywhere and anytime you want.  With the new security clearance system this strongly encourages backtracking when you unlock access to new areas.  I was also very happy to see that the game clearly indicates the \"point of no return\" where you might want to wrap up any side quests before finishing the main story.\\n\\nAll in all, I was absolutely blown away by this remake and I am incredibly hopeful that they will continue with a Dead Space 2 remake of this caliber.  Here\\'s to hoping that Dead Space is finally back!',\n",

       "  'review': 'They have managed to make one of my favorite horror games even better.  This remake is so amazing.  I absolutely love revisiting this game in modern graphics with the added touches they have made.  They took nothing away and stayed true to the original game so far.  This is one of the best games to come out in a long while because not only is it an amazing game, but it runs well and i have not had a single bug or crash.   unlike many games that come out in a poor state these days, this game is absolutely fantastic. 10/10  I missed having games this well made.  welcome back old friend.  Worth every penny paid.',\n",

       "  'review': \"EA Motive's Dead Space Remake is phenomenal. This remake adds extra side missions, stunning visual enhancements, and impressive sound design, providing a true current-gen experience while the core gameplay stays true to the original game. It's a mix of nostalgia and freshness that targets both OG fans and new players. The game provides a jaw-dropping cinematic experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat until it ends. It gave me goosebumps from time to time; it's a next-level immersion. The overall feel of the game is fantastic and it is very well polished at launch, which is very rare these days, so that's a plus. if you're looking forward to purchasing it ? Just don't think much about it; simply purchase the game and enjoy the spine-chilling experience that Dead Space Remake has to offer !!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dead Space(2008) was one of my all time favorite games I ever played back on my Xbox 360. To see it remade is amazing feeling, one that I certainly didn't expect. For myself-and I imagine for everyone who played the Original- It's like coming home after a long time away. More importantly, it lets new players and perhaps even old ones who missed out, enter the wonderfully crafted world of The USG Ishimura. In a sense, remaking a game after all this time for young and old alike to share in. Makes us whole.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dead Space is a classic of the survival horror shooter style games set in a sci-fi universe. Not having played the original, so I will talk about the game itself and not the remake part.\\n\\nThe game will put you on board the USG Ishimura, a surface breaker ship that goes dark after arriving on a distant planet. When you arrive on board, you'll discover different monsters that you'll have to face to survive.\\n\\nWe feel a slight inspiration of resident evil in the gameplay but with many unique and innovative elements. There is an exploration side with a lot of loot to find allowing you to improve your armor and the different weapons you find during your adventure. You will also find different gagdets adding a real dimension to the gameplay. There are also puzzles, some of which will force you to face monsters while solving them which makes these passages terrifying, I hope you are not afraid of the dark...\\n\\nThe game is also very immersive, the audio design is really insane and makes you very paranoid. One of the best things about it is that all of the game's hud are directly embedded in the game, so there is no pause time when you are on your map or in your inventory, you see what your character sees.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique survival horror, as mentioned above, the gameplay is quite rich and innovative, the atmosphere is insane. This game really stands out from its genre and is a must have for any fan of this category.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m amazed by how well they manage to pull this off. It\\'s like the RE1 remake of Dead Space.\\n\\nFirst of all, the game is close to flawless on release, a staggering difference compared to other recent releases. Some people have complained about missing mission objects but I haven\\'t experienced any of that and I tend to break games. There is some stutter when entering rooms. While i hope they can iron it out in time It\\'s nothing close to Stutter Ring or the Stutter Protocol. Shaders are precompiled so that shouldn\\'t be the issue this time around.\\n\\nAll gameplay changes are for the better IMO. You move more like DS2, making you feel more in control. This might remove some of the tension like removing tank controls in RE but I always felt DS1 was a bit sluggish. They have also mitigated that loss of tension with the new \"director\" that can throw encounters at you when you don\\'t expect it. The backtracking and sidemissions add a lot of enjoyment and the world feels a bit more \"alive\". It\\'s just the perfect incapsulation of what it set out to be, RE4 in space (no, you still can\\'t roundhouse kick the necromorphs. you\\'re pretty much an engineer in an old school diving suit).\\n\\nModels have obviously gotten a lot better and some people don\\'t like seeing the wrinkles on Nicole (who is probably the same age as Isaac, 40s) and she is actually pretty if you stop being childish for a moment. You\\'re entitled to your opinion but having a 40yo engineer and a 20yo, well educated and experienced, doctor doesn\\'t make any sense (the people running defence also show their colors saying \"not everyone can look like model\", but she could literally still be a model with her face but she might be a bit short for that vocation). The raytracing also does wonders to the characters faces so turn that on if you can.\\n\\nSome of the story changes are great and add to the atmosphere while others seem silly, they tried to add a bit more depth to a specific character and it fell flat for me. I did play the original and if you didn\\'t you might not feel the same way, the idea itself is somewhat clever.\\n\\nThe same can be said about some other changes you\\'ve probably heard about, they don\\'t necessarily feel natural especially the bathroom one. I just don\\'t see why they would have three figures instead of just the one with halfpants/halfskirt, or just a sign saying bathroom since there are no gendered bathrooms on the ship from what i understand. It feels contrived and unrealistic which might take away from immersion for some people.\\n\\nI\\'ve played through the game once, on NG+ now and still having a lot of fun with the mechanics. Cutting limbs off of necromorphs with an engineers tools somehow never gets old (unlike Nicole amirite huehue).\\n\\nAmazing utilization of Raytracing, my stock settings had it turned off and turning it on was like night and day. I haven\\'t seen many games where it\\'s this prominent.\\n\\nAtmosphere is great with a lot of background noise keeping you on edge, weapons are fun and somewhat diverse (I mostly use the plasma cutter, and the flame thrower for those small creepy crawlies though), upgrade system is enjoyable and pushes you to play ng+ in a good way, the addition of keycards and backtracking gives a lot to the hoarder in me and ofcourse Isaacs iconic suits are just *chefs kiss*.\\n\\nI recommend this with all my heart and will now go and buy the bonus stuff just to show the developers that i love what they\\'re doing and hope to see more in the future.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Awesome remake of the cult classic sci-fi horror game (Dead Space) from 2008. The graphics looks very good and detailed and the sound effects in this game is outstanding. Very creepy to explore the big space ship (USG Ishimura) as a disaster on board the ship has happened. You have several great weapons to handle and upgrade in this alien outbreak. Great monster design and it feels like the cult horror movie (The Thing) from 1982 or the remake of that same movie from 2011. Very disturbing feeling.\\n\\nI played the game on my dated (2016-2017) PC: (Asus, GTX 1070 -GPU, 6700k -CPU, 32GB -RAM, SSD install, Windows 10, ASUS 24\" 144hz monitor @ 1080p)\\n\\n** I played with LOW setting @ 1080p resolution getting 30-50 fps. The game requires a much newer machine to bump up the graphic goodies. \\n\\nGreat work by (EA Motive). This game is an instant buy. I envy you guys who never played (Dead Space) before. This is the version to get no mather the cost..\\n_________\\nScore: 9 of 10',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played all 3 mainline Dead Space games and I can say without hesitation this is the gold standard for any sort of remake. Not only has the graphical fidelity been brought up to modern standards, but many weapons have been tweaked or refined to be much more useful in combating the Necromorph threat. The cherry on top of this layer-cake of gaming goodness is the return of Isaac Clarke's talented voice actor Gunner Wright, who has joined us on our return to the Ishimura to breathe new life into the story by giving a voice to our armor-plated favorite engineer. A must-have for anyone who enjoyed the previous games or enjoys tense survival/action.\",\n",

(I will not apologize for that pun)\\n\\nI'm only within the first 2 hours of this remake though and words really cannot describe the feeling i have, it's like reliving my teen years.\\nThe graphics is gorgeous and the optimization is good on my end at least, i would say this is how most of us remembered DS with the nostalgia glasses on.\\n\\nThe biggest improvement might be the gameplay, combat is so much more fluid while also retaining the feel of the original. \\nThe sound design is also top notch, and the best part for me personally that is: Isaac is voiced now and they brought back Gunner Wright which is a huge pro.\\n(Also most of the original cast is also back, but they were always voiced characters)\\n\\nTo those who never played the original: I envy you guys, you are about to experience one of the greatest survival horror games with a modern coating it deserves.\\n\\nFrom a long time Dead Space fan, thank you for the devs who clearly had passion towards the first game and even EA for reviving this long dead franchise and giving\\nit a shot again. \\n\\nI hope this one sells well and we might get a Dead Space 2 remake too down the line, or even a long overdue sequel to DS3. \\nThis team proven that the IP is in good hands with them.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I love the OG Dead Space so much and hoped I could love the Remake just as much, if not even more, but sadly this isn't the case. The technical state of the game is simply atrocious and the true horror experience I currently have. My RIG is well above the recommended specs (i7-10700KF, RTX3080, 32GB Ram, NVMe SSD) and the game still runs like a turd.\\n\\n- constant smaller frame drops for no reason\\n- DLSS and FSR are both borked (VRS setting you can't turn off which results in muddy/blurry textures)\\n- buggy ragdoll/collision physics (enemies can get stuck easily in tighter spots)\\n\\nAnd I could even live with those problems if it wouldn't be for the major problem I currently have: \\n\\n- after returning to the Kellion - if the game runs for ~5 minutes - cutscenes trigger a bug which locks my FPS around 10-20 regardless of the settings I have until I restart the game making it simply unplayable for me. tabbing out and back in may help some others but it doesn't for me\\n\\nI simply can't recommend the game in its current state. The gameplay and atmosphere are both still great so if the devs fix those problems I will obviously change my review. Until then, it will remain negative.\",\n",

Maybe I change it in the future.\\n\\nThere are 2 problems (at least for me):\\n1. It uses Denuvo DRM and it's not mentioned anywhere on the store page\\n2. Many people have great performance, but sadly, for me, it randomly becomes a slideshow. At pure random, the game runs at framerates from 10-30. Really annoying if this happens in combat. If it stabilizes again, the game runs at a range from 60-90 fps, sometimes with stuttering.\\n\\nMy Hardware should be fine enough to run this game at ultra, please fix it EA! Or remove Denuvo!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Intro[/h1]\\nEven after completing the remake, I still think Dead Space (2008) doesn’t need a remake, as the technology and design of the original are so advanced and future-proof that it is more like a game from 2015. That being said, the remake is a welcome addition – it extends and enhances the original experience, and as a fan, I love seeing the long-waiting return of a dormant franchise.\\n\\n[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]\\nThe atmosphere building is a staple of the franchise, inspiring lots of later horror games. With the smart use of light, shadow, darkness, creepy environmental noise, unsettling background music, claustrophobic environments and jump scare, the OG excels at creating psychological horror – players are so stressed about their surroundings for anything that might come out. The remake not only recreates this essence of the original, with updated visuals and technology, it also makes it better thanks to higher fidelity. For example, due to technology limits, the OG doesn’t have great flicking light effects or completely dark areas, which the later DS2 shows their existence can take the horror atmosphere to another level. The remake makes up for them while looking very good (the OG looks brown like many games at that period).\\n\\nAn issue I have with DS3 and the latter part of DS2 is enemy encounter becomes so frequent that there is no chance of building up atmosphere. The unsettling feelings are gone because players are just busy shooting enemies nonstop, effectively making the game an action shooter. I am glad the dev realized it - or because the OG doesn’t have this problem so it wasn’t inherited by the remake. Anyway, the remake has a good encounter frequency – there is room to build up tension while players won’t feel bored for not having encounter for too long. \\n\\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\\nFor returned players, I think the level design is an even more meaningful change than graphics. I am very happy to revisit familiar levels and iconic locations, as most (or all) levels were retained and rearranged (with new levels added) while undergoing a modern spin to add more playability, such as adding side quests, more zero gravity and vacuum areas and locked rooms can only visit in later process etc. My favorite is the new circuit breaker where players must turn one or another switch on/off, like kill the oxygen or the light. This “pick your poison” mechanic is very brilliant as players must live through the consequences they choose, adding a new layer of stress.\\n\\nThe OG level design is good but suffers from being too linear – levels are divided too distinctively by basically starting from getting off the train and ending in getting on it, making the game kind of predictable. In the remake, levels transit more seamlessly and there is no longer getting on the train and goodbye, as Ishimura is now an open map that players need to traverse back and forth for the story and exploration. \\n\\nI like the idea of exploration, but it is not done good enough. As the story progresses, players acquire different levels of clearance for locked rooms and locked boxes, and a big part of exploration comes from back-tracking to open them. However, because the map system follows the original, it is not good for displaying the multi-layer and more complex map of the remake (OG doesn’t even need to use map). The locator was supposed to be a good solution to this, but for whatever reason, you cannot customize waypoint to the locator. Players are forced to use the map making it a cumbersome experience to explore. \\n\\nOn top of that, the exploration is too dispensable for not being rewarding enough. The most valuable rewards are weapon parts, which unlock more weapon upgrades. But they are not get-and-use, you still need to spend nodes to upgrade, making them much less appealing, not to mention even without them weapons are pretty powerful already even at hard difficulty. The worst part is that side quests (except one) only tell more story background and give some consumables along the way, which come plenty anyway.\\n\\nFor the rest, it is a shame that the game doesn’t improve the control in zero gravity areas as it is still as clumsy and disoriented as before. In these areas, combat is kind of cumbersome as well, since they are often not bright enough but have enemies coming from any direction. \\n\\n[h1]Balance[/h1]\\nWeapon, enemy, inventory all went through rebalancing to overcome some drawbacks of the original. I beat the game at hard difficulty and noticed enemies are slower than OG so that there is enough time for me to rotate over weapons to perform tactics, opening up more possibility for strategy, like I managed to shoot out fire wall with flamethrower to keep enemies in place, cut the limbs off from tougher enemies with plasma cutter and finally blast the rest of them off with contact beam, all of which were done without stasis.\\n\\nEven at hard difficulty, the game is kind of easy, but enemies are definitely more spongy than my liking, which is done for not only strategy but also for balancing supply and weapon. In the old games, I always bring plasma cutter, line gun, pulse rifle because they are good for all circumstances. But in the remake, they receive less ammo drop than they consume (un-upgraded) at hard difficulty. An un-upgraded plasma cutter kills enemy in 8 to 12 shots while it only drops 6 shots for once, so in the first half of my game, my cutter and rifle often had no ammo. Also, if you keep four weapons in inventory, these three tend to get less or no chance of ammo drop. I think it is to balance out them being too powerful (force rifle feels nerfed in actual use), opening more chances for other weapons. I honestly like this change as otherwise I wouldn’t discover the flamethrower has the highest kill-to-ammo consumption ratio among all weapons.\\n\\nOne small problem with trajectory and collision is that sometimes grenades and explosives just go through enemies without hitting them, but it doesn’t affect that much.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nNot much was added to the already abundant space Lovecraftian world setting, and the story changes focus on new characters and some original characters having altered fate and stance, paving the way for sequels. One of the biggest issues I have with the original is the protagonist is a silent tool man, displaying no thoughts and emotion whatsoever and just doing what was asked. In the remake, he is given a proper backstory and character development so that the audience can finally sympathize with him and understand his motive and thoughts that were not clearly told before.\\n\\nIn the original, most storytelling is by conversations while you are busy exploring or even fighting, leading to a hard time focusing on the story. The remake gives proper conversation windows (you aren’t too busy with something else) while keeping it succinct so that the storytelling feels better.\\n\\nAs for the downsides, there are some cringy dialogues, and I don’t think the story goes as naturally as the original. “Make us whole again” is a very memorable line in the original and is presented in very powerful moments, but the remake sort of spams this line everywhere losing its charm and impact. The remake does have a better reunion scene between Isaac and Nicole, with the game suddenly changing from fast to slow and having smooth music amidst the tension, but I still think the original story was presented better and has better writing.\\n\\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\\nI like the OG slightly better in terms of story, and its level design does have its charms. Because the OG is not really outdated, I won’t call the remake a replacement of the original, but rather a new way to experience the classic with a better atmosphere, adjusted balance and modernized level design. It is excellent even with a few minor flaws. I hope EA keeps remaking Dead Space in this style, but surely DS3 will need a big overhaul.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The USG Kellion receives a distress signal from the USG Ishimura, where Isaac Clarke’s girlfriend Nicole is stationed, is how your roughly 12-hour nightmare starts. You don your RIG and reload your plasma cutter as Captain Hammond calls everyone on deck on approach of the massive flagship. Floating in space, the planet cracker thrones over everything surrounding it, a dark grey shape that seems so vast on the outside and so crammed on the inside, truly a monster of steel and glass.\\n\\nInside its dark and filthy guts, almost the entire crew has either been killed or transformed into Necromorphs, twisted, reanimated bodies that want nothing more than to kill you in one of very many, very violent ways. As the infection took everyone by storm, they left behind half-interrupted lives, notes and half-completed jobs, the web of which you will explore through notes, videos and audio logs.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927376329\\n\\nThis entire aesthetic, heavily inspired from early entries into the Alien franchise and heavily reliant on a type of dim, sort of candle-light lighting eerily revealing metallic, industrial textures is so memorable that a well-done remake of Dead Space would not only introduce its engaging world to newcomers and younger generations, but would also reignite interest in the rich extended universe this franchise has to offer (two novels, a bunch of spin-off video games and sequels, a comic book miniseries, two feature animation films, two graphic novels paint a detailed mosaic of the origins of Unitology and the Markers).  \\n\\nWhat is a game made with love? It seems strange to use the term when referring to a video game featuring, but not limited to: body horror, dismemberment, jump scares galore and oceans of blood, but Motive’s remake of 2008’s Dead Space is, without a doubt, a game made with plenty of this ingredient. The devs have a fundamental understanding of everything that worked before and made little clever changes that elevate the already solid structure of an inspired video-game into an even richer experience. For example, power reroutes will have you decide whether you want to traverse a dangerous section without light or oxygen, and the linear tram-based navigation now permits you to revisit any unlocked section of the ship before a point of no return that takes place before the last chapter. The levels have extremely similar layouts to the original but are arranged in a very intuitive way that makes backtracking for sidequests and optional locker rooms very simple and straightforward.\\n\\nOpen spaces are much more interesting than in the original, in no small part because there’s no more zip-based navigation. Wide, crowded hangars now invite you to boost yourself around and loot everything, and there’s even a bossfight in Zero G that makes full use of the free range of movement while floating. Sidequests develop backstories for some of the secondary characters and monsters, and credential-dependant lockboxes can only be opened after the appropriate-level RIG is looted.\\n\\nThe graphics are absolutely spectacular, offering plenty of vistas and eye candy worthy of modern GPUs. The game really shows its strength in the dark, where subtle changes, fog and particles create a deeply unsettling atmosphere and where you can truly feel Isaac’s fear. It’s a pity, however, that the game doesn’t use modern ray-tracing capabilities to show Isaac’s reflection in mirrors, which could really enhance his growing insanity under the Marker’s influence. Speaking of Isaac, he’s no longer the Gordon Freemanesque mute in the original, having an entire personality and a much angrier attitude towards Unitologists. There are some other minor changes, gender flips and race swaps and more heroic and dramatic deaths, but the ensemble has the same players and follows the same patterns.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927375738\\n\\nDead Space’s sound design also deserves special mention, not only because of the unsettling score, layered noises and clean blending of themes, but especially because of the convincing way sound behaves in a vacuum and the spatial design that enables you to quickly assess all dangers.\\n\\n \\tWhile retaining the spirit, narrative beats and most mechanics of the original, 2023’s Dead Space manages to improve upon numerous aspects and provide a clean, streamlined and well-optimized thrill ride out of the box. Its iconic and immersive game design sports the same diegetic UI, and the weapons and mechanics are for the most part the same as they were fifteen years ago, with a few different alternate fires and improved Zero G navigation, similar to the one in Dead Space 2.\\n\\n\\tAs in any other game in this franchise, limb-chopping will be your bread and butter when it comes to dispatching the monstrous Necromorphs, with an updated system that allows peeling, where you weaken limbs but do not cut through them. I feel the remake is more demanding in terms of precision and angles, where accuracy will save you a ton of ammo and weapons are more evenly balanced. \\n\\n\\tYou spend credits to buy medpacks, ammo and suit upgrades (with the addition of weapon upgrades that unlock greyed out nodes in the bench tree), and one of the most satisfying progression feelings as your suit gradually becomes more elaborate and advanced. The Contact Beam and Force Gun were my two favourite weapons in terms of punchiness, but the numerous upgrades, special passives given by unlockable upgrade slots and a fistful of Nodes will turn any gun into a powerhouse. Stasis and Kinesis remain priceless in the array of gauntlet events, ambushes and bossfights you will have to traverse.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927376148\\n\\n\\tYou can get most collectibles and upgrades within a single playthrough, but if you’re wondering about replayability features there’s the obligatory New Game+ (and the final suit can only be purchased on your second run) and if you’re feeling particularly ironman-y there’s Impossible mode, where you only get one save slot, a single life and the option to continue on Hard difficulty if you die. Beating the game on its hardest difficulty unlocks not only a special skin but also the Foam Finger thing from Dead Space 2. There’s even an alternate ending you can only see if you find all the Marker fragments hidden in New Game Plus runs, so there’s more than one reason to complete Dead Space more than once.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhether you’re a fan of the original or simply a survivor horror enthusiast who never got around to checking this franchise out, Dead Space (2023) can be worthy of your time, provided you aren't deterred by the expensive entry price.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'TL;DR Some improvements in the gameplay department, make it feel like a \"modern game\" however, steps back in the atmosphere department which overall makes the original a better experience. \\n\\nNo this isn\\'t a negative review focusing on the optimization issues. No this isn\\'t a negative review on Denuvo, this is negative review of the remake. I\\'ve seen a lot of positive reviews praising how this game is a better experience in every way to the original, though I don\\'t concur with that statement. Of course graphically, it is better in every way, and there are some game play improvements. I\\'d like to add that in preparation for this remake, I\\'ve played the original just a week before release and thus I think the comparisons I make below are fair considering I have both games fresh in memory.\\n\\nOf the top of my head, I like the new node system (in which it locks you out of future node slots initially). Furthermore, finding weapons instead of buying them has better encouraged me to use other weapons besides just sticking with the plasma cutter. This in conjunction with the game giving more varied ammo, forces you to use more varied guns. Zero Gravity gameplay is also changed to DS2 mechanics, which is for the better. Another improvement that I can think of is the power management system, which in some sections makes you choose cutting out power or air, which add some variety. Furthermore, the removal of loading times making it one seamless experience, and lastly the AI director for spawning enemies. Regarding enemies themselves, in the original, enemies would essentially stagger everytime they were shot, in the remake, enemies dont stagger pretty much at all, which makes things much more intense as you have less time to before they come at you. Overall there are some minor improvements which can make the game play more enjoyable. \\n\\nWhile there are more improvements that I have not listed, those are the ones I can think of the top of my head, of which most are in the graphical and game play department. Where the most of the negative aspect of this review comes down to main reason why everyone loves dead space, the atmosphere. The remake is significantly reduced in this department. While there\\'s no denying you are stuck on a spaceship alone in the middle of nowhere, the remake is almost worse in every aspect and not that close to the original in regards to making a survival horror experience. What I\\'ll list below are very slight changes that may seem insignificant, but on aggregate, really take away from the atmosphere.\\nStory - For one, while the remake does include more background story, it kills the mystery of what is going on in the ishimura, the VERY FIRST data board you read mentions the untiology and paints them in a bad picture right away, and soon enough you learn about the marker. While this information was fed at about the same rate as the original, in the original, we we\\'re left wondering what the unitology was and where these aliens came from, etc, compared this to the remake which gives way too much info too early. \\nMusic - Another big change is the inclusion music in some sections where it doesn\\'t need to be. Of the top of my head, when flying in space in zero-g they\\'ve added some background music which slightly reminds you are just playing a game. The original had no music, and all you could hear was the muffled sounds of footsteps and isaac\\'s breathing/choking as he started to run out of air. I\\'ve also noticed this music addition in some sections without zero-g, where I think switching the music with more atmospheric diegetic sounds would fair better.\\nSound - Honestly, the sound is great in most parts, as they just took the one from the original, but some areas such as the head banging scene and the introduction scene to the baby necromorphs were much more visceral in the original, the original was more powerful sounding, while in the latter, the terror in the guys voice was much more present.\\nAnimation - Again, animation so far is overall better, or the same. Yet a minor detail is isaac\\'s movement, in the original, his movement and stance were visually much more careful and tense whereas remake is less. This extend to running as well, in zero-g, running looked more hefty and had more weight to it, which really drives home the idea that you are this one man against the elements of space in this bulky hard to maneuver piece of equipment.\\nOverall Direction? - I guess the main point i\\'m coming down here is that the game feels like its pandering more to you the player which once again detracts it from reaching that realistic atmosphere the original achieved so well. It feels like a present day dramatized piece of media, whereas the original feels like a more realistic representation of what would happen and while it still panders to the player, the remake does so more. I\\'m quickly reminded of the intro where you get this gore filled stabbing of your crew mate all the while being shoved onto the window, compared  the original where its just him being stabbed. Another example being  or the cinematic introduction of the necromoorph that transforms dead bodies instead of watching it helplessly. \\n\\n(Spoiler ahead regarding one scene)\\nOr how about when Doctor Mercy puts stasis on you, I loved the idea and thought it really added to the experience, however the stasis actually freezes you, which would contradict that our stasis merely slows down things. It also just so happens you are in stasis for the right amount of time Dr. Mercer can monologue and leave. Wouldn\\'t it have been great if perhaps they could make you move while in stasis, and mercer takes your gun and walks around so you cant do anything but slowly chase after him. \\n(Spoiler end) \\n\\nOverall, the modernization makes it feel less unique... less dead space? I\\'m not sure what to call it, but if you play both games, I\\'m almost certain the original Dead Space will feel much more like a unique game rather than the remake which feels like a modern title.\\n\\nPerhaps i\\'m too harsh on the game, given that I\\'m making a lot of nitpicks. Overtime, as I put more runs into the game, my perspective may change. Though the game is a well done re-imagining, and certainly, if this game were released today as a new IP, I would love it more. However, the original does exist and there\\'s a reason its one of the greatest games of all time, which is why I nitpick. My point of contention focuses on the survival horror experience, which does not stand on par to the original Dead Space.\\n\\nReview was updated to fix typos and flow* and added the Spoiler example',\n",

       "  'review': \"I see a lot of people online praising the Remake so much and some people even saying how it does everything better than the original. I think the remake is mediocre, especially for an AAA title.\\n\\nThe animations look wonky. Some people like me were complaining about it before the game got released. They didn't manage to fix them and suddenly everyone doesn't care that they look straight up ridiculous? The moving, the stomp, the punching animations, etc. I managed to avoid being grabbed by necros in my first playthrough so I watched some of the death animations on YouTube. The moment Isaac gets grabbed the camera suddenly changes. It's really bad, I have no idea how people can praise this so much. In the original when you had to to face the drag tentacle, you could move freely while it pops up before it finally grabs you by the ankle. In the remake, your character completely stops and waits to get grabbed. It feels a bit disrespectful as the original creator of the game said that it was a huge issue for them but they managed to nail it. The remake devs just avoided the problem entirely.\\n\\nVoice acting is better in the original than in the remake. I like the original characters way better too. I didn't like how they also changed some of the story and added unskippable cutscenes that take controls of your character so you're forced to sit and watch. The cutscenes also hinder replayability greatly. That part where Isaac's with Johnston or Hammond and before he can move he slowly stays still in one spot and removes his helmet from his head, making you walk slowly, unable to sprint or do anything until the dialogue finishes, only for Isaac to slowly put it back up 30 seconds later? Yeah, that too.\\n\\nThe game also has some performance issues reported by many people on good gaming rigs like constant stuttering and input delay. I have an RTX 3070. While I did manage to play on 140ish (it can go way lower on some parts) FPS at 1080P, I did experience constant stuttering as well as input delay on the weapons. I also crashed thanks to a forced patch while I was half way through playing on Impossible without saving once, so when I booted up I started from the very beginning without any weapons. I kept playing a day later, this timesaving from time to time. Managed to get an infinite loading screen 2 times randomly so I had to forcefully close the game and revert a bit.\\n\\nThe combat loop is better than the original and you can no longer stun lock necros with your weapons, however they screwed up the kinesis. They are times where I wanted to pick up objects right infront of me and the game for some reason would not let me. That includes the dead necromorhph's blades or stasis/explosive canisters. I would try to grab them, but I would get some other object instead way off where I aimed or I would get some necro body I killed earlier. Also the fact that no one can really run this game at really high fps like +200 or 300, making aiming a bit sloppy. I've played FPS games semi competitively and playing on lower fps I can really feel the difference in the mouse feel. I'm not sure how to explain it properly but I feel like people who've also play FPS especially on low sensitivity would understand. Though it's not really a thing that the devs can do much besides optimizing the game better as the graphics are good. Maybe soon we'll get an overpriced GPU that can run games like this on +200 fps on low. Who knows.\\n\\nIt's an alright game but the original does everything besides graphics way better. If you're gonna get it, I suggest you wait for a sale. Also don't get the DLC. The suits are straight up just reskins that do nothing. I only equipped them once to see them.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"As of February 5, 2023, I cannot recommend buying this game on PC-- this is subject to change pending the devs fixing the widespread framerate drops/stuttering issues that seem to plague the title. \\n\\nIN GENERAL: The game is phenomenal across both my Steam Deck and my desktop. It's a straight upgrade over the original, taking everything good about the OG Dead Space and improving it. \\n\\nHOWEVER: whether it be related to the invasive Denuvo DRM that EA has deemed this title to be saddled with, or some texture streaming issue, this game has serious frame drop and traversal stutter problems. In certain segments, my desktop rig (a 3070/9600k build) drops from just over 80fps at 4K down to lower than 30 fps (as low as 10, as I've recorded). These low framerates will continue even into menus. This is a widely reported issue that has yet to be fixed, and does not occur on console versions of the game.\\n\\nThe drops have outright ruined entire setpieces, made combat frustratingly difficult, and come at unexpected times. You can be moving along at 120fps in a complex environment with plenty of particle effects and lighting details, only to have a low-detail room tank the game down to 20fps. The drops and stuttering also occur on the Steam Deck, but are less severe (it's less noticeable to go from 45fps down to 25 than it is from 120 to 30).\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Another solid remake to add to the collection. Pretty faithful to the original while bringing graphics, controls, and compatibility up to modern standards. No Origin/EA launchers, no MTX so far - just some \"Deluxe Edition\" skins. (Fine as long as there\\'s no nagging for purchases in-game.)\\n\\nOnly major concern right now is performance, as the game basically requires DLSS or FSR to get anything playable. I would have expected much higher FPS considering how small and segmented most areas are. Some minor bugs and QoL concerns. PC controls are well mapped by default and supports multiple binds. There are some menus (store, inventory) that require the use of the keyboard (Q, E, space, arrow keys) to navigate, even when the player is immobile and should be able to use the mouse instead. Ultrawide is supported at launch (finally!) Steam deck is supported, but performance is not what I would call \"playable\" (minute long stutters, can\\'t hold 40fps, muddy visuals).\\n\\nI would consider this the definitive edition for anyone who hasn\\'t played the original, and I\\'d consider it a worthwhile upgrade for those who have.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]NOT TRASH.[/h1]\\n\\nIn [b]Dead Space[/b], you are Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent on a repair mission to USG Ishimura, a gigantic spaceship that also seems to have lost contact with the rest of their mission. But you quickly realise this will not be your regular run-of-the-mill task as you discover that the entire vessel seems deserted, bodies have risen with blades for arms, they’re spewing acid, want you dead, and oh, the church is also involved?\\n\\n[table]\\n[tr]\\n[th]🟩 Pros[/th]\\n[th]🟥 Cons[/th][/tr]\\n[td]\\nAmbience\\nIt will make you anxious\\nSatisfying encounters\\n[/td]\\n[td]Some mechanics did not age too well.[/td][/table]\\n\\n[h1] is Dead Space a good remake?[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Dead Space[/b] is a third-person shooter horror game with gloomy corners, little to no lights, and metallic hallways that could potentially hide a monster at every step. The atmosphere is frightening, and your only mean of survival is to dismember your enemies.\\n\\nWe can also start by praising the development team for what seems to be an impossible feat lately. A game was released and was functional and optimised adequately on Day 1. Throughout my gameplay (so far), I never encountered a single frame drop or a loading screen. The transition in action is seamless.\\n\\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics have been refreshed and are adding a whole new spin on Dead Space; the Telekinesis and Stasis are getting some significant improvement and proper tools in your arsenal; you are not confined to one way of playing the game, even though nothing will separate me from my plasma cutter. Each gun is enjoyable to handle and provides a unique way to use it, depending on the situation. The difficulty levels are significant in HARD and above and seem just enough for Normal. The completionists will have a solid task ahead to complete the game without dying once. Finally, maybe it was the force of habit, but it took me a minute to remember that there is no dodge button, loyal to the original gameplay and reminding you that it has been 15 years. Furthermore, replayability is essential nowadays; Dead Space offer the possibility to play in New Game +. \\n\\nThe ambience is superb. Dead Space truly shines in the inclusion of modern graphics in the game, the metallic hallways, every dark corner, flickering lights, and the anxiety of an incoming jump scare. Every little detail has been used to put you in the universe of Isaac and make you feel like part of his adventure. The sound design is crucial in the game as it alerts you of enemies you haven't seen yet (looking at you child-monsters-on-walls); the engine noises, the random screams, sobs, and voices are developing more anxiety than having to host my wife's family over for the holidays. The music also goes along the situation; you forget it's here, but it switches between light tension, full-blown heart attack and deafening silence, which makes your heart race. Finally, different collectables offer tidbits of information, lore and audio logs; all add just enough to the general theme without being a chore to find or essential to the game.\\n\\nThe story did not change from the original, except that you are now part of it. Isaac Clarke has lines which contribute a lot more to the immersion. This is probably the weakest part of this remake as it remained untouched primarily, without being a negative in itself due to it staying loyal to the original content. The addition of different dialogues, lines and other elements was welcome.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924637819\\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\nIt is now time to answer the original question: [b]yes[/b]. I think this remake performs better than its predecessor in many aspects.\\n\\nDead Space stayed faithful to the original game of 15 years ago; purists should not feel concerned. Dead Space kept the same gameplay ideas and mechanics from then and improved on them a little bit. What sets this remake apart from the rest is that a whole new generation of players that can't build up on nostalgia will be able to explore the franchise in a modern setting. The graphical facelift is superb, on par with modern technology, and all the added extra details contribute significantly to the general ambience and atmosphere of the game.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924932920\\n\\n[h1] Let's connect [/h1]\\nIf you liked this review, you can check my curating page for other games you may like.\\n[quote]• [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33562948/]Curating Page[/url]\\n• [url=https://discord.gg/U5Katayh6v]You can also join the Discussion on the Trash Can Discord server [/url][/quote]\",\n",

       "  'review': \"An awesome Remake from all sides; Graphics, Sounds, and Lore. I know the devs said that they were inspired by Capcom and it's RE2 but if you ask me, they took a lot of page from RE1 Remake when it comes to Lore. They managed to keep the story intact while adding new story details and even new plot twists. I believe it would even be enough for some people to check out DS2 and even 3 after they finished playing the game.\\n\\nNO CUT CONTENT. This is a 100% faithful Remake in my opinion.\\n\\na solid 9/10. There are some minor memory leaks that I experienced but a load game should fix that but would appreciate it if you can patch this technical issue in the future.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Коротко о главном[/h1]\\n\\nЭто именно то, чего ожидаешь от крупных компаний, когда они делают одиночную, сюжетно ориентированную игру, а не вот эти вот новомодные и жутко популярные (нет) асинхронно-мультиплеерные др0чильни типа Division'а или GTA Online или вроде того.\\n\\nСюжет полностью повторяет оригинальную часть игры, но с небольшими изменениями в плане нарратива, некоторые вещи преподносятся в ином контексте/в иной ситуации, конкретно про Юнитологов рассказано больше, чем в оригинале.\\n\\nЛокации переработаны, расширили элементы бэктрекинга, теперь на начальных локациях больше всяких дверей и ящиков, требующих определенный уровень доступа, который будет расширятся походу игры, так что имеет смысл пробегаться по старым локациям если хочется за 1 заход получить максимальный профит.\\n\\nГрафона навалили от души, технологии дали дизайнерам возможность в игру света, текстурки сами по себе не очень высокого разрешения, но материалы настроены грамотно, так что если не лезть в экран с лупой, игра выглядит очень сносно и любой закоулок хоть на обои ставь.\\n\\nКроме этого игра богата и на фан-сервис. Есть мелкие отсылки, сюжетные тонкости, рофляные сеты, пистолет в виде перчатки одевающейся на руку которая вантапает практически все живое. Ну вот прям как в RE2 когда давали задержаться в игре подольше ввиду того что есть разного рода мелкий контент.\\n\\n[h1]Не обошлось без дёгтя в бочке с мёдом[/h1]\\n\\n[i]Небольшая ремарка. Следует понимать что это ремейк/ремастер, называйте как хотите, оригинала из 2008 года, где уже все было придумано людьми, которые умели делать игры, интересные игры, с уникальным сеттингом, граммотно сочетать различные фишки. Улучшить что-то - много мозгов не надо, а вот сделать с нуля - тут уже не каждый может. Напоминаю что те же Hangar 13 сделали на 146% провальную Mafia 3, но так же сделали успешный ремейк Mafia 1. Я очень сомневаюсь, что у разработчиков получилось бы годное продолжение или новая IP[/i]\\n\\nПоговорим и о минусах тоже.\\n\\n• Графика и оптимизация: \\nВ игре применен Z-буффер в половину разрешения, так что screen-space шейдеры артефачат в 1080p. Не сказать что это большая проблема, скорее сделано с учетом 4к-экранов, где данных больше, плотность пикселей больше, и эти артефакты уже не так лезут в экран, но тем не менее. Казалось бы, есть FSR/DLSS, включаешь 4к + DLSS и пошло поехало, но не тут-то было. Что FSR что DLSS выглядят в игре абсолютно одинаково, вот абсолютно. Сравнение face-to-face отличить просто невозможно. При этом в обоих случаях убивается детализация текстур. Как это возможно? А вот все дело как раз в обрезанном Z-буфере, причем даже 4к не спасает, игра под DLSS в 4к выглядит хуже чем 1080p без DLSS. А еще игра умудряется статтерить каждый раз, когда прогружает очередной чанк уровня. И это с SSD то. Похоже что статтеры это бич игр 2023 года, что ни запустишь всё везде статтерит. И нет, дело не в моём риге, там все настроено и выпердоленно пуще некуда и на сколько позволяет железо. Не могу сказать что это прям большая проблема, с учетом темпа игры, но подбешивать может. По части графической оптимизации игра чуть выше среднего уровня. Да, фпс достаточно высок, но если фпс высокий, это еще не означает хорошую оптимизацию. Уровни в игре кишкообразные, открытого мира тут нет, рисовать дальше 10 метров не приходится, и очевидно что у игры есть Occlusion Culling (не рендерит то, чего не видно в кадре), при этом же еще можно заметить, особенно в больших комнатах, как прогружаются тени и объекты, и на RTX 3080 без DLSS в 1080p на ультрах без RTAO, игра выдает в районе 110 фпс прыгая в диапазоне от 85 до 150. Я бы не сказал что это хороший фпс при имеющихся условиях. Треугольников на экране не так много, дроу-колов тоже, игра на глазах грузит объекты, так что вместо 110 фпс должно быть 200-300, чтобы сказать что тут прекрасная оптимизация. Тот же RDR2 в открытых пространствах выдает почти тот же фрейм-рейт. RE2 на 1070 при тех же вводных данных что и у Dead Space (2023) вываливала на экран такой же фпс, только GPU был в 3 раза слабее. Ну в общем, оптимизация нормальная, если можно так выразиться, видели мы и хуже, но и стремиться есть куда. Если коротко то скажу что она лучше, чем в большинстве подобных проектов.\\n\\n• Звук и баланс: \\nЗвуки хорошие, не пожатые сэимплы, как в играх Sony, но не могу сказать что игра может похвастаться каким-то 3D-аудио, реверберацией, трассировкой звука [i](кстати тут она бы была п**дец как к месту)[/i], или высоким динамическим диапазоном. Звук здесь не более чем стандартный, ничего выдающегося, есть поддержка Dolby Access. \\nОднако и тут есть пара нюансов: уровни жестко поделены на секции, иногда можно услышать звук какой-нибудь хлопающей двери чуть ли не по всей локации, но стоит выйти за дверь соседней локации, которая еще открыта, как звук тут же пропадает - недоработка движка. Еще я скажу что музыка, которая проигрывается при виде каждого слабого или рядового моба который даже не стал для тебя скримером, в виде крипового оркестрового звучания в мажорных тонах неистово льётся тебе в уши, абсолютно каждый раз, заставляя чувствовать себя некомфортно, терять ориентацию, паниковать, мешает слушать подкрадывающихся сзади других врагов, и в целом раздражает. Быть может так и задумано, но я не вижу в этом никакого прикола, это просто бездарная работа, на мой взгляд, и так делать нельзя. Благо громкость музыки можно снизить или вообще вырубить. Забавно, что все вышеописанные проблемы по звуку, на прочь отсутствуют в ремейке Resident Evil 2, и там работа со звуком проделана на 2 головы выше.\\n\\n• Общие баги: \\nНа момент написания обзора, мной был замечено несколько багов/недочетов, которые скорее всего вытекают из движка игры, вкупе с их ИИ, которым они хвалились, который якобы высчитывает нервозность игрока и делает ему подставы. Был баг со звуком, забагался какой-то скрипучий семпл, похожий на белый шум с овердрайвом, и проигрывался до тех пор, пока я не перезагрузил сейв, при этом было не понятно это так задумано или что, он при этом перебивал музыку (её вообще не было в файтах). Несколько раз встречал баги с амбиентом в помещениях, проигрывался семпл какого-то стука в комнате, который не должен был и которого там не было ранее, при этом пропадали выходя за дверь комнаты, комната метр на метр, а за ее пределами есть несколько уровней корридоров, и этот звук был исключительно в этой комнате - что это было я так и не понял [i](как говорится не баг а фича)[/i]. Так же, при очередном перезаходе в игру, в одной из комнат образовался туман, которго там не было ранее, который просто пропадал если выйти за дверь, и смотреть на открытую дверь и отходить назад. Пару раз игра вылетала [i](просто закрывалась)[/i] без каких-либо ошибок в логах винды или диалоговых окон.\\n\\nВспоминая ремарку выше, оценить этот продукт можно с двух сторон:\\n\\nDS (2008) не существовало, и в таком случае, данный продукт можно рассматривать к покупке за полную цену. Она сочетает в себе элементы RE 2, имеет уникальный сеттинг, сюжет, современную графику, и в целом прикопаться особо не к чему, особенно если опираться на релизы других студий, который не имеют даже этого, а все то что имеют реализовано более скудно. И с такой точки зрения игра 8/10, могла бы получить 8.5/10 если б не имела багов, и лучшую проработку звука.\\n\\nDS (2008) существовал, а DS (2023) это глобальный мод, и в таком случае я не могу рекомендовать к покупке данный продукт за полную стоимость. Как минимум можно подождать патчей, доработок, скидок, а если еще и брать во внимание что это продукт - попытка навариться на чужих наработках 2008 года, и сделать себе репутацию за чужой счет, то только за 1500-2000 рублей и то 10 раз подумать, плюсы хоть и превалируют над минусами, но сами смотрите.\\n\\nИ вот как оценивать данный продукт - не понятно. Хочется похвалить разработчиков за хорошую игру и проделанную работу, но зная что это всего-лишь ремейк, и по факту игра вообще не ими сделана, да еще и косячки есть, я, к сожалению, не могу сказать что они этого заслуживают в полной мере.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Great casual card game especially for minor breaks.\\n\\n[b]Contra:[/b]\\n- 0% Agency over the collection progress.\\n- Collection management and ui have some issues.\\n- No unranked mode. Only way to play is pvp vs other players.\\n- From Rank 0-30 you face nearly no human players.\\n- The game tries to hide if you are playing vs bots. A few clues are bots don't emote and many humans use season locked avatars which the bots don't use.\\n\\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\\n- Deck building is on the simpler side\\n\\n[b]Pro:[/b]\\n- Super short match time (2-4 Minutes). No mulligan, conceding is encouraged (you lose less ELO points) if one party is losing.\\n- Very strategic gameplay. You often you need to anticipate how the opponent will play their cards.\\n- Moneywise the fairest CCG I have played. All non season content can be unlocked for free. A full collection is very viable as 100% F2P player. For a minor competitive advantage you would need to buy a season path each month for 10 bucks each so 120 bucks per year - which is not even 50% of a single hearthstone expansion.\\n[b]Devs officially stated there won't be additional monetisation in the future.[/b]\\n- It's easy to mix up decks by switching a couple of cards. Encourages experimentation.\\n- It's easy to try out new builds because you don't work toward new decks.\\n- Locations often mess things up so you need to spontaneously come up with solutions to make the best with what you are offered.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] 8.5/10 [/h1]\\n\\nAfter a simple trial of this game, I am convinced that this card game with great potential is indeed worthy of the honor of TGA Best Mobile Game in 2022. The developer of the game, Ben Brode, is also the lead designer of the famous card game Hearthstone, so players don't need to worry about the quality of the game at all.\\n\\nThe well-known Marvel universe characters make the players feel very friendly. The easy-to-understand, easy-to-learn, and high-limit game design make the players not need to spend too much time on game learning, and the unique design of the location makes each game unique to a certain extent. At the same time, the very short single game time and the game's unique Snap system make this game very interesting and addictive. Your game in this game is not only about the cards and winning or losing in a single round, the controllable odds also allow players who are good at calculation to maximize their income.\\n\\nOf course, such a good Marvel Snap isn't without its flaws. In this game, you can get cards only by constantly upgrading the collection level instead of purchasing packs. It is precisely for this reason that the game has added the setting of Card Pools. This is certainly an excellent design, but the credits required for upgrading are a very scarce resource in the game, and you must play for a long time to continuously obtain them, or pay to reduce the time to get the card. The cards obtained when upgrading the collection level are also relatively random, players who enter Pool 2 and Pool 3 for the first time often have a very bad game experience because of the cards that have not yet been obtained. In addition, too expensive in-game purchases are also factors that have been criticized by players. Too simple a game interface, a bad game server, and no friend system also ruined the game experience to a certain extent, but it is understandable as a game in the EA stage.\\n\\nAll in all, Marvel Snap is a card game well worth playing. It has worked hard to achieve long-term Customer Stickiness, so for those looking for a card game that can be played for a long time, this may be an excellent choice. Fans of the Marvel universe and card game lovers should not miss it, you can try it before deciding whether to play for a long time.\",\n",

Play is quick and punchy, card powers are simple but compelling, the field division into three locations leads to interesting combos and mind games that wouldn\\'t exist on a uniform board, collection upgrading is addictive (\"frame break!\"), the music is a clew of earworms, and the game as a whole feels more approachable and less burdensome than competitors owing to brief matches and small decks.\\n\\nI used to play Hearthstone (really, aside from scant single-player adventures, I would just log in and make a ranking push each month for the card back even though I usually didn\\'t feel like it), and putting a deck together was a massive slog because, with 30 cards per deck and a huge catalog of possibilities, flipping through all those pages to consider the often redundant options for so many positions along the curve made holding a strategic picture in mind daunting at best—and attempting to optimize it without copying a pre-made from some website nearly impossible.  This isn\\'t the case in Snap, where most cards seem distinct, each of the six turns represents a clear step in your tactical plan, and every space in your deck feels important.  It could well be that players who\\'ve dipped into several pools are seeing a more bloated game by now, but at my level this is pretty tight.  Every card has something to offer, with the exception of the few throwaway starter cards that don\\'t bring any actual abilities to the board (and there are ways to mess around with even those).\\n\\nAnd collecting those cards is fun in its own right.  Seeing friends share images of their broad rosters of diverse characters was a big part of Snap\\'s draw for me, especially with some of the fun and sometimes bizarro variant art available for them.  Every character has their own unique logo design, and seeing them all assembled in a big set is naturally pleasurable.  Abilities usually make a good logical match to the character themselves, and cards further express that character through unique visual effects both on play and on ability activation.  The game just does an excellent job overall of harnessing the immense and colorful stable of characters that Marvel has to offer.  I mentioned the card upgrades earlier, but it bears repeating that this sense that you\\'re investing in cards or variants that you often play with or think are cool by upgrading their art is a very smart addition to the collectable card game format.  If you\\'ve got a favorite, giving it 3D layering or animated elements just feels great.  More than in many similar games, there\\'s a powerful physicality in the cards you collect, and you come to feel like they actually belong to you.\\n\\nHonestly, writing this review is dangerous.  I can feel the pull to get back in there, but I\\'m resisting because, as enjoyable as Snap is just to play, I can\\'t do it casually.  Everything about its structure is designed to draw commitment from you through collection levels, a risk/reward rank ladder, and daily/weekly/monthly missions feeding season pass rewards.  Maybe I\\'ve just been beaten down by the industry to the point where I cynically expect this stuff rather than resent its manipulation as strongly as I should, but either way the simple truth is that I don\\'t have room in my life for another game that wants to make me play it all of the time.\\n\\nI look at Marvel Snap and extrapolate the progression I\\'ve experienced so far to ask: What would I actually get out of investing in this for months of regular—frequent, even!—play?  This is obviously personal, but because it\\'s a competitive game the answer for me is very little.  There\\'s no content to conquer.  There\\'s no puzzle to solve.  There\\'s no end point.  It\\'s just about continuously being better than other players, grinding along infinite progression tracks, and acquiring more cards and cosmetic collectables.  I don\\'t deny that there\\'s satisfaction in a win, but competitive victories never last.  Beating other players isn\\'t really meaningful or attractive to me enough on its own.  So I have made the adult decision to not get sucked into this, because I know that, eventually, it will leave me feeling hollow.\\n\\nAnd maybe it wasn\\'t all that hard for me, after all; I just needed a single day off to remember how nice it felt not to be constantly compelled to keep up.  I indulge enough games like that already, believe me.  No matter how shiny, another can\\'t be good for my mental health.',\n",

       "  'review': \"A card game where you can't buy booster packs? What sorcery is this?\\nBen Brode is behind this, which was the game director in early days of Hearthstone.\\nSuper fast, fun and easy to learn with some strategy involved. Cool Snap mechanic, where you basically gamble to double your progress in rank if you win or lose that much if you lose (something like poker, you can bluff you have a good hand).\\nYou unlock more cards just by playing and upgrading visually your current ones. This motivates you to play with different cards just to upgrade them which leads to some cool variety decks.\\nYou can buy card variants with money from the shop which is just different art for you current cards and credits which let's you upgrade cards more often. Personally i believe the daily and weekly rewards along with free rewards from season pass are enough to keep you going. Some people might want to get every single card in the game asap then you gotta pay. \\nYou only face opponents in your current unlock state though called card pool so you don't feel overwhelmed as a free to play player.\\nI highly recommend this if you like card games or even if you are just a marvel fan.\\nSome missing features and some problems with UI here and there but it's stll early access, nothing that can't be fixed.\\nGive it a try and see for yourself, just don't forget to link your steam account with an email even if you don't play on mobile cause you lose your progress if something happens with your game files.\\n\\nHappy Snapping!\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I really wanted to leave a positive review, but I just couldn\\'t. The game offers a lot of fun, but it is just a mobile game in the end - with a classic \"bait and switch\" hiding predatory monetization, which I do not intend to buy into.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\\nI love everything about the game itself and the card mechanics. The location system makes every match unique, and even though sometimes you just get screwed by the rng, you can just Retreat and go on to the next match. Every match has a set turn count of 6, and both players plays their cards at once, which makes every game just a few minutes long.\\nThe devs also made the ranked system into part of the actual gameplay. You play for Cubes which are basically points you rank up with, and you can double the bet of cubes for the next turn (called Snapping) once per game when you think you are winning. The opponent can also do that, and it also doubles automatically on the last turn. So the Cube payout can be 1, 2, 4 or 8. This system makes Retreating a match a good strategic option, but the drawback of it is that you often don\\'t see how a game would have turned out on the last turn, which is less fun, and also makes learning the game harder.\\n\\n[h1]Bots[/h1]\\nWhen you queue up, there\\'s a high chance you will be playing against a bot. When I first started playing I had to play against bots exclusively for like 6+ hours, until I finally started noticing human players. If you know about their existence, it\\'s quite easy to spot them though, they have simple names, don\\'t emote, and do really bad plays. They serve their purpose as a tutorial I guess, but they just keep showing up. My problem with them is when your opponent does questionable plays you will start wondering if they are bots or not. It also makes me feel like I wasted my time on a free win. I don\\'t know why, but it seems like everyone is fine with bots, and acts like they are a natural part of the game. For me it comes off as disingenuous and a way to make unaware players feel good. And it\\'s not like there wouldn\\'t be any real players to match with, you get matched with these bots after just 2 seconds of \"searching\".\\n\\n[h1]Card acquisition and monetization[/h1]\\nThis game uses a (basically infinitely long) Pass system for obtaining new cards. You can earn resources from games and daily missions and use those to upgrade the looks of your card. This process also gives you Collection Levels (CL). At first it works fine, you will get Cards very often. Early cards have simple abilities which teaches you the basics, and looks like a nicely designed progression system. As of writing this, there are five pools (series) of cards you can obtain cards from. First you will only obtain cards from Series 1, which are the simpler card designs. After that, progression will slow down just a little bit, while you are obtaining cards from Series 2, but you will still steadily obtain them, which are guaranteed unlocks on your CL pass. After unlocking all Series 2 cards, you enter Series 3, where the bait and switch happens. Series 3 cards are the most interesting and deck defining cards, but the acquisition of them slows down to a crawl, and instead of guaranteed card unlocks, you will find loot boxes on your CL pass, which only has a 50% chance of containing a new card. Consider, that Series 3 has by far the most cards in it, (S1 = 46 cards, S2 = 25 cards, S3 = 77+ cards) and it will just keep growing as the devs keep adding new cards in the game. The whole system is just gacha and an insane grind, and the chance you get the exact cards you need for a certain deck archetype are very slim. But it gets even worse, after around 70 hours of playtime (for me), you will reach CL 1000, where the type of chests will change, and the card acquisition chance goes from 50% to 25%. This is the part where a player will have a set collection, and can barely get any new cards anymore. They either got lucky with good gacha rng until now or they can just uninstall. Getting crushed by meta cards all the time, that you don\\'t own is absolutely miserable.\\nI also mentioned Series 4 and 5. Well, these are super rare cards, that you can also open from the gacha chests 2.5% and 0.25% of the time. So, yeah, don\\'t expect to ever acquire these cards in your life time.\\nAdmittedly, the devs introduced a way to buy the cards with a rotating shop, with a currency, called Tokens. When you open a chest and you don\\'t get a new card, there\\'s a 25% chance you get 100 Tokens instead. A Series 3 card costs 1000 Tokens, Series 4 costs 3000, Series 6 costs 6000. You can probably get around 1000 Tokens in 1 month. So, for missing a chance for a new card, the second best reward is 1/10th of a card instead. Rest of the rewards are cosmetics, or other currencies.\\nThere\\'s also a monthly paid Season pass, which contains a newly added card, with no other way of obtaining until the end of month. Once the Season ends, the card gets added to Series 5, so it\\'ll become basically unobtainable. If that card is strong, that means it\\'s P2W.\\nAnother problem with paid card acquisition, or even cards bought with Tokens is that, what if the card ends up being too strong, so much, that it needs a nerf? Are they just going to screw over all the players that bought it? Are they just going to let the card rampant to avoid backlash? Sooner or later, this will certainly become a problem.\\nSo, yeah, the main problem with the game is this, the card acquisition. There are a lot of other decks I would want to try out, but I just can\\'t, because I have no way to get the required cards for them.\\nThe rest of monetization consists of cosmetics, buying resources to speed up the CL pass leveling, and overpriced bundles exclusively for whales.\\nCosmetics are mainly alternate card arts, which often look pretty nice. Although, these are also ridiculously overpriced; $10 for a .jpeg (or I guess .gif). Also, the shop is rotating every day with just a few of these, so you are more likely to buy something due to FOMO. You can\\'t just go and buy any cosmetic you\\'d like.\\n\\n[h1]Steam Client[/h1]\\nIt basically looks like a mobile emulator, the UI is simply not for PCs. When you click the edge of buttons, it gets pressed down, but nothing actually happens, you have to click the middle. I guess this is excusable, since the game was mainly made for mobile, and the Steam client was rushed. It even says Early Access on the Steam page.\\nOh, and the Inbox, Videos, and News tabs also don\\'t work on PC. So you can\\'t even join events or receive login rewards or compensations. It\\'s been two months since the release, I kinda would have thought this would be a priority to fix.\\n\\n[h1]Closing Words[/h1]\\nOverall I still really like the game, but I want to see major changes. Introducing Tokens was a step in the right direction, but series 4 and 5 cards were two steps back. So for now I have to leave this as a negative review, but that can change in the future.',\n",

No option to recover even if you spent money. Im honestly suprised that this is even allowed to happen on a platform like steam. Their is a high chance even a month after this review first went up that you will be straight up scammed.\\n\\nPSA: DO NOT PLAY ON STEAM RIGHT NOW.\\n\\nI'm being 100% serious when i say this. There are too many issues(ones that can literally cost you money and time i.e. google play not syncing correctly, sudden loss of progression, no longer able to load into the game at all, double charges on purchases that aren't being refunded with a terrible CS team.) to be worth playing on steam. They should not have released it on steam in this state especially with issues that can actually cost you money. You can argue early access all you want but when you have microtransactions that cant be refunded through steam and then the ability to lose those purchases through no fault of your own or be charged more then you should, there is a huge issue. The developers have been slow to react to any of this. The only way to actually contact them is through a discord support channel and hope to god they see it, and even if they do it doesnt seem like they have actually dealt with anyones issues as of yet.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I've been playing MARVEL SNAP since day 1 of the closed beta (a lot!) and it's excellent. The PC client is obviously EA and doesn't support widescreen yet but according to the roadmap, this will be fixed very soon. It's nice that we're now able to play w/o an Android emulator like before. \\n\\nThe game itself is awesome in every regard: It's shiny, fresh, catchy and well-executed. The monetization is also a milestone for mobile-first games - it's not p2w and the time sink for daily and season pass rewards is super fair. SNAP doesn't expect you to play every day and not hours per session and even if you don't, you can get all rewards easily. \\n\\nI really hope that the game will be a smash hit. The team around Ben Brode and other ex-Blizzard-Hearthstone core members deserves that. They were  also very cool and responsive to the player base during beta on their Discord. There was a time when they tested additional monetization strategies like loot boxes and the players hated it. It took them like 2 or 3 weeks to completely remove the feature AND to refund all players with their gold spent. So far, nothing new has been revealed in its place and I seriously think they'll wait until they have something worth showing. Anyways, this showed that they used the beta for well.. testing and that they are genuinely interested in player feedback. I can't imagine many companies would have taken down their secondary monetization engine as fast as Second Dinner did.\\n\\nIMHO one of the best card games out there. Play it, happy snapping!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"(I was in the closed beta, prior to the Steam release, so I've played Marvel Snap for tens of hours more than the review time indicates.)\\n\\nI've spent a lot of time playing digital CCGs.  I started with Magic Online in 2002, and have played a substantial amount of all the major entries, and many of the minor ones.  I've spent the time to get to legend / master rank in Hearthstone, Magic: Arena, Legends of Runeterra and Eternal.  So, is Marvel Snap any good?\\n\\nShort answer is yes, and mostly because the game design is quite different from most of its competitors.  Many of the games I mentioned above feel a bit same-y, mechanically speaking, but Marvel Snap's focus on obtaining control of locations, rather than direct combat, using locations with differing abilities and layout in each game feels fresh.  If you are a digital CCG enjoyer, but are looking for something which feels different, Marvel Snap does that.\\n\\nNow, for some things people might dislike about Marvel Snap - first, you can't target-acquire cards.  The cards you get are random, and while you can pay to accelerate that process, you still get random cards, just faster.  This does mean that you and your opponents can't net-deck -- you need to work with the cards you have to build a deck.  But I can see people who want to play a particular deck being frustrated by the lack of targeted acquisition.\\n\\nThere are a lot of bots, particularly in the lower ranks.  This didn't bother me, but I can see it being an issue for some folks.\\n\\nThe game does aggressively push you toward micro-transactions.  There are season passes to buy, and many other purchase opportunities besides.  It does seem a little crass, but I've have not spent any money and have still enjoyed my time with the game.  The matchmaker finds opponents with a similar 'collection level' (number of cards unlocked), so you aren't really at a disadvantage by not spending money, but the constant temptation to spent to unlock new cards is always present.\\n\\nOverall, thought, the game design here is solid and unique among digital CCGs, so if you can keep your wallet in check, Marvel Snap is worth checking out.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Still on the first pool of cards, but as of now I think Ben Brode and the team at Second Dinner have really come up with something special.\\n\\nThe gameplay itself is bite sized yet full of depth, where a 6 turn game takes maybe 3 minutes yet you\\'ll find yourself making  strategic decisions at nearly every moment.\\n\\nAs someone who does not always have time to sit down and play something for hours at a time, and needs to be able to step away when real life happens, this is perfect because at most you may need to tell someone to wait a couple minutes, or you can even just step away for minimal loss.\\n\\nThe \"Snap\" mechanic feels groundbreaking, incorporating the betting aspect of Poker into a CCG. This allows even more strategic depth, as you can try to win big when doing well, get out early if you don\\'t expect to win, or even possibly bluff the other player into \"folding\" and retreating from the game.\\n\\nI don\\'t know that I\\'ve ever really seen a F2P game as F2P friendly as this. There\\'s incentive to pay a little with things like season pass that feel reasonable, but basically everything is attainable by playing completely F2P as well. There are even caps on how much of the main currency you can earn in a day, even if you\\'re paying money.\\n\\nThat\\'s not to say people will not advance faster by paying more; the process of earning cards can certainly be sped up, but new players with smaller collections won\\'t be matched up against them so it does not ever feel like you\\'re losing because somebody pulled out their credit card and you didn\\'t.\\n\\nIn terms of cons, on PC the UI still feels a bit emulator-ish, which is addressed in the early access description and planned to be improved in the future. Once the UI gets cleaned up and polished, as well as some other features implemented like tokens to get specific cards, I think the game will end up being really solid and fun for both casual and competitive players.\\n\\nAll in all the game feels very elegantly designed with room for growth, with addictive gameplay you can play for 3 minutes or several hours. \\n\\nReally looking forward to see how the game develops and expands in the future, there\\'s truly nothing else like it.',\n",

       "  'review': '2/2/23 Edit: I deleted this off of my PC and phone; I\\'m done being punished for having bad luck with the RNG aspects and money superseding skill. As I stated in my review, it really is a lot of fun and actually very fair early on (that\\'s how they get you). The gameplay loop definitely gets its hooks in you and, before you know it, they might succeed in turning you from a F2P player to another poor sucker to milk. I\\'m not an idiot - I know that\\'s sort of the point of most F2P games, but this one seemed so different at first. I never gave in, but it got to the point that I could either keep banging my head against a wall for a game that isn\\'t going to reward me for my time and skill unless I spend money OR... you know... spend money. I would love to see someone \"borrow\" the format for this game, but then either make it a buy-to-play title with ZERO microtransactions OR make it F2P, but ANY and ALL purchases are cosmetic only. You can\\'t  (shouldn\\'t) mix real money purchases (or obfuscate them through currency exchanges) with the acquisition of cards in a competitive(?) card game. Lastly, I\\'ve come to the conclusion that it\\'s kind of gross that they\\'re pitching this as being in \"Early Access\" when they\\'re taking money from people hand over fist, but still get to fall back on the EA excuse when things don\\'t go right. It works (mostly) for EA titles that are full games with a set price because you\\'re, usually, not expected to pay more after that (maybe a DLC or two are ok IF development is going well); a F2P card battler with paid MTX  constantly bombarding you with \"Buy me! Buy me!\" just doesn\\'t fit that mentality.\\n\\n\\n\\nVery fun and addicting game. You will have a blast early on. However, once you dip your toes into pool 3 cards and beyond, you will see how predatory the systems in place really are. You can have a decent time as a purely F2P player, like myself, but you will grow tired of seeing certain meta decks that are mostly impossible to get without paying. By time you MIGHT possibly assemble the top meta deck from a month or so back for free, the new meta flavor of the month will be there to ruin your fun. Couple this with huge, sweeping effects from RNG like locations/cards that play for you, having to draw from your opponent’s deck, losing your deck and getting random cards, and so on and so forth. There needs to be a huge balance pass on cards, locations, AND the current means of EARNING cards. Cards with amazing abilities that can’t be directly countered because they aren’t typed as “ongoing” or “on reveal” abilities need to be addressed ASAP (I’m looking at you Lockjaw and Dracula). Great game, but it’s trying to cross the line between “pay for convenience” and “pay to win” without being noticed; we see you.',\n",

       "  'review': \"EDIT: After the recent update (11th January 2023), there's been some concerns for the acquisition of cards from Series 4 & 5. Some Discord messages from developers at Second Dinner seem to be reassuring players, so it will be worth waiting to see how that pans out. Other than the Season Passes for each season post-launch, I've not spent a penny and received plenty of Series 3 & 4 cards, both in Reserves and the Token Shop. I still think the game is a recommendation, but do NOT buy the bundle, especially the new Pro Bundle. Boosters can be earned in-game easily and the credits, while valuable, end up only being about 2 and a half weeks worth. Review continues below.\\n\\nMost of my gametime is via mobile. I'm currently at Collection Level 2000+ for reference on my time spent with the game!\\n\\nCons:\\n- Events are lacklustre. They're working on these in future but so far they offer no real value.\\n- Steam client is pretty bad and the UI isn't the best\\n\\nPros:\\n+ Extremely fun gameplay with an addictive feel\\n+ Completely free-to-play. You don't need to spend a penny to enjoy the content, which makes you want to spend money simply to support it.\\n+ Cards are all interesting and their abilities match their comic versions perfectly.\\n+ The standard and variant cards are all well-designed and gorgeous (except Pixel Variants, which look pretty terrible) \\n+ New Token system allows you to pick out cards you want from an 8-hour rotation. You can pin them so they stay there, allowing you to build decks better.\\n\\nOverall an excellent game. While the Steam version needs a bit of love from the developers, the overall experience is absolutely amazing. One of the best, if not THE BEST, free-to-play game on mobile and Steam alike.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The current early access version of the game is very bare minimum from a PC standpoint. The game itself is so fun and addictive, but for the moment I recommend playing Marvel Snap on a mobile phone if possible. The PC-version is a nice addition however and you can sync your progress across devices with a google-account which I love. I like the plans the developers have of releasing the full game for PC in mid-2023 including a better UI experience, fullscreen, more features etc. It feels like a good plan for the future and I\\'m hopefull of the game. \\n\\nMarvel snap is easily the best game on mobile at the moment and free-to-play so I would recommend people to give it a try. I\\'ll update the review when Marvel Snap comes out of early access. My playtime on Steam is not a correct representation of my time with the game since I\\'ve played a bunch on my phone and currently I\\'ve reached the Infinite-rank (the highest rank in the game, level 100+). \\n\\nYou don\\'t need to purchase anything to play Marvel Snap and have fun but season pass is a nice addition if you wanna support the developers and have some further progress to work towards every month. You can build a decent deck with cards you achieve early on and skill and understanding of the game is more important then having all the cards. Basically nobody has all the cards since most new cards are super-rare. The developers have said they\\'re working on some sort of solution for improving this system in the future. Most importantly is to understand when you should surrender/retreat, and when to snap and keep going. When I learned this I quickly advanced in rank.\\n\\nI\\'ve built decks with cards from the early pools (1-2) and you can climb to the highest ranks with that basic stuff as long as you understand all the game mechanics and synergies well and can predict what the opponent is trying to do. I recommend players to experiment with different decks to learn the game at first, for example you can play a deck with ongoing abilities, on-reveal cards, discard/destroy, big power cards or swarm the deck with loads of small cards. Marvel snap is also about psychology and mindgames with the opponent and I love that complexity within such a \"simple\" game concept and mobile game. It\\'s so refreshing to have a card game where a game takes about 2 minutes per match, that makes it less frustrating and more casual to play, coming from someone that have invested a lot of time in Dota, CS, hearthstone, etc.\\n\\nThe bundles in Marvel snap is often too pricy in my opinion. Sometimes there will be a cheaper bundle, like the beginner bundle, which offers great value for players. Most bundles are not great in terms of price, the season pass is reasonable I think for all the fun it provides me. The good thing is that you don\\'t really have to spend any more money then you are comfortable with. You don\\'t need cool skins and flashy details on your cards to win games. ',\n",

       "  'review': 'This is actually a really cool card game. It\\'s fast-paced, pretty to look at, has good animations, easy to understand, fun to theorycraft and deckbuild, and it really allows you to strategize and mindgame.\\n\\nYou assemble a deck of 12 comic book favorites and play out 3 simultaneous tug-of-war\\'s. Each card has an energy cost and  power. You start at 1 energy on turn 1, leading up to 6 on turn 6. There are 3 lanes/fields/zones/areas to play on, that can hold 4 cards each. The player with the most power in a lane wins that lane. Win 2 of the 3 lanes by the end of the game and you win the overall game.\\n\\nSimple and wonderfully designed. The three lanes change every game, sometimes even during it. It offers a unique approach to dispelling the boredom of piloting the same deck over and over. Overall, a lot of fun.\\n\\n[b]So... why do I not recommend it?[/b]\\n\\nYour progression is gated by an arbitrary schedule that you cannot circumvent whatsoever. If you are unable to play this game EVERY SINGLE DAY, for at least an hour or more, then you will eventually get lapped by every single other serious player. Maybe you\\'re okay with that. If you are, then play the game. It\\'s great.\\n\\nHowever, if you are a competitive person, having come from MtG, LoR, ES: Legends, or others, you might be bothered. I had a busy week this past week. I couldn\\'t play the game to grind out my dailies, or even load it up to acquire the free currency you\\'re allotted per day. I\\'m now unable to unlock anymore cards until the game\\'s schedule allows me to. I could play for 3 hours straight, and never get anything more than what I currently have.\\n\\nI\\'m actually incentivized to NOT play the game unless I want to grind the ranked ladder, or just screw around. Because after my dailies are done, there\\'s nothing more that I can do, aside from burn out on the game. Furthermore, even if I wanted to grind the ranked ladder, eventually I\\'m forced into dealing with players who have unlocked cards beyond the initial pool 1 set. Players who have paid money, have played every single day, or both. Due to the quasi-linearity of card unlocks, some of the cards from the subsequent pool 2 and pool 3 sets are just absurdly powerful compared to the pool 1 selection. Games are still winnable, but I\\'m practically forced to utilize the games retreat system in nearly half my games when facing more refined and developed decks.\\n\\nThe thing is, I have no complaints about playing against people who\\'ve paid money, or played every day. They got their unlocks through their avenue of achievement. They earned it. However, I would\\'ve played SNAP for hours today if I was able to earn at least something towards my progression. If someone plays every single day they\\'re rewarded, but if someone else puts in the exact same amount of time, but only over the course of 3 or 4 days, they\\'re punished. How does that make any sense?\\n\\nI know that this game uses these predatory psychological practices in order to try to break down my mentality. Attempting to make me want to spend cash monies in order to stay competitive. It\\'s upsetting because in some other card games I was able to unlock everything, or nearly everything, on MY OWN schedule.\\n\\nTo further this problem even more, there is currently a card that is hard gated behind a paywall. It\\'s included only in the paid season pass. Right now it might not seem like a big deal, but down the line there will be dozens of cards that were all real money exclusive. Eventually, some of those cards WILL be highly sought after for whatever the meta is like at the time. How many times will you be willing to shell out $10 for your competitive edge?\\n\\nIn closing, the game is really cool. Again, if none of this bothers you, go ahead and have fun. And if you\\'re able to shell out an extra $20 or so, go for it. While the game may be free to download and play, it is NOT free to progress, unless you enslave yourself to the ridiculous limitations that the developers chose for you to deal with. It\\'s the same ol\\' crap, like RAID, and many other \"free\" to play mobile-centered titles. Games that actively prey on the fear of missing out, and people\\'s natural competitiveness.',\n",

       "  'review': '[i]\"This game has 3 huge things going in its favor.  A good Marvel game, a fast card game, quick progression to keep you hooked.  If you consider yourself a superhero fan and like strategy, try this game.\"[/i]\\n\\nThis game is an easy recommend because I went into it looking directly for certain things and it passed in all those areas.  Did I feel like the games were quick and I wouldn\\'t have to dedicate 10 plus minutes a match? Yes.  The trailers looked like it was a complete tribute to Marvel, did it scratch that Marvel itch? Yes. What about progression and did it seem to quickly come to a halt unless I went into the Shop to spend real money? No.  That is what I was looking for, a fast match, quick progression game that screamed Marvel and made me want to play with some of my favorite characters from the Marvel Universe. \\n\\nI\\'ll give you some Pros and Cons below but being that this game is free-to-play I would suggest if you even remotely seem interested by the trailer, you should give it a shot.  I can safely say this game is exactly as it is advertised to be.\\n\\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\\n\\n- Marvel tribute.  From the art, to the sounds, to the effects and more.  This screams Marvel all the way.\\n\\n- Fast.  You both play your turn at the same time.  There is only 6 rounds.  \\n\\n- Still fun strategy.  Most cards have some kind of ability.  Those abilities and where you place the cards will win games.\\n\\n- Organic unlocking.  I didn\\'t feel forced to do any particular thing aside from playing matches to unlock things.\\n\\n- Shop did not feel forced.\\n\\n- Season Pass did not feel forced.\\n\\n- Still after 90 minutes play time am I learning new mechanics but I was out of the tutorial fast and had a good understanding of how to play in just minutes.\\n\\n- Tons of your favorite characters, their personalities, as well as possibly characters you\\'ve never seen in a Marvel game before.\\n\\n- The Snap mechanic feels fresh and new in card games and fits well in a Marvel game.\\n\\n- Quick Download.\\n\\n- Fast queue times.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\\n\\n- Some players might wish for more customization early on.\\n\\n- For people who play very deep mechanical card games this might be a little too simple.\\n\\n- There is a Cash Shop.  Just remember that it is free to play and the game has to make some kind of revenue in order to operate.\\n\\n- There isn\\'t single player so remember that one day this game may go away.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\n\\nIf you like Marvel and the trailer looks interesting to you, do yourself a favor and try this game out.  The way everything unfolds to you as a new player happens very organically and you\\'ll have an excellent idea in about an hour if you really enjoy this game or not.  My guess is that most people will.  I think they have a real winning formula here.  Hopefully as I play more it will continue to stay this good.\\n\\n[code]If you enjoyed this review and would like to see more detailed reviews by me please consider joining my curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42726367-Gamer-Sessions/]Gamer Sessions[/url].[code]',\n",

       "  'review': 'Starting out with the positive: probably the best gameplay of competitive digital card games, much stronger then Hearthstone, LOR, etc. Very good new player experience. Legitimately, it feels like 60% of cards can be played as well. There are far fewer useless cards then say, LOR or Hearthstone. \\n\\nHowever, I cannot recommend this game for a few reasons: \\n1. Unsatisfying (bordering on predatory) monetization as you get later in your collection. Cards are separated into pools, and getting into Pool 3 feels like a significant slog compared to the first two pools. F2P, you are expected to get 1-2 new Pool 3 cards in a week, and if all you have received that week is D tier cards, it can feel pretty bad when you lose to someone who has a stronger collection. Anecdotally, it feels like I am constantly playing people with complete combos with my janky slapped together deck with holes in it. Paying small amounts of money does not really help either. $5-10 dollars really only progresses you through a few caches. This issue is magnified later. Once you complete Pool 3, you are expected to get new cards at a rate of 1-2 *a month* (to be fair, I am still working through Pool 3, so I am hearing this secondhand). They have bundles to progress you faster, but they cost between $50-100 dollars. They are moving some cards down to lower pools, but it remains to be seen how much this affects the experience. \\n2. Technical issues with their programming. There are multiple tales on the subreddit of people being double charged for items and then not being able to get refunds. Personally, I had a card that would be considered one of the strongest meta cards pinned in their token shop for over a week, but apparently these cards can become unpinned if you press Esc ANYWHERE in the PC client. When I tried contacting support to see if they could repin the card in my shop (I did not want compensation, just to have the card added back), they told me I was basically SOL and would have to hope I opened that card or that it miraculously showed up again. \\n\\nHopefully they can fix these issues, as this game is very promising. If they do, I will update my review.',\n",

Like, punch a mirror and bleed your hand low. \\n\\nSome cards just kill the fun, and RNG can really affect you (in my case)  emotionally when things go bad for you for an extended period of time. Put you into an existential crisis and all that. But overall, there are many ways to win. There's room for creativity in the game. \\n\\nOh, and another issue that's specific to the PC version: The UI. It's basically ported from the mobile version. Hope they make a PC-specific UI.\",\n",

The quick 6 (sometimes 7) turn games make picking up and putting down Marvel Snap easy, however, just because they're quick doesn't mean you won't be spending a TON of time playing the game. This thing grabs you and just doesn't let go. It's a 10 out of 10 for me. \\n\\nTo add, If you're a huge comic nerd like myself, lookout, you won't be spending your money on that next ratio variant of that title you collect, you'll be farming gold or whaling on some amazing and very recognizable variant art in game.

(there is also a battlepass)\\n\\nThe gameplay loop is pretty fun to learn but hard to master due to there being random terrains each match that you have to adapt to on the fly, which keeps things fresh and exciting.\\n\\nAll in all a very fun card battler with no P2W elements, highly recommended!',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]MARVEL SNAP [/h1]\\n\\nMarvel SNAP is a new F2P card game. It's very easy to learn, fast-paced, addictive and fun to play! It's in early access and I couldn't recommend it more. Very good ranking system. Played it for 9 hours so far and ranking system is fair. You can't get matched against players who have better cards than you thanks to the system; you only get matched with players who have starter decks. As you climb ranks you will encounter some new cards.\\n\\nGameplay is very simple. There are 3 lanes, you need to have more points in 2 lanes to win. Each lane will have a unique effect which you should be careful about and use to your advantage. Tip for new players: don't focus on all 3 lanes because you will spread the points too much. If you see you have to catch up a lot in one lane, just focus on other 2 lanes to win. If you see you are going to lose then use the Retreat button, you will actually loose less points when you do that. Use a snap button if you think you are going to win, if possible do it early for higher reward, but then it's also higher risk. This game is very fast-paced so don't worry about loses, just use Retreat button and move to the next match. \\n\\nThere are 12 cards in deck and cards cost 1-6 energy. Each turn you gain one more energy and there are total of 6 turns. Try out all cards, see which is good and not, build your strategy. Don't netdeck as a newbie, just focus to learn the game and you will love it. See what cards works for you, which cards have synergy and build your strategy as you unlock better and stronger cards. And always make sure to upgrade every card you can! This is how you earn new cards!\\nEnjoy the game, and if you get bored it's still a great time-killer from time to time!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It may well be a mobile game but in a world full garbage pay-to-win clones, Marvel Snap stands out as something special. \\n\\nWhat I would ordinarily describe as a rather lacklustre card game, is elevated; albeit, completely changed by the introduction of poker mechanics to the ranked system. Each player has the option of raising the stakes at any point over a six round game, doubling the risk/reward of each game. The catch; you can retreat at anytime just like you fold a hand in poker. It's a revolutionary mechanism for a competitive card of this nature and it is truly a joy to play.\\n\\nThe game itself is graphically slick in it's animations and really quick to play. It's the perfect pick-up-and-play for a few minutes of downtime you may have spare. Furthermore, there is no pay to win model here. Money can be spent on gaining cosmetic card variants or currency to advance your player level to get new cards; yet you will only be matched against players of a similar player level, so games will always be evenly matched when it comes to the size of your card collection.\\n\\nNow I don't think Marvel Snap will be for everyone, but if you enjoy Marvel, digital card games or poker; you should really give this one a try. It's better on mobile, but having the option to link my account with Steam and play on my PC is very much welcomed, even if the devs still have a few interface issues to resolve on the PC version.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Marvel Snap is a quick, cathartic (one might say \"snappy\") experience. Each match is quick and rewarding with a good depth of strategy. You really get a sense that every decision matters and that you almost always have a chance of winning on the last play. This makes the design decision to make choosing how far to push your luck a part of the strategy inspired. I kinda wish that when you choose to retreat, you could still see your opponent\\'s next play, but I\\'m just the kind of person who likes to know for sure whether I made the right choice or not. Overall, I\\'d say I really enjoy the gameplay of Marvel Snap.\\n\\nWhich makes it all the more unfortunate that that gameplay is grafted onto an addiction simulator. So, the way getting new cards in this game works is you have a \"collection level\" that you increase by upgrading your existing cards with progressively more elaborate effects. Starting out, you get a reward every 2 collection levels and half of those rewards are random cards. You upgrade cards by spending \"Credits\" and \"Boosters\". Boosters are tracked per card, and after every match one card in your deck gets a number of boosters equal to the number of turns you played, while Credits are earned by completing daily missions or buying them with \"Gold\". When you first start playing, you have 1,000 Credits, a full set of daily missions, and a free \"Recruits\" season pass that gives you cards, Credits, and even a little Gold. The dopamine flows as you\\'re freely able to upgrade cards and unlock new cards. I got my rank up to Silver before my cobbled together cards started really losing ground to more synergistic decks, and that\\'s precisely when the Credits ran out. And that\\'s when I started to see that this monetization model was everything I feared it would be and more.\\n\\nLet\\'s get back to the Collection Level rewards. I\\'d mentioned that half of the rewards you get are cards, well the other half is mostly credits, with the occasional boosters. This does two things. First, it makes so that players are spending Credits and Boosters to get lesser amounts of Credits and Boosters(I\\'ll be revisiting this). Second, it prolongs the dopamine spike you get when your daily missions come in and you\\'re unlocking things again, but in a way that gets lesser and lesser as your upgrades get more expensive, this is the crux of why I call it an \"addiction simulator\".\\n\\nLet\\'s take a closer look at Credit rewards vs costs. Every 12 hours you get two new daily missions that seem to hold to a pattern of one mission worth 50 Credits, and a \"Hard\" mission worth 100 credits. You can also get 50 free credits in the shop every 24 hours. So barring the occasional free Credits reward from the free version of the season pass, you can expect about 350 Credits a day, in increments of 150 and 200. A card\\'s first upgrade costs 25 Credits and awards 1 Collection Level, the second upgrade costs 100 Credits and awards 2 collection levels, and the third upgrade costs 200 credits and awards 4 collection levels. Interesting that level 2 is half the value for your credits and level 3 is only a little over half the daily credit income for a free player. It\\'s almost like it was intentionally designed so that if you want to get the most out of your investment, you either need to buy more credits, or play new cards. Except that I need even more cards to make another deck work than I do to plug the holes in my current one, so I guess I need to buy more credits anyway. This is also where we delve deeper into the other half of the Collector Level rewards. For the most part, it\\'s 2 levels for a card, then another 2 levels for 25 Credits, with the Credits reward occasionally replaced with 5 Boosters for a random card. So even if we count from card to Credit reward, you are at best spending 50 Credits to get 25 Credits back, and at worst you\\'re spending 100 credits to get 25 back. That\\'s not even gambling, that\\'s spending currency to get a lesser amount of the same currency. The only reason for these rewards to exist is to keep you chasing the high of upgrading one more card, getting one more level closer to unlocking your next mystery card.\\n\\nAnd one minor note. I actually like the idea of \"Hot Locations\" but in practice it just feels like something to build a sense of urgency around collecting enough cards to build specific decks. At the time of writing this review, the location \"Shuri\\'s Lab\" is hot, Providing a location that doubles the power of cards played there in, what was it, 60% of games? At the rank I\\'m stuck at, I see a lot of people just dropping the Hulk to get the most possible power in that location, and I\\'m left thinking I\\'d sure love to be playing a movement deck so I can leave your 24 power Hulk here and take my upgrades to the other locations, but I\\'ve only got a few movement cards and they\\'re all small, early plays.\\n\\nTL;DR: It\\'s a fun card game designed to manipulate you into buying a dopamine hit. Nuff said.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game looked really promising when it started, however as the game getting updates I am afraid it will only go worse from here on, here are several (significant) problem I found with the game:\\n\\n1) \"Free to play\" is a nice word but do not exactly work here. At pool 1 it is a complete free to play experience, and you can probably get through pool 2 at a reasonable pace, but starting from pool 3 the card pool just get expanded so much that you will just struggle for a long time before you get the necessary card to beat other pool 3 decks (or get key card for specific deck, like Destroyer, which require significant luck).\\n\\nHowever, this is made worse by that (either by bug or intentional, from my experience), you can encounter pool 3 decks before you reach pool 3. For me I am playing pool 2 (definitely haven\\'t reach the collection level for pool 3), but starting at Cube Level 50 I encounter almost exclusively pool 3 decks, which of course, I can\\'t beat because their cards are just stronger. The only viable deck become \"deny deck\" utilizing cards such as Cosmo, Enchantress, Shang-Chi and Leech which of course feels very bad as effectively you cannot win on your own.\\n\\n2) New cards are strong, which should be the case as otherwise no one will ever play the new cards. HOWEVER, considering new cards are getting added to the \"ultra rare\" Pool 4 and 5 cards just means it is inaccessible for most F2P player unless they are determined to clock in hours every single day and have the resolve to grind through the early F2P experience. I will imagine this can only get worse as the game progress.\\n\\n3) \"Time gate\" mobile phone game mechanics. Because of the time gate (as in you only get fix amount of credit per day), new player will simply eventually be unable to catch up as the game gets updated. Or otherwise stop playing for a single day then you effectively lose ~10 collection level of progress. Worse of all, you don\\'t really get rewarded for playing more, as grinding the F2P version of battlepass is extremely slow and tedious, while grinding cubes will encounter the problem above where you simply face stronger deck than your card pool. Eventually you will basically be \"forced\" to top up or otherwise only be able to play (fairly) at Pool 1 and 2.\\n\\nEdited: 4) The \"Escape\" mechanic is a great concept as essentially it provides an additional incentive in how you play the game (eg: you can bluff etc), but is also its downfall. You gain very minimum cube even if you win (2), lower if they escape early; you basically have to snap/your opponent snapping for you to gain any reasonable progress. However, you or your opponent can always just leave which essentially abruptly ending the game, the only situation where you can gain lots of cubes is only if your opponent is overconfident and didn\\'t expect your counterplay, which happen less and less at higher cube level; EVEN WORSE for pool 2 decks when they encounter pool 3 decks at high cube level because there are a lot less \"surprise power\" in pool 2 cards which makes your power very predictable. You are basically hard stucked afterwards because your deck is simply not strong enough.\\n\\nAll in all while this is a game worth playing (Pool 1 and 2), however because of all of its design incentivizing playing for the long term, I cannot recommend this game simply because especially for Free To Play players their Pool 3 experience will be pretty terrible.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I would not recommend playing Marvel Snap despite it being a simple, fast, fun, and well designed mobile card game. The reason being is a wide number of issues but at its core the LOOT BOX card unlock system (introduced in pool 3 so it is a bit of a bait and trap system) and the wide range of collection level matchmaking in pool 3 since this has questionable balance for new players. To me, these core issues actually make the overall experience in Marvel Snap a more frustrating experience than fun. \\n\\nMy experience in pool 3 has been continuously playing against players that have extremely powerful series 3, 4, and 5 cards that I did not access to yet. For series 4 and 5, I likely would not have access to them several months. SNAP is balanced such that these are all counterable cards, but I felt like I had to play to disrupt/counter their decks, rely on luck in lockjaw decks, or play leech decks (quite toxic) to be competitive. Since on raw power alone, my decks generally did not compete with theirs. \\n \\nThe LOOT BOX mechanics for cards means that specific cards can't be targeted without use of the overpriced and limited token shop. Further cards are not guaranteed to be unlocked from caches and reserves in pool 3 which also decreases in frequency from 8 to 12 collection levels. This used to be worse, but still feels bad man. \\n\\nFurther the new card releases have been very strong and almost exclusively for series 4 and 5 which means I am likely further away from completing my card collection than when I started and will continuously have less competitive options due to power creep of the new cards being introduced.  \\n\\nOverall the above issues make the overall journey in this game an frustrating experience that could be a  exercise in futility if a full collection is your goal that I would not recommend to others. However if you just want to play some casual games to do the daily missions and and don't mind seeing and losing to cards you don't have access to (and likely won't have access to for months or years) or enjoy the challenge of fighting against meta decks despite having less access to card options/power, then it might be an enjoyable experience for you. \",\n",

In effect this heavily punishes players who only want to play for a small amount each day - to even collect quest rewards when you first hit this cap unsuspecting you'll be forced to grind hours extra to earn enough boosters, or just miss out on what you earned.  From there you can buy the incredibly inefficient quick boosts from the store to use up some gold but it's still not ideal and feels punishing.\\n\\nThe second issue is that the devs have started giving communication with in-game currency through mail which is only accessible on a mobile device.

       "  'review': \"This is a game that has no validation to not allow any player buy anything until they put their apple or google account. 100 hours and 35 euros wasted. If our progress and our money are not saved in steam cloud, how you allow anyone that obviously doesn't know that to buy anything. Its a simple validation that is missing obviously to maximize sales. There is a pop up when you start the game for the first time about google account. If you skip that to do it later and you forget it, or even if you don't want to link your google account at all, a change to steam(uninstall, change pc and login to steam again, format) will cost you everything. Support is not answering too. This is the first game that lost all my progress on steam. Never expected something like that and obviously not for an online pvp game with transactions.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Edit: Thanks for all the rewards and positive feedback guys. <3\\n\\nI played the game extensively on iOS during the beta. The journey through the first 3 pools was really fun. For me, the thing that makes CCGs fun is the regular drip feed of new cards, which keeps things fresh and interesting. Pools 1-3 did this really well.\\n\\nI was super excited for the new cards in Pool 4/5. However, I have to say, I'm not enjoying it at all. \\n\\nThe drop rate of Pool 4 cards is just 2.5%. Pool 5 cards are 10x rarer than that! My collection progress has hit a brick wall and, honestly, it's just not fun any more. \\n\\nThe Collector's Token system is also problematic. Tokens are hard to acquire: Pool 5 cards cost 6,000 tokens, that is months of grinding. As a result, Pool 5 cards have a very high opportunity cost: buy a dud, and you'll find it hard to recover. \\n\\nNow, I would love to mess around with Galactus or Thanos, and have fun. I honestly believe that's what the devs want. But, because of the way they have designed the economy, the opportunity cost is way too high. \\n\\nAgain, not fun.\\n\\nTo be clear, I do not expect to own every card. However, for Pool 4/5 I feel like Marvel Snap has gone in the other direction: it has made cards so rare, it's no longer fun for high CL players. It's really disappointing and I hope things change.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The Hog Rider card is unlocked from the Spell Valley (Arena 5). He is a very fast building-targeting, melee troop with moderately high hitpoints and damage. He appears just like his Clash of Clans counterpart; a man with brown eyebrows, a beard, a mohawk, and a golden body piercing in his left ear who is riding a hog. A Hog Rider card costs 4 Elixir to deploy.\\nStrategy\\nHis fast move speed can boost forward mini tanks like an Ice Golem in a push. At the same time, he can also function as a tank for lower hitpoint troops such as Goblins as he still has a fair amount of health. Most cheap swarms complement the Hog Rider well, as they are nearly as fast as him and usually force more than one card out of the opponent's hand.\\nThe Hog Rider struggles with swarms, as they can damage him down and defeat him quickly while obstructing his path. Barbarians in particular can fully counter him without very strict timing on the defender's part, though be wary of spells.\\nA Hunter can kill the Hog Rider in 2 hits if placed right on top of it. However, if you place something in front of the Hog Rider, the Hunter's splash will damage the Hog Rider and hit the card in front of it more.\\nThe Hog Rider in conjunction with the Freeze can surprise the opponent and allow the Hog Rider to deal much more damage than anticipated, especially if the opponent's go-to counter is a swarm, or swarms are their only effective counter to him. Skeletons and Bats will immediately be defeated by the spell, while Spear Goblins, Goblins, and Minions will be at low enough health to be defeated by a follow up Zap or Giant Snowball.\\nHowever, this strategy isn't very effective against buildings as the Hog Rider will take a while to destroy the building, giving the opponent ample time to articulate another counter.\\nAgainst non-swarm troops, it can deal a lot of damage during the freeze time, but this can allow the opponent to set up a massive counterpush. For this reason, players should either only go for a Hog Rider + Freeze when they have other units backing it up from a counterattack, or if the match is about to end and they need to deal as much damage as possible.\\nIt is not a good idea to send in a Hog Rider simply to destroy a building, especially if it is the only building targeting unit available, as defeating Crown Towers becomes substantially more difficult. Spells or simply waiting out the lifetime of the building are more effective. The exception to this is an Elixir Collector placed in front of the King's Tower. If a Hog Rider placed at the bridge, he can destroy the Collector for a positive Elixir trade, though the damage from both Princess Towers will usually mean he does not survive to deal any damage to them. However, if the opponent sends in defending troops, it can be an opportunity to gain spell damage value.\\nIn a deck with several low-cost cards, it might be worth it to simply send the Hog Rider against one building. These decks shuffle their card rotation quick enough, that they will arrive to their next Hog Rider before the next building arrives in the opponent's card rotation.\\nLong-ranged troops like Musketeer and Flying Machine can snipe those buildings, preserving some of the Hog Rider's health, possibly allowing it to get some Tower damage.\\nWhen there are buildings placed in the middle to counter the Hog Rider, understanding the placement of the Hog Rider and the type of building placed can help the Hog Rider to bypass certain buildings.\\nPassive buildings such as spawners and Elixir Collector have a larger hitbox than defensive buildings; which means that if a passive building was placed 3 tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, then it is impossible for the Hog Rider to bypass that placement as the Hog Rider will get pulled to that building.\\nDefensive buildings have a smaller hitbox than a passive building, which means if that if a defensive building was placed three tiles away from the river in the middle of the opponent's side, a Hog Rider placed at the very left or right side of the Arena may be able to bypass it due to its smaller hitbox.\\nIf the player has a building already placed down in the center of the arena, and the opponent tries to bypass it with a Hog Rider at the edge of the arena, they can use certain air troops to push the Hog Rider towards the building as it jumps over the river, effectively denying the bypass attempt. They must be already hovering over the correct placement, as very quick reflexes are required to correctly perform this technique.\\nFor Bats, Skeleton Dragons, and Minion Horde, they should be placed right in front of the Hog Rider as soon as it is deployed.\\nFor Minions, Skeleton Barrel, Mega Minion, Flying Machine, Electro Dragon, Baby Dragon, Inferno Dragon, Balloon, and Lava Hound, stagger the above placement one tile to the right if the Hog Rider is placed on the left side of the arena, and vice versa.\\nThey can also use ground troops to achieve the same result. Something like an Ice Golem deployed at the Hog Rider’s landing spot will obstruct his path and force him to go around the unit, which causes him to be closer to the building instead of the Crown Tower.\\nThe Hog Rider can kite Very Fast non-building targeting troops due to his own Very Fast speed and building only targeting if he is placed on the fourth tile from the bridge, slightly into the opposite lane. He can also stall grounded units when placed right at the bridge. He will pull them towards him while deploying, and then be untargetable by them when he jumps over the bridge. After landing, he will pull them back. This can be useful when the player needs to deal damage in the same lane they are defending. It will also help separate troops behind a tank in a large push.\\nA Tornado placed on the second tile front of the player's King's Tower and staggered two tiles towards the Princess Tower will activate it without any damage dealt to the Princess Tower, helping them in defending future pushes. This can also be a method of mitigating all damage dealt to a Princess Tower, but doing this more than three times may result in the King's Tower's health being low enough to be targeted directly, opening up the possible threat of a back door three crown. A better alternative is to pull the Hog away from the Princess Tower into the attacking range of all three Crown Towers, which will negate all damage as long as none of them are already distracted\\nA very powerful combo is the Hog Rider, the Musketeer, and the Valkyrie, typically referred to as the Trifecta. The Musketeer will defend against most troops, while the Valkyrie can protect her and the Hog Rider from swarms or high damage units. The Hog Rider is used to deal damage to the tower.\\nThis can be effectively countered by Lightning, one-shotting the Musketeer and severely damaging both the Valkyrie and Hog Rider. The Minion Horde is also effective, but the enemy can Zap them and the Musketeer will one-shot them all. Even if the Musketeer is defeated, the Hog Rider and Valkyrie will have enough time to severely damage the Tower.\\nThe Hog Rider should be placed behind the Valkyrie to give it a boost so that it stays in front of the Hog Rider, protecting it.\\nA Hog Rider combined with a Goblin Barrel can be awkward for the opponent to defend against. Timing it so that the Hog Rider is tanking the tower shots for the Goblins is the most effective way to deal damage. However, a Barbarian Barrel can shut this down with minimal Tower damage for a positive Elixir trade, as long as the Goblin Barrel was placed directly on the Tower.\\nPairing the Hog Rider with the Balloon can deal devastating damage. If executed properly, the Hog Rider will act as a tank while the Balloon threatens to deal massive damage. The Hog Rider can also destroy any buildings attempting to slow down the combo. However, this combo is very vulnerable to swarms and anti-air cards as neither of the troops target anything but buildings.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I'm torn because this game, mechanics wise, is so incredibly fun and interesting. There's a sort of perfect balance between RNG and decision making that kinda makes it feel a little bit like a party game, where someone could be behind, but it's still anyone's game if they make the right play. It definitely feels a little bit like gambling, especially with the snap feature, but without real money on the line. The game's are also super fast, so even when you lose, it's not painful because you can queue up and find another match immediately to try again.\\n\\nThe big deal breaker for me, and why I can't recommend this game to anyone, is the progression system. One of the things you need to unlock new cards is a currency called credits, which are locked behind daily quests, so you can only earn a max each day with no alternative. You get two quests every eight hours, and can only have six at any given time, which can put a lot of pressure on you to keep coming back so you don't fall behind. I've played games like this, and it was always such a relief to quit them. I've already got anxiety inducing stuff in my life, I don't need my games to be that way, too.\\n\\nIt's really such a shame, because I could totally see myself investing literally hundreds of hours in a game like this, experimenting with all sorts of decks and card combinations, climbing the ranks, and upgrading all my cards to make them look super pretty, but there's no way to buy all the cards for a fair price or unlock them at your own pace. They did say they were going to add a token mechanic that lets you have a little bit more control over which cards you unlock, but it's tied to a rotating shop which changes each day, so you have no idea when the cards you're looking for will show up, and you could miss them by being busy.\\n\\nTLDR: Amazing and fun game mechanics, but progression is forcefully diluted over months of daily quests, and little bits of playing here and there. You're not allowed to earn content at your own pace, you must play on their schedule. If that works for you, you'll have a LOT of fun, but if you're like me, it's going to add extra anxiety and pressure that you just don't need in your life.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It's a fast-paced card game, where a single match takes usually 2-3 mins. The game rules are easy to learn. During each turn players are planning their actions and the turn resolves after both of them confirmed their plans. The game heavily relies on taking a risk similarly to classic gambling games such as Poker. Every match contains 3 random locations, where each location twists game rules, forcing players to reconsider and adjust their strategies.\\n\\nProgression system doesn't seems to be an issue: starter cards turned out to be very versatile and allowed to easily climb the rank. Every card seems to have a purpose, but some are heavily depended on synergies.\\n\\nSince the matches are quite short, you will be able to play dozens of game during a few hours. Simple rules and short matches might make the game feel repetitive. The game was designed mainly for a mobile devices.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve been a Marvel fan since I was a little kid back in the 80\\'s, and I like deckbuilding games too, so I was always going to try this free game - at least for a little bit. After booting it up for the first time, I think I might have played for 10 hours straight... \\n\\nThe concept is very simple and each game is very quick - about 3-5 minutes each. Searching for games takes about 2-3 seconds which makes it seem like you are hitting \"play\" one more time almost without even thinking... \\n\\nProgression is going to seem pretty fast those first 10-12 hours - but I think I\\'ve hit the wall where things start to slow down a bit. I don\\'t mind though, because the game is fun to play, and the matchmaking only puts you up against people in the same \"card pool\" meaning you are all working from the same pool of cards, have relatively the same amount, but have unlocked random cards from that same pool.\\n\\nThat\\'s a more detailed way of saying that this game is not pay-to-win.\\n\\nThe play area is divided into 3 lanes - and you need to have higher total power in at least 2 lanes to win the game - very straight forward. What makes the game dynamic and interesting is how each lane gets a random \"location\" from the Marvel Universe, like the Savage Land, the Negative Zone, etc. and these change the way some cards operate, apply buffs, or debuffs and many more - you get the idea.\\n\\nDeckbuilding becomes an exercise in finding good card combos + anticipating possible interactions between your deck and the locations you will encounter each match. I love this little mechanic because it makes some of the cards you get at the beginning, that have no abilities, stay useful because they can perform consistently over more location effects or do not require much synergy with the rest of your deck to make an impact.\\n\\nAdditionally, there is a \"snap\" mechanic where each player may up the ante at any point in the match, if they feel confident they are about to win they can increasing the possible rank reward or loss that happens at the end of every ranked match - and any player that feels like they\\'ve got a slim chance to win can retreat and avoid having to take the larger risk.\\n\\nEach player bets a cube to start, if one player snaps, they up the wager to 2 cubes, and if both players snap then each of them is betting 4 cubes which gives 8 total to the winner while the other player loses 8.\\n\\nThe number of cubes you have determines what league you are in. I have 31 cubes - silver league. Going up to ladder gives more and better rewards. There are lots of daily missions and other ways to progress in the game - I don\\'t really think anyone needs to drop any money on this game to have fun, unless they would like to progress a bit faster, or support the developers. \\n\\nThe monetization seems to be pretty fine, in my opinion.\\n\\nThe game is still in Early Access, so there are no unranked modes yet, no draft mode, no co-op, or ways to play single player or privately with friends - but it only makes sense for these things to be added in the future.\\n\\nI am going to be playing this game a lot, I think.. haha\\n\\nGive it a go!\\n\\nNOMINATED FOR STEAM AWARD - BEST \"ON THE GO\" GAME 2022',\n",

       "  'review': 'I don\\'t know how to feel about this game.\\n\\nThe gameplay is very fun and the cards look great, especially in 3D!\\n\\nBut the card acquisition and monetization model is just something I cannot get behind...\\nInitially, a non-card pack card game sounds great! You get all cards by naturally playing and everyone is happy.\\nSadly, it doesn\\'t work out that way.\\n\\n[h1]Card acquisition:[/h1]\\nThey give you new cards extremely frequently at the beginning, which makes it easy to start, but it slows down pretty quickly and becomes more and more demoralizing. After a certain point, new cards aren\\'t even guaranteed anymore. From a new card every 8 levels, you go to having a 50% chance to get a new one every 12, then 25%. This, combined with the \"pools\" system they use to sort cards by, makes entering a new pool with few cards extremely frustrating, as entering a new pool makes you face opponents with cards you\\'ve never seen before, but would also like to play.\\n\\nThe card acquisition is entirely random, although there is a \"token shop\" in which you can buy cards for 1000 tokens. For reference, if you don\\'t spend any money and only do the daily missions, you can get 1000 tokens in about a month. A month. One new card of your choice. Per month. This sort of system makes it a giant drag to try out new decks, because you have to either be really lucky on the random card acquisiton track or get one guaranteed card a month, but you need 3 for the deck you want to try.\\n\\nThis idea that having a unique collection by random card acquisiton seems to backwards to me. If they gave you a wildcard instead, most people won\\'t spend it on the same thing! Some will prefer to spend theirs on a discard-synergetic card, others on reveal-based cards. But only being given a choice once per month feels exhausting.\\n\\nDon\\'t even get me started on series 4 or 5 cards. You can\\'t even dream on getting your hands on one of those if you don\\'t have all of the previous pools completed (without being insanely lucky). There\\'s a 2.5%/0.25% of that happening. And then it\\'s probably one you don\\'t even want. Them being in the token shop for 3000/6000 tokens (which would take upwards of 6 months (!!!)) to acquire at a chance of 37.5% of appearing just adds insult to injury. I\\'d love to try out some of the series 4 or 5 cards, they seem very interesting, but I will likely not get the chance to within the next half a year.\\n\\n[h1]Monetization:[/h1]\\nI honestly don\\'t have much against the season passes. They seem like great value.\\nAlthough I hope they dial it back a bit with the \"overtunedness\" of the featured cards given in them. Silver Surfer and Zabu especially warp the meta so much by themselves, that if you missed that season, you will likely have a worse experience because of it. Nerfs for them were already announced, so I hope those reign them in a bit within the coming weeks. The upcoming season pass with MODOK seems like a much better power level, but still a fun card in a certain archetype.\\n\\nOutside of that, the bundles they sell are either a couple bucks and decent value, or extremely expensive, to the points of spending more than a AAA game on a single card variant.\\n\\nThese kinds of whale bundles don\\'t even make me [i]consider[/i] buying it with those ludicrous prices. If they were halved, maybe. Then it seems like great value. But most of the time it\\'s just credits + gold value added together, which really isn\\'t a good deal at all for a bundle.\\nAlso the bundles of the recent month didn\\'t have any collector\\'s tokens included, which makes it twice as hard to buy any of them, even if I wanted to.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\nI really enjoy this game. The gameplay side of it is great. The different locations mix up the gameplan a decent bit and you can interact with your opponent well enough. (although them owning series 4/5 cards makes me very sad very quickly)\\nThe rant(s) above hold it back so much though, that I cannot in good conscience recommend it right now.\\nIf those problems:\\n- Random (not guaranteed) card acquisiton\\n- Slow card acquisiton\\n- Impossible to get ahold of recently released cards\\n- Not really great for value expensive bundles\\n- Bundles not containing tokens\\nThen I can and will recommend it, because it is in spite of them still fun.\\n[i](but just more frustrating currently)[/i]',\n",

       "  'review': 'When I first died in this game I was killed by a savage grunt called Krosh the Chop. He killed me in an outpost when i was fighting 4 captains at the same time. So he became a captain. I was mad so I decided to hunt him down but when I went to his nemesis mission he absolutely destroyed me because fighting savages in this game gives you cancer. With all that rage I decided to go after him for the final time. I interrogated a worm and learned that.. Krosh will instantly die to fire. I always fought him next to hundreds of grog barrels but never decided to shoot one. So I find Krosh and lure him to a grog barrel and shoot it. He burns to death. \\n\\nWhen I was going to Shelob\\'s cave in Cirith Ungol a familiar orc screamed \"ranger!\" It was Krosh again. He had cheated death but he was different this time. Instead of being called Krosh the Chop he was now called Krosh the Flame of War. He was wielding burning axes, his face was burnt and he was immune to fire this time. Sadly for him I had just learned how to kill savages so I used my new skills on him. He was not a strong target.\\n\\nAfter 30 In-Game hours I get a quest about killing a necromancer. When I arrived in Minas Mithil to kill the necromancer I see a familiar Orc between all those level 50 orcs i slayed recently. An orc that I used to mourn. A level 8 orc to be exact. Instead of attacking the necromancer i decide to see who this guy is. Turns out he is the one and only, Krosh the Flame of War. But this time instead of killing him I decide to recruit him. I hit him twice and he breaks. I recruit him and he joins my ranks as a level 14 captain. \\n\\nI train him and send him to fight pits for him to level up. Surprisingly he is very good at slaying anyone thats twice his level. I force him to murder all other captains in my ranks even the ones that sent me gifts. It was all going well until he came across Az-Agur War Master. A level 62 Olog. It was a very close battle but sadly Az Agur crushed Krosh under his giant mace. I kill Az Agur as soon as Krosh fell. I attempt to revive Krosh but I fail.. \\n\\nIn the loving memory of Krosh the Flame of War aka Krosh the Chop. May he rest in flame.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is perfect to me, here\\'s why: \\n\\nAfter I had gotten the ability to recruit enemy captains, I saw there was an achievement to shame an Assassin Captain until they become deranged. I attempted this with one called Dûsh. The second time I saw him, his title was rebranded to \"Dûsh the Shamed\" and he told me how terrible his life was now and how all the other Orcs were laughing at him, after which I fought him and shamed him again. The next time I saw him he became \"Dûsh the Unshamed\" and told me how he reveled in the title and embraced it and Orcs respected him more, he became even more powerful than he was at first, and I got a sense of comradery and respect for Dûsh. I chose to shame him again. \\n\\nThe next time I saw Dûsh the achievement I desired popped up, except this time Dûsh wasn\\'t speaking anymore, he was just making noises that sounded like a cartoon airplane stalling in the air (which made me laugh everytime I heard them, though now I realize they may have been his way of expressing his suffering). This is when I recruited him to be one of my captains. After some short time, he betrayed me. I had it coming. I deserved it. I thought I\\'d be able to recruit him again, except this time he had Iron Will, which meant he was unrecruitable and couldn\\'t be friendly ever again. It was either I shame him again, or him and I fight to the death. Not being able to repeat the same mistake I made already, I thought to myself \"So this is it, old friend\" and fought him. I won. Defeating him gave me a very powerful legendary although the price was far from worth it. I just wanted Dûsh back. \\n\\nAll of this isn\\'t part of the game\\'s story, it\\'s unscripted, it\\'s made up from randomly generated logic-branches of code that is nearly guaranteed to be impossible to get for anyone else, let alone my other playthroughs. The story Dûsh and I shared is special, it\\'s our story. I\\'m sorry it had to come to this, Dûsh. Forgive me, old friend',\n",

       "  'review': 'Middle-earth: Shadow of War is one of my favorite games of all time for one massive, outstanding reason.\\n\\nThe Nemesis System\\n\\nTo this date, I have yet to encounter anything as dynamic, fun, unpredictable, and exciting in a story driven combat game as the Nemesis System.  I have over 300 hours in Shadow of War, and out of that 200 hours were spent after I had completed the main campaign and 2 DLCs, completing every collectible and questline.  200 hours after the game was essentially \"completed\".\\n\\nThe experience of how your character interacts with the uruk enemies and how the enemies interact with you and each other is simply spectacular.  An example out of dozens I could give:  I return to Nurnen after several tours of duty in the other provinces, holding off numerous sieges and having to replenish and restructure my army\\'s ranks.  Upon my return, I face an all out insurrection in my ranks.  Three of my captains and a warchief all decide to betray me in a coordinated ambush to start a full-on UPRISING against me.  In the process, they bring one of my still loyal captains out and kill him in front of me.  In total, I\\'ve just lost 5 captains in an instant and gained 4 new enemies.  The next 2-3 hours were spent systematically hunting down every one of these traitors and punishing them in different ways.\\n\\nOne I outright killed in the first battle.  He got off easy.  One I forcibly re-recruited and demoted.  The other 2 I shamed into absolute despair.  One\\'s mind broke and I killed him, only for him to cheat death and return for more punishment.  The last one I forcibly recruited so I could execute him by making his head explode.  Through all this, I put the fear of Mordor through the rest of my ranks, and there has yet to be another uprising like that since.\\n\\nThe orcs (uruks and ologs) remember everything that happens to them.  They remember if you threw them off a cliff or burned them.  They remember up to a point how many times they\\'ve killed you or how many times you\\'ve had to run from them.  They even call each other by name and have rivalries and alliances within their own ranks.  Sometimes a warchief will step down from his high place to defend one of his favorite bodyguards.  Sometimes an assassin will track you from one province to another and ambush you when you least expect it.\\n\\nAnd the best part?  None of this was scripted.  All of this happened after the main campaign was long, long over.  The Nemesis System rewards the creative and adventurous player with amazing encounter after another.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a fan of Lord of the Rings fighting and stealth games.\\n\\nIf you like exciting and interesting AI enemies with personality and unpredictable behaviors.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a sick bastard who enjoys killing, torturing, and mind controlling the evil.\\n\\nLook no further.  Buy Shadow of War.',\n",

The full story is about 5 pages long and occured over roughly 4 hours of gameplay, so I'm opting for list format here. Note: A 'Death Threat' draws an orc out of hiding and increases their loot, but levels them up considerably. 'Shaming' lowers their level and makes them easier to recruit/convert to your side. Okay here we go...\\n\\n1) I recruited an orc assassin named Zugor the Kingslayer\\n2) I also recruited an olog-hai tank named Az-Adar the Pit Fighter\\n3) They became blood brothers (super-duper orc best friends)\\n4) Az-Adar became my favorite fighter\\n                ...fast forward to good part...\\n5) I decide to do an ambush mission for orc xp.\\n6) The ambush grows out of control (at this point it's me, 3 friendly captains, 3 enemy captains, plus armies)\\n7) Az-Adar shows up (Yay, help!)\\n8) Az-Adar betrays me (F**k)\\n9) Zugor teams up with Az-Adar (Double f**k)\\n10) I kill Az-Adar, Zugor is now royally ticked off.\\n11) I defeat and shame Zugor, Zugor flees (battle ends)\\n12) I send Zugor a death threat\\n13) Zugor is now Zugor the Unashamed (Legendary stats + a new culty look)\\n14) Zugor kills me\\n16) I send Zugor another death threat\\n17) I defeat and shame Zugor (He flees)\\n18) I track down and ambush Zugor (with the intent to convert him back)\\n19) Az-Adar (no longer dead and a legendary badass as well) shows up mid-battle as an undead abomination (Zugor's culty new outfit apparently granted him Dr. Frankenstein powers).\\n20) I kill Zugor\\n21) Zombie Az-Adar is now super ticked off and gains crazy health and damage\\n22) Epic 'Big Boss Battle' fight scene ensues\\n23) I defeat and shame Zombie Az-Adar\\n24) Zombie Az-Adar flees, but loses “Iron-Will” (I can mind control him again)\\n25) I ambush Zombie Az-Adar a final time\\n26) I recruit Zombie Az-Adar with mind control\\n27) I use Zombie Az-Adar to take over the entire region and kill everything\\n28) I promote Zombie Az-Adar to Overlord\\n\\nTL;DR: Two randomly generated orc NPCs made a better story than the entire campaign.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"What I love most about this game is that your encounter with every single orc has the potential to turn into an epic story.\\n\\nThere was this time when a berserker decided to bury his axe into my stomach, and he was promoted to a captain. Upon respawning, I decided to track him down and re-arrange his face with my sword. Our brief encounter ended with him being thrown off a ledge and falling to his death, I thought nothing of it at the time.\\n\\nLittle did I know I would encounter that same orc time after time again, the dude just wouldn't stay dead. Regardless of the injuries he sustained, he would always be back. I recognised this orc's admirable endurance for punishment, so naturally I decided to dominate him. \\n\\nHe served as my bodyguard for many hours, and we went on countless conquests together. We attacked and defended forts, cut down enemy captains whilst adding others to my army. This orc began as a grunt, and has risen through the ranks, becoming a captain, an epic captain, and finally a legendary warchief. His bloodlust seemed endless, and unfortunately that was the case.\\n\\nRecently I was wandering around Gorgoroth and tracking down an enemy captain. The fight was brutal but eventually his head was separated from his body, and his supporters fled. I was low on health and learned a valuable lesson moments after as my favourite orc decided to betray me.\\n\\nPerhaps it was my fault, I'd aided this orc in all his encounters and made sure he was victorious. I assigned him as a warchief, helped him become legendary, and inadvertently deluded him into thinking he could take on the Bright Lord.\\n\\nHis followers were slaughtered, and I regretfully executed the masterpiece I had created. Or did I? Perhaps he survived his fatal injuries like all the other times. If so, I look forward to introducing him to my Drake.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Is Shadow of War worth buying in 2021?[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Short Answer: YES!![/b]\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238331578\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232829285\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2265216731\\n\\n\\n[h1]Shadow of War is one of the most enjoyable game I have ever played[/h1] \\nEven after all these years I still go back to play it again once in a while. This game doesn't end when the story is over. It's absolutely worth getting, especially on sale. The online portion is still played by many. It’s not pvp though so don't expect that. The Online conquest is a sort of pve game mode but the forts which you can attack are set up by actual people, so you'll never really find the same setup all the time. You can send your overlord on an online pit fight or you fight against other people’s fortresses that they've stocked with, usually, their best orcs. Online vendetta is similar but is more like missions where you are going after an orc from other players’ game who has killed them. You can also defeat and recruit orcs from other players forts. The same way, if any of your precious orc unfortunately dies in any of these online conquests you will lose them for good.\\n\\n[h1]The Nemesis System and combat gameplay are what keep me coming back[/h1] \\nThe combat is similar to the likes of Assassins Creed and the Batman Arkham games but much better in my opinion. The abilities, combos etc are really fluid and satisfying. It’s not just hack and slash, you have to use your brain before going after different types of orcs. Higher tier Orcs will have multiple immunities, rages and strengths along with certain weaknesses. You can have to exploit them in your advantage, by tracking down a Worm. For example, there are orcs who are immune to arrows, executions, fire etc. Fortress captains tend to have more strengths than weaknesses, so you have to be careful with that. You have to plan your ambush/attack and prepare before joining a fight.\\nThanks to the unique, intricate & superbly designed content generator named ‘Nemesis system’ I never got bored at finding interesting AI orcs with personality, unpredictable behaviour and catchy, comedic/provocative dialogues. Not to mention certain death defying orcs who just would not stay dead. No matter how much punishment they go through they still sometimes resurrect and ambush. You might think that the best thing to do here is dominate and recruit them but they can still betray you later!! The Nemesis System also rewards creative and adventurous players with new story lines and breath-taking encounters one after another. The system even turns some orcs into truly memorable enemies.\\n\\n[h1]Furthermore[/h1]\\nThe game’s visuals and landscapes are sublime. The story can easily rival the masterpiece that is The Lord of the Rings trilogy. This story driven game also has some intriguing plot twists that is worth mentioning.\\nThe in game unlockable gear sets including rings, bows, swords, armors, cloaks, daggers, hammers, masks are quite remarkable. I didn’t have to grind very hard to get them. \\nWhile playing the game I became addicted to fighting Orcs, hunting them down, confronting those that betrayed me or killed my Captains. After levelling up and acquiring new sets of skills/abilities I felt a sense of unique and divine Godly power….it’s hard to describe with words. I also formed a bond with Talion not just to avenge the slaughtering of his whole family but through his morals and belief in a better world – a better Mordor.\\n\\n[h1]DLC[/h1]\\nThere are two DLC available which are slightly different as you play different characters (Eltariel & Baranor) in them. You get Nemesis expansions: a number of new Tribes, new orcs, tribal weapons, legendary gear sets, new fortress & regions and obviously new missions. They tie this game’s story nicely with the earlier story of Shadow of Mordor.\\n\\n\\n[h1] Any gripes?[/h1]\\nAlthough certain aspects of the game like brutal killing, torturing, and mind controlling the evil can be fun for many people but might be little too much for certain faint hearted ones 😂\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nIn my honest opinion, even if you are not a big fan of Lord of the Rings or not much familiar with it, it’s a pretty safe bet you'll get your money’s worth in Shadow of War definitive edition.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Genuinely one of the best games I\\'ve ever played. It starts out a little boring, since the only thing to do aside from the main story is killing orcs, but once you reach Act II, the game really picks up, since it allows you to have many interactions with the same orc captains, and form relationships with them.\\n\\nThe combat is fluid and fun enough to keep the typical person entertained through Act I, but it\\'s not really what the core of the game is. The core of the game is the Nemesis System. Basically what the Nemesis System does is that when an enemy kills you, they get more powerful, but more than that, they remember that they killed you. Not to mention that your enemies can occasionally cheat death if you kill them, and they\\'ll remember that you killed them, so they\\'ll come back with a figurative axe to grind and a literal axe in their head. I feel like the best aspects of the Nemesis System could best be demonstrated through stories.\\n\\nOne of my late-game nemeses was Zoruk Runnybowels. Yes, his name referenced his diarrhea, trust me, he was more intimidating than he sounds. He was the bane of my existence throughout Gorgoroth, but eventually I got together a team of 3 of captains that worked for me, and sent them all to murder Zoruk dead. We succeeded! Then he cheated death almost immediately, and went right back to kicking my ass, except now it was personal for him.\\n\\nHe killed me, and that\\'s when I discovered that he had killed me so many times he got promoted to Warchief. I could draw him out in a warchief mission, but instead I continued building my army. I eventually had an army whom\\'s strength I trusted, and we went to capture the fortress. This was where I finally put an end to Zoruk Runnybowels. We captured the first of 4 victory points, guarded by Zoruk, and he began running to protect the next point. I would not allow this.\\n\\nI shadow-strike pulled him back to me, and we participated in a 1v1 battle. I actually even killed some of the grunts who came to help me, because I felt that would be unfair to Zoruk, and I wanted him to know he lost. In a video game. I felt like I had something to prove to an NPC.\\n\\nSince we\\'d already captured the victory point, no grunts came to help Zoruk either, and I managed to bring him down to zero health. He fell on his knee, and I was prepared for the coming QTE to land the finishing blow, when he started giving a speech. I don\\'t recall exactly what he said here, but I\\'m just gonna say he quoted Thanos and said \"You should have gone for the head.\" He got back up, revealing he had the Death Defying trait, and by now he had adapted to most of my different types of attacks, so he kicked my ass.\\n\\nI tried a second attempt to capture the fortress, and things went similarly at first. We captured the victory point, I got a 1v1 duel with Zoruk, but instead of bringing him down to zero health, once he was broken I grabbed him. Since we were in Gorgoroth, there was a river of lava running right down the streets of the fortress, so I tossed Zoruk into the lava.\\n\\nI went on to capture the fortress, and finally breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Zoruk was finally gone... Until he cheated death again, coming back as Zoruk the Flame of War. But that\\'s a story for another day.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Prologe:\\nHoly Moly, this game. Where do I even start.\\n\\nAt the very beginning, I guess. \\nLast weekend I decided to get Shadow of Mordor in the Humble Bundle. It was cheap and I wanted to look into it for a long time. I liked the idea of the nemesis system and wanted to experience it myself. Maybe I would even like it? Oh past-me, little did you know...\\nI ran through the game in like 15h. The nemesis system was awsome, but the game was way too easy after a few hours of playing. I didnt need to prepare for fights anymore and almost everyone standing in my way. The only hard fights were the ones with my nemesis. So I read some reviews about Shadow of War. \\nI read about the Nemesis Difficulty, the Improvements that were made and the much less clumsy controlls. Building an army with the dominated orks and capturing forts and regions?? Sign me up!\\nSo, while finishing the last few quests of SoM I was already downloading SoW in the background.\\n-----------------\\nThe Nemesis System:\\nThis game is EVERYTHING SoM wanted to be, and way more.\\nI am playing Shadow of War on Nemesis Difficulty, and I would everyone advise to do so. Here is why:\\nYou will get smacked around, you will get burned, poisoned, killed A FRIGGIN LOT.\\nBUT... it will force you to use the whole range of the nemesis system to strike down your enemies.\\nYou will need to study them, you have to outmove them and use every little weakness they have. You will need allies, you will need them at the right place in the right time, with the right weapons, damage types and abilities. This game became the most fun and addicting strategy-assassins-creed-batman-mixup, with probbably the most dynamic game world I have every experienced.\\nThe Orcs and Uruks will fight against you, yes, but whats way more important and amazing to watch: They will fight against each other for ranks, they will ally with each other, betray each other... if you give them the time and the space they will restructure their whole army from within without your help. Its an completely independent eco system of individuals. Every orc has its own unique characteristics and cant be compared to any other one. They are procedural  generated, yes, but it just doesnt feel like they are. Some you will hate, some you will like... and there even will be some who you are willing to save in a battle, because they are potential allies (or are already yours) and you dont want to lose them. You can steer the outcome of some of their fights, eliminate or recruit the orcs, give them orders to kill someone or spy on their commander... you can never controll the whole system, and thats exactly what it makes so unpredictable and exciting. This game offers the most interesting version of chess that I have every played in my life.\\nThere is so much more to say, I cant cover every part of the system. It just would consume to much time. Just one more thing: IMO this system is revolutionary for videogames of the future. It will be hard to go back to generic boss fights and boring and forced encounters in other games. \\n\\n-----------------\\nThe Gameplay:\\n\\nNot only the dynamics of the nemesis system are amazing (even tho its the very best part of the game, not even a question IMO), but also the development of your character. The skills that are available to you give you full controll over the playstyle you want to use. You want to go full berserk? Sure! You are more of a stealthy player and want to kill you foes without someone noticing? We you covered! You want to rely on your trusted allies and buff them, or ride beasts and kill with their help or from their back, or you want to power up your spectral form to smash everyone around you with special and elemental attacks, or you are more of a far fighter and would like to strike them down with your bow and arrow? Do whatever you like! Oh, you want to do all of this in combination? Well, you need some more levels for that but... hey, what gives, knock yourself out, mate!\\n\\nThe freedom this game offers gameplaywise is sheer incredible.\\n\\nDid I mention that you can buff and differ your attacks and playstyle with looted weapons, armor and other items, too?\\nOh, and if you like one item in particular... well, just upgrade it to your level and take it with you into the next battle!\\nIn this game a whole lot of micromanagement is needed... and I love every last bit of it!\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\nEpiloge:\\nYou want to hear something funny? It took me about 25h tho conquer the first fort... not because it was so incredibly hard, but because there is so much to do, and if you are willing to do all of it this game probably offers hundreds of hours of playtime. Well, what can I say... It suck me in completely.\\nEverything you just read happened and is offered by the game till the middle of Act II (there are 4). There is probably much more to come. After the first conquer the map opened up again... and it blew my head straight off.\\nBuy it, experience it, love it. Surely it worth its 40 Bucks, but somethimes its on sale for about 15. Thats one hell of a deal. \\n\\nThank you for reading this far and I hope you liked this hyped up review. \\nThere would be so much to say, but for now I am done and I think I need a shower. \\nOver and out.',\n",

       "  'review': 'As an avid Tolkien reader and a lover of WB Arkham-style combat, and being someone who really enjoyed Shadow of Mordor, I have a lot of conflicting feelings about this game.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed it and I think the game + the DLCs at $40 is worth the value.\\n\\nWhat the game does right:\\n- Combat is smooth and fun.\\n- New abilities that make fights feel a bit more diverse and creates situations where you really have to think your way through a Captain fight.\\n- The design, graphics, sounds, and music are fantastic.\\n- New armors and weapons/new gear sets.\\n- Orcs all have a ton of personality, and encounters feel very organic.\\n- The Nemesis system adds just the right level of challenge and personal investment when you get a really tough Captain.\\n- Skins which let you visually appear as other characters.\\n- Eltariel (this might be an unpopular opinion)\\n\\nWhat the game doesn\\'t do so well:\\n- While orcs have a ton of personality, a lot of them are too silly, and in some places, completely lore-breaking.  I realize that the intention is to be fun, but a lot of orc personalities really kill the feeling of dread and anticipation in finding that next brutal Captain.\\n- It\\'s hard to tell, but the game seems like it could still use some optimizing, even in 2021.  With less than half of my VRAM being used, I still see frame drops in places where it seems like there shouldn\\'t be.\\n- The story itself is rather short and not quite satisfying to get through.  In particular, the DLCs are very short with sequences that are disappointingly easy to get through.\\n- After awhile, the game feels like all you\\'re doing is micromanaging and min/maxing your Captains to grind through the endgame content (which is very repetitive).\\n- I don\\'t agree with some of the creative liberties the writers took with the story of Lord of the Rings.  The attempt to weave Talion\\'s/Eltariel\\'s/Baranor\\'s stories into the story of LOTR itself does not always integrate well, and at times is just a complete deviance from Tolkien\\'s writing.  The writers definitely know their lore, but the decisions on how to create a new storyline from it just fall flat at times.\\n- The story sequences which should provide the biggest amount of buildup and amount of closure all feel rushed and unsatisfying.  There were several characters throughout the story who I wanted to see more of, and they just sort of disappeared without a mention when their short arcs were over.  \\n- The loot box fiasco at launch I think hamstrung this game from the start.  WB\\'s inability to read the \"climate change\" of gaming at the time, and not learn from the boycotts that had already happened against other games caused (what I believe to be) poor decisions to be made from a product prioritization perspective.  The loot boxes gave nothing of any real value and caused launch to make this game feel like a generic army builder mobile game.\\n\\n\\nSo.....do I recommend it?  If you\\'re a Middle Earth fan, it\\'s gotta be a yes, but get it on sale.  It\\'s still incredibly satisfying to hop on, slaughter hundreds of orcs, and call it a day.  If you\\'re a Tolkien fan and are looking for a really solid lore-friendly story....I\\'ll say your mileage may vary, but I still think you\\'ll have fun with it.  For all the gripes and critiques I have, I still think I\\'ll be playing this one from time to time until the next one comes out (if it does).  Various difficulty modes do help in offering variety in gameplay experience, but they can\\'t really make up for the less-savory parts of the story and dialogue.',\n",

I would never spend 80$ for it but I don\\'t think I\\'d spend 80$ on any game nowadays. But I do recommend the game.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played Shadow of Mordor and liked it, you should play this game. It\\'s (obviously) a lot like the first game, except everything is better. It\\'s a lot more fun, there\\'s more stuff to do, the gameplay feels even nicer, the nemesis system feels more important, fortress assaults are tons of fun (although they do get tedious, more on that later). \\n\\nIf you\\'ve never played the first game (this is a sequel), then it doesn\\'t really matter. A lot of what you do in this game is similar to what you do in the first game. The story of the first game was more compelling to me in the first game but it doesn\\'t really matter. They do a fairly good job of putting you in context.\\n\\nThe first thing I would like to address is the story... I love Tolkien\\'s universe. I love the lore. Even then I really cannot claim to be that savvy about it, I read some of the books, know a few things about the ones I haven\\'t but I can\\'t claim to know that much about it. Even then, everything about the story in this game feels off, to the point where not long after starting it, I found it almost cringy. At some point I was almost frustrated with it. Truth is, this is not much more than an elaborate fan fiction.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Monolith wanted to make a cool game and decided to bend everything else around it to make a good game. No matter how fucked the lore is in this game, I think they actually did a pretty good job in that regard.\\n\\nIt might be an odd comparison but it reminds me of \"Black Flag\". You know, the Assassin\\'s Creed game that everybody refers to using its subtitle because the only reason it\\'s an assassin\\'s creed game is to profit off of the franchise\\'s name? It was a pirate game and it did an excellent job at that... So why make it have anything to do with Assassin\\'s Creed? That\\'s a bit how I feel about Shadow of War, honestly.\\n\\nI feel like there\\'s so little that actually makes sense lore-wise that they might as well have made their own game. They were clearly not limiting themselves seeing how they warped the lore to suit their game so just imagining what they could have produced if they weren\\'t tied to something that already exists. I see it as playing it really safe by using a well-known franchise.\\n\\nThe target audience is very clear too. The depiction of everything is based off of Peter Jackson\\'s movies. Things are made to be very epic and gritty and cool and full of action. Things like the Eye of Sauron or Sauron\\'s armor are taken directly from the movies as well. The game is targeted towards people who saw the movies, liked it and want some sort of expansion on them while being able to murder orcs.\\n\\nNow, as frustrating as I found all of this at first... They did a pretty damn good job at it. The protagonist feels super bad ass, you unlock new abilities that expands how you fight, what you can do and make you look even cooler. You\\'ll even want to switch between abilities depending on what you\\'re doing or who you\\'re fighting. Having an immortal ultra bad-ass protagonist makes no fucking sense lore-wise but it feels cool so whatever. When you accept that the game is not cannon at all and just appreciate the exaggerated action and speeches and all, it\\'s fun.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen people talk about bugs and honestly in 40-60 hours of play time I\\'ve had my share as well: Getting stuck in invisible collisions, falling out of world, game soft-locking when a captain\\'s talking etc. It\\'s annoying but I\\'ve seen a lot worse. I think that people complaining about this don\\'t realize how elaborate all of this is and how insane the idea of producing a bug-free game is. You have no idea what the game was earlier in development and I can tell you that the end result is outstanding, all things considered.\\n\\nThe level of polish is actually insane. Not being able to skip a lot of the cutscenes is sort of frustrating but even after playing for so long... I\\'ve rarely heard the same lines more than once. This is incredible to me and always made me curious to hear what the next orc was going to say. Even the speeches the Overlords make, how their lines change if they\\'ve killed you once or more, if they got promoted etc. It makes the game feel very alive. It does something that so many games fail to do: It makes you feel like your character and the characters around him are real and have personalities.\\n\\nYou also have to appreciate the quality of the PC release. Just like Shadow of Mordor, the PC port/version is so well made. There are tons of options for graphics settings, the game is well optimized (despite people complaining it runs poorly), the way Render vs Display resolution is implemented is one of the best I\\'ve seen on any game. There\\'s an option that dynamically adjusts render resolution to maintain a specific frame rate and it works very well.\\n\\nI did not have any problems with micro-transactions because I didn\\'t buy them. You absolutely don\\'t need them, the game is not that hard and it doesn\\'t really take that long to reach max level. The fort assaults are super fun but near the end of the game that\\'s essentially all you do (that\\'s what everyone is referring to when they say the game is grindy). I have to admit I had fun up until the last 4 ones or so. It was getting frustrating, long, I was tired of the game \"pausing\" to let captains speak one by one when there are 10 of them and the \"true ending\" was disappointing.\\n\\nThere are already a lot of people who have talked about all these things in great details. What I can say is that gameplay wise, the game is fun and will be fun for a good 40-50 hours, which is more than I wanted anyway.\\n\\nLove it or hate it, it\\'s another one of those action-adventure game except it\\'s very well-made, well-polished, the interactions with orcs are fun, gameplay is fun. Get it when it\\'s cheaper and includes all the DLCs, the expansions are 20$ each for very little content right now, I haven\\'t played them myself and honestly can\\'t be bothered for that price.',\n",

       "  'review': '[u]What I liked: [/u]\\n[list]\\n    [*]More depth in the Nemesis System\\n    [*]Sieges and Dragons\\n[/list]\\n[u]What I didn’t like: [/u]\\n[list]\\n    [*] End game is pointless and boring\\n    [*]Loot aspect was weak in design\\n[/list]\\n[u]More in depth: [/u]\\n[list]\\n    [*]The main concern me and I know everyone who wants to buy the game but hasn’t. Does the game still have the lingering effects of the pay to win at launch? I can say no; the grind isn’t any longer than the first game. So if you are worried about that don’t be.\\n\\n    [*]So a lot of the new systems they added were meant for people to buy like money, orcs and loot. I never had problems of finding orcs, loot or money. If you just play the game normally, you’ll never run into issues. The only way these can be grindy is if you go in the “end game” that will require a lot of investment in maximizing your stuff, but the game isn’t that good to warrant playing it for beyond the main game imo.\\n \\n    [*]Now onto the actual game, the combat is basically the same with some new powers thrown in the mix. You also have a hammer as a ranged weapon if you want. The loot that you get changes how you look and later in the game you go, the cooler they look.  The sets that you get and how to upgrade them were really stupid. They only level up at set levels and by recruiting a certain type of orc. It’s not really worth the hassle as the bonuses aren’t really that great. Don’t expect Warframe, Diablo level quality here. The progression is very basic and personally feels lazy.\\n\\n    [*]The nemesis system is improved from the first one, more variation, more stats, types of bosses, and easier to read what they are. This system really makes the fighting and banter feel personalized and forces different tactics to overcome them. I don’t think I ever heard the same dialogue used more than once or twice. They did a good job here.\\n\\n    [*]The other main reason I was interested in this game was the sieges. The main campaign gives you I think 5 or 6 sieges to do, with some defending thrown in there. Here you pick your army commanders, up to 5, pick what you’re taking into battle, like what type of catapults, archers and soldiers. If you time it right you can take out enemy commanders to weaken their base like no alarms, weaker walls or no catapults. They gave the right amount to play because after you beat the game this is all you do. The seiges are somewhat more spectacle than a real seige. You still do basically all the work.\\n\\n    [*]The main reason for the paid content was for after you beat the game. Here you get progressively harder sieges that require you to recruit higher level orcs, get better gear and spend a lot of currency that is no longer buyable to help you out here. I did like 3 sieges before I gave up on the boring grind, the game isn’t that good to warrant playing it that much.\\n\\n    [*]Overall the story is weak and I skipped over most of it, the combat is that batman arkham style that you will either love or hate. The improved nemesis system and siege combat with some looting that wasn’t all bad, was fun enough for the time I played. The end game and loot progression felt tacked on and is a huge boring grind. If you didn’t like the first one, this won’t change your mind. Otherwise it’s fun dumb game to play and chop orcs with while you wait for another game to play.\\n\\n [/list]\\n\\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\\n[b]C [/b]\\n\\n[b]Paid: $17 [/b]\\n[b]Completed in: 29 hours [/b]\\n\\nGames similar I recommend: \\n[list]\\n    [*]Batman Arkham Series  [url=https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/208650]Arkham Knight review[/url]\\n    [*] Assassins Creed\\n    [*] The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt [url=https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/292030]review[/url]\\n [/list]',\n",

       "  'review': 'I was fighting with some PITA enemy captain who was immune to vault/execution/poison/flame. I was swarmed by minions and also got ambushed by 2 other enemy captains. I made a mistake and I was nearly killed but avoided death by the last chance mechanism. Just as I was going to strike the final blow, I mistakenly pressed spacebar and tried to vault over the goddamn captain. Not surprisingly, he pushed me off and immediately countered me. My health bar depleted to zero and I collapsed on my knees. Just as I was watching helplessly, him raising his spear to deliver the final blow, suddenly A GIANT TROLL appeared behind me, grabbed the enemy by his head, lifted him to waist level and just like the Mountain squashed the head of Oberyn Martell in GoT, my bodyguard, WHOM I DID NOT CALL UPON, painted me with the enemy\\'s bashed skull pieces and brains, alongside with blood.\\n\\nAs I got up, he turned to me and said \"I AM ALWAYS HERE WHEN YOU NEED ME BOSS, WHETHER YOU CALL ME OR NOT\".\\n\\nThat\\'s why I love this game. The amount of epic moments, the randomness, the fun, the humor and the gore. This game has an insane replay value, no encounter is the same as the previous one. They really nailed to create a really dynamic world and random encounters all throughout the game. \\n\\nThis is why I play this game when I need to blow off some steam, when I have limited time to play.

I did see some movies, and made some Gandalf memes in my days but that's all my interaction with this franchise.\\nHowever, LOTR games were always goddamn amazing in terms of actual gameplay, they managed to keep having a constant good and satisfying gameplay throughout all these years.\\n\\nI have to admit, i barely paid any attention to the story, and with me not having much knowledge about LOTR space, there's not much for me to say about it. I even skipped a big part of the cutscenes, well... except for Shelob's (:D)\\nIn SOW, you get some new weapons and skills, there are some new enemies, and overall the world is much much bigger, however, i would've preferred even more weapons and less skills, because at times, these new abilities feel like they were there just as an extra, something not necessary that tends to cause more annoyingness in the long run.\\nThe world or i should say, worlds, are very well crafted with unique beauty, each with its own charms, quirks, strategies.\\n\\nAt first i was put off by the game, maybe i was too accustomed to the previous game and was expecting the exact same thing. While there aren't major changes, there's some new UI stuff that might feel weird at first.\\nI'd say it has good hardware optimization overall. The game also works fine with a mouse but i'd really recommend you to play it with a controller, it's less confusing at times.\\n\\ntl;dr - Gameplay is solid, and you don't need to be a fan to enjoy it, you can have as little knowledge about this universe as you have of building a spaceship, and you will still get few dozen hours of fun out of it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'As a huge fan of Shadow of Mordor, and the middle earth universe in general, I have been waiting 3 years for the sequel to SOM to come out, and whilst its not a bad game (I actually think its better than SOM), I don\\'t feel that I can recomend it, at least now, based of the large number of issues I have with the game.\\n\\n\\nFirst of I will start with the positives\\n\\n+ The game is much larger in scope than SOM with more areas to explore (Five in total, compared to SOM\\'s two)\\n\\n+ A much better loot system that replaces the runes of the last game. There is now armor and weapons.\\n\\n+ A better story, which feels more Lord of the rings than SOM\\'s story\\n\\n+ More varied orcs with new attack patterns and new olog-hai (trolls)\\n\\n+ Large fortress battles\\n\\n+ A few new skills and improvements to the SOM formula, like auto picking up arrows and double jump\\n\\n\\nNow sadly onto the negatives, and I have alot of them :(\\n\\n- The game is very buggy at the moment and as far as I am aware there has not been a single patch released for the game on PC (I am not 100% sure)\\nTwice have I failed fortress assaults because my character has glitched into the enviroment and I am unable to move.\\n\\n- The maps are actually smaller than the ones in SOM (but the total mass of all 5 maps is bigger than the 2 in SOM) and they just arn\\'t very memorable. Appart from the forts which vary a bit, 4 of the 5 maps are basically the same, with different skins over the top. There are pretty much no memorable locations on any of the maps except the Minas Morgul map.\\n\\n- The controls still feel clunky, and the gamepad controls have too many actions on too few buttons. For example, on an XB1 controller, A is to sprint, jump, climb jump, roll, volt over an enemy and a few more moves. This means that when you are in combat you end up doing the wrong moves, like trying to volt an enemy instead of dodging an attack. There are also too many enemies at once and its pretty much impossible to attack a certain one, the game will just attack anything it wants.\\n\\n- Far too many reused assets. As a huge AC fan, I am used to seeing alot of reused assets going from game to game, and I don\\'t have a problem with reusing assets, as long as there is enough new stuff to make it feel fresh. The problem is that this game doesn\\'t have enough. \\nThe combat animations are 95% the same as SOM, the background music and combat music has been copied over from SOM, one of the 5 regions of the game is in the same region as one of SOM\\'s maps with alot of reused textures and models.\\nAs someone who played SOM for over 200 hrs between PC and Xbox, I have to say this game starts to feel stale way to fast.\\n\\n- The end cutscene is hidden behind a grindwall. To access the real ending of the game you are forced to defend your fortresses 20 times in a mode called \"shadow wars\" at the end of the main story. After 2 or 3 assults it starts to get boring real fast, and every single attack feels pretty much the same. Since it\\'s the end of the game there is nothing left to do except repeat the fortress assaults, and when there are bugs like the ones mentioned above it really starts to piss you off.\\n\\n- The loot boxes. Like I said above the ending of the game feels purposely hidden behind a grind wall to make the player want to buy loot boxes. There are also adverts all over the main menu and the pause menu and even pop-ups on the army screen telling you to \"buy\" new orcs from the market.  \\n\\n- Poor optimisation on lower end PCs. My Rig is running a 1080Ti, so I have not experienced this one first hand. That said, many friends running lower ends cards, as well as other reviews I have read say that the game doesn\\'t run that great on lower end PC\\'s. I wasn\\'t going to add this since it hasn\\'t effected me, but I decided to just to keep people informed.\\n\\n- Alot of the orcs use the same dialogue, which was never an issue in SOM (for me), and it makes alot of the enemies you face feel the same as other enemies you have already killed. I have run into 7 orcs during my playthrough which all have the same story about how they were bitten by a spider and they all look the same, with the same orc character model with a spider web stuck to their faces.\\n\\n- The orcs talk too much during sieges, let me explain what I mean. \\nLike in SOM, every time you run into a named orc from the nemesis system, the gameplay will pause and the orc will talk to you for 10 - 20 seconds, usually saying something about how hes going to kill you and eat your face. The problem I have is that when you attack an enemy fortress there are usually 6 warchiefs in charge of the fort that you will have to kill. Each warchief usually has 2 bodyguards, which means there are about 18 nemesis enemies in total in every fort. Every time you run into one they will start to talk to you, and there is nothing you can do while they talk to you for 10 - 20 seconds, and there is no way to skip it. This means that during every fortress assult you have to listen to 18 orcs telling their boring stories about how they are going to kill you. This really ruins the pace of the assults as they are ment to be huge scale battles with tonnes of enemies to kill, and having the game pause once every few seconds as you run into another orc captain really ruins the pace. Simply adding a skip dialogue button would fix this problem and I don\\'t know why the devs havn\\'t done this.\\n\\nTo summarize, I don\\'t think this is a bad game. I even think this is a better game than SOM. But sadly the game has too many problems and not enough new things for me to recommend it at the £45 / $60 price tag. If the game is patched and some of the issues are fixed I might change my review to a positive, but as of now I honestly cannot recommend this game.\\n\\nIm sorry if this review comes across as very negative, but its because I had really high hopes for this game and I want to see it succeed. It just has too many problems for me right now :(',\n",

I was searching my YouTube for videos to see when the trailer of the game appeared in front of me. I clicked it because i had already played Shadow of Mordor and knew the series. I was blasted away, i then watched more and more videos, clips from the story from the gameplay i didn't care. I was hyped up. In that moment, i decided... I wanted to play this game so god damn much, but at the time i didn't have the pc to support the game. I waited for 2 long years when at last on December 2019 i bought a new pc, and guess what game i bought and played first. Yep, Middle Earth Shadow of War. My favourite duo Celembrimbor and Talion were back to kick some ass. Oh boy the new and updated Nemesis system was just amazing. I kept playing the game for months on end i completed everything including all dlcs and achievements. 100% completion. Then for dozen more hours i was just wondering around the regions of Mordor killing everything in my path. I had so much fun with the orcs and their unique personalities. I want to replay it on Gravewalker difficulty. Yes I'm a masochist. I recommend it with closed eyes. Buy It.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So torn on this game. I loved it maybe 75% of the way through..once you reach the last act though it\\'s just the worst grind of a game with an incredibly unsatisfying ending.\\n\\nEverything written here is of my own opinion. Take it for what it is\\n\\nGameplay: The gameplay is great...for awhile. If you\\'ve played the first one, then you already know the Nemesis system is great and makes combat fluid. The only problem is now there\\'s just so many enemies on screen at one time it can be kind of craz and you might get blindsided/execute the wrong enemy. Just a little thing. In regards to the enemies, they get old fast. There are maybe 5 variations? And after the first 10 hours or so...the speeches that they give before they fight you are super annoying and unnecessary. Wish they would have added a skip option. \\nTowards the latter half, it is a grind of a game. And that\\'s not a bad thing, I love to grind out games and build up the character. But it didn\\'t feel fun after a while, even the side quests themselves felt boring and derivative.\\n\\nGraphics/Visuals: Game looks great, can\\'t complain.\\n\\nStory: Torn here as well. I loved the LOTR movies, and was excited to hear that they would be bringing back Talion and the lore for a 2nd run. The only problem is, by the 4th act they really dropped the ball. I won\\'t spoil it, but it just felt so unsatisfying as a resolution. It felt like they just rushed through it, through together a final act, added a HUGE grinding section of a game that can take HOURS to complete. and i mean HOURS. all to really just see this last scene and...you\\'re just left wondering \"...THAT\\'S the ending?\" Save yourself the trouble: stop playing after the end of Act III, and just watch the ending on YouTube. I honestly didn\\'t even finish the game after i realized what the end-game was. They REALLY want you to buy lootboxes...and while it isn\\'t necessary, it\\'s just annoying how much weight they put on the micro-transactions\\n\\nStarted out loving this game, now i can\\'t recommend it to another person for FULL price. if it\\'s on sale, then go for it. But i would definitely not pay full price like i did knowing what  i do now.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Man, this game is a mixed bag. If you’re expecting a game with even a shred of narrative decency, you’ll be sorely disappointed with what is essentially collectable orc Pokemon. The story is a garbage fire, the characters are as compelling as a bowl of lumpy rocks, and the progression system is entirely arbitrary. The real heart of Shadow of War is the orcs; dynamically generated characters who are absolutely bursting with personality. If not for them, Shadow of War would be an unbearable slog of poorly constructed narrative scraps which would make Tolkien roll over in his grave.\\n\\n[b]Characters and Story[/b]\\n\\nLike I mentioned above, the story is an absolute waste of time. I dreaded every single one of the mandatory and nonsensical story missions. For anyone who missed the last game, Shadow of Mordor ended with the sequel bait of building your army to confront the Dark Lord in Mordor, and this is exactly where Shadow of War picks up. Unfortunately, SoW addresses this mandate in the worst conceivable way. \\n\\nIn order to fight Sauron, Celebrimbor decides to craft a new ring of power. This is alright I guess, though the exact attributes of this ring are never fully discussed. I guess it just does what the normal ring does with the exception of being ‘less evil’. Naturally Talion/Celebrimbor immediately lose the ring to the new sexy shapeshifting Shelob, the giant fucking spider from the main Lord of the Rings Trilogy who apparently can magically teleport the wraith of Celebrimbor around for some reason. How can she do this? Who cares - look at those tits! She yoinks the ring and presumably just stares at it for a while before giving it back to Talion (all you have to do is ask for her to pretty please return it!). This introduction pretty much sets the standard for the rest of the game. Nothing makes any sense, nothing is explained, and there’s absolutely no narrative tension. \\n\\nI think the following interaction sums up the quality of the story pretty well. It happens just after entering the second act. Talion hears some funky noises coming from the forest and asks whats up. Celebrimbor explains that he’s hearing the forest of Carnan, and that Talion should just ignore it and keep branding orcs. Of course, you immediately head on over-\\n\\nCelebrimbor: “Yo Talion, don’t mess with the Spirit of Carnan. She’s an ancient protector of the forest who’s already pissed that orcs are using her pals as firewood. How about you just try and be nice for like 30 seconds.”\\n\\nTalion: “I bow to no vegetation.”\\n\\n*Proceeds to chop up non-hostile tree elementals for literally no reason*\\n\\nThis pretty much sums up the Celebrimbor-Talion relationship throughout the whole game. Celebrimbor says something that makes sense, Talion does the exact opposite. It’s as if Talion has the IQ of a piece of french toast (though the french toast probably has more personality). His character truly is insufferable - he’s either droning on about “the people of Gondor” or preaching shitty little monologues about “building an army” and saving the world. Absolutely no characterization here; I wish we could have played as wraith dad. \\n\\nThe other good characters are mostly just as bad. There’s an elf lady who does strong independent elf things, a sad soldier from Minas Ithil with abandonment problems, and an African-American gentlemen who just kind of pops in sometimes. Gollum also makes an obligatory appearance for a little while. Development is lacking overall.\\n\\nSome of the cutscenes are also very poorly done. I remember an instance early on when African-American gentlemen, Talion, and a group of Gondorian soldiers were to ambush a captain near a fighting pit. Besides the whole area being mysteriously devoid of orcs when the area was swarming with them just a few seconds before, the camera work was just awful. You get a close up shot of the captain and right behind him is a dude from Gondor, bow fully strung and aiming at the ambush point. What the heck WB? Things like this are very immersion breaking throughout the game.\\n\\n[b]Combat and Progression[/b]\\n\\nBasically Assassins Creed on crack. Pretty fun, no complaints here. This game lets you ride drakes. \\n\\nSkill progression is smooth and and doesn’t require a great deal of effort. I had almost everything unlocked before ending the second act. Their are some fun Celebrimbor lore challenges throughout the world where you relive (?) the wraith's past, but these don’t really give you much advantage other than a few gems and a skill point. There are also collectables dotted throughout the world which let you access lore on Shelob or open certain doors, but these are all optional. \\n\\nShadow of War also lets you equip armor and weapons for Talion, but this mostly consists of wearing a piece of gear for a little bit and then chucking it once a better piece pops up. Nothing really memorable here.\\n\\n[b]The Orcs[/b]\\n\\nThis is the main selling point for Shadow of War. Across the board orcs are fantastic. The nemesis system is vastly improved from the first game, allowing you to forge more meaningful stories with your own randomly generated orc buds. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions to watch your favorite brain damaged Olog with a flaming club lose a fight to some skinny dude with an explosive crossbow. The only thing that kept me playing this game is an unstoppable urge to brand all the Pokem- I mean captains in the area and see their quirky personalities. Much has been said about the dreaded fourth act, but if you’re down for branding orcs for an eternity it’s not so bad. Building and conquering fortresses is great, and it's really fun to watch your hard earned orc children blossom into warlords of their own. Generally a great experience in the orc department.\\n\\n[b]Loot Boxes[/b]\\n\\nThey exist, but why would you buy them if the most fun part of the game is collecting orcs? It’s like paying to be sad. \\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\\nPick up Shadow of War on sale for 30 bucks in 2018. The orcs are great and the combat is fun, but the narrative hernia is a real bummer. Come for the orcs, stay for the orcs. On the off chance orcs aren’t your jam, don’t buy this game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Alright, this game has a special place in my heart, it is probably the single most addicting and satisfying game i have ever played. cutting your way through Mordor 1 captain at a time has never felt better. i have come back to this game countless times for more, in fact, i'm re-installing it to do so as i write this. on sale or not, this game is worth every cent, no doubt. so i'll end this with a story i fondly remember that could only really be experienced in this game\\n\\nI had an orc named Gund Giggles, he wasn't the brightest, but he had a funny name, so i liked him regardless. after a long conquest of a fort with him helping me all the way, he was promoted to overlord of said fort after. Unfortunately, his position was short-lived and was killed in a defense not to long after by a Olog i don't remember the name of. losing him made me reasonably upset so i tried to track the bastard down and after 15 minutes i found him and engaged, but he was resistant to all my powerful tools, and killed me as well, but to add insult to injury, he BROKE MY GODDAMN SWORD. from this point i went from upset to pissed, he took my favorite orc, and now my best weapon too. i came back with a not as good, but still formidable sword to do it again, and keeping in mind his weaknesses, i took him down on my second try, recovering my sword, which was now reforged to the highest possible level, and avenging my best orc.\\n\\nExperiences like these are what make this game unique, and i HIGHLY suggest you play this game yourself.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Middle-Earth: Shadow of War is a sequel to 2014's Shadow of Mordor. Initially criticized by its heavy MTX format, Shadow of War developers have removed every form of microtransactions from the game (while still keeping loot boxes than can be acquired completing online, optional missions). Briefing finished, let's go to the review.\\n\\n[h1]Technical Aspects[/h1]\\n\\nMiddle-Earth: Shadow of War runs in 'Firebird', an expansion of the LithTech Jupiter EX from the previous game, and just like it, [b]it's a really scalable engine[/b]. Shadow of War runs very well and has a great number of graphical options, including a resolution scaler based on the desired FPS target (30 - 144). Overall, SoW doesn't look like a console port at all, and it does a great job as a benchmarking title for your new build. I ran it in 3 configurations: GTX 780Ti + i5 6600K, Ryzen 3 2200G (with its iGPU, OC'd to 1500MHz) and a Ryzen 1200 + RX460 4GB, [b]all of them were able to achieve a steady framerate with decent looking graphics, including the R2200G and its iGPU[/b]. I feel however that Shadow of War has issues with RAM management. Often, after long-playing times you could see some stutters and RAM numbers going wild, but given that it's an open-world game, with larger areas loading periodically, that's somewhat expected - I'd really recommend that players with 8GB or less to restart the game after 2 to 3 hours, it will make for a much more enjoyable experience.\\n\\nShadow of War is a beautiful game, especially in Núrnen, its second region. If you have some bandwidth to expend, you can also download HD texture pack and a 4K cutscenes packs to make your experience even better. If you don't, be ready to see some bad looking textures every here and there in minor locations, but overall, it still is a good looking game.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\n\\nShadow of War expands on the gameplay of its predecessor by allowing you to take control of orcs and building an army while invading and defending forts, offline and online. Of course, that's not the only change. \\n\\nIn the combat aspect, [b]SoW now encourage different character builds and play styles[/b]. Also expanding from SoM, close to its end, the game doesn't turn to be too easy as online challenges and the enemies generated by the Nemesis system [b]will level up along you[/b], so while most Orcs will be easier once you reach level 40, 45, you will still be challenged every now and then. Now, talking about the combat in itself - [b]its smooth and works, but it surely gets repetitive, especially when it comes to animations[/b]. There's about 5 animations for finishers, 5 for stealth attacks and 5 for brutalizing enemies; Monolith could've improved this by doubling this number because when you see all those five variations for the 100th time (and that will happen sooner than you'd expect) they won't be the same and the combat will stagnate. [b]Of course, SoW allows multiple approaches - instead of battling entire armies to reach a captain or a warchief, you can just bring him over to you with the right Archer upgrades[/b]. Or maybe if you prefer to use wild beasts to conquer the warzone, you can also focus in the Hunter skill-tree that allows you to summon beasts like Caragors and Graugs. \\n\\nAlso, [b]I can't go without mentioning the revamped domination system[/b]. Just like in Shadow of Mordor, you can take control of enemies in the middle of the combat and they will fight for you. This time however, you can also dominate captains, recruit them or shame them. Recruiting them will insert them in your army to fight for you and from there you can order them to kill other captains or upgrade them using coins that you get from killing enemies and completing missions.\\n\\nExploring the open-world is also pretty smooth but not without its flaws. Sometimes, especially when there's a large number of enemies in the screen all rounding you, the system to target enemies have a priority list that doesn't always work in the way that the player wish and sometimes, while jumping in a fight you can end doing the wrong thing as there's a wide-array of commands assigned to a limited number of keys.\\n\\nJust like its predecessor, SoW allows the player to travel through a Caragor (a lion-horse like creature), Graugs (giants) and a new addition to the roster are Drakes, flying creatures that can spit fire. For travelling using those, you will need to invest in the Hunter skill-tree so if you're like me, that is okay walking around on foot, it's completely skippable. I myself found mounting to be too messy to control and skipped it.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nShadow of War story continues from where SoM ended. [b]Celebrimbor forged a new ring and [b]he and Talion knows that it's time to fight Sauron[/b]. Sooner than later, it comes clear that they will need to build an army to fight Sauron's own army and your adventure starts from there. [b]The game has four subsets of main-quest missions - Bruz', Carnán's, Gondor's and the main ones)[/b][/b]. All of them rewards in exclusive skill unlocks for one of the skill-trees and I do recommend completing all of them before heading to the final missions, they provide a lot of XP and can make the online missions much more enjoyable.\\n\\nNow, for the story itself it is, well, mediocre, until the last mission. [b]Most characters are completely forgettable, Ratbag is back, sure, but you see him in two or three missions and he goes dark once again, and so does Gollum[/b]. Bruz is quite a funny guy and probably the best character after Talion and Celebrimbor and that's it. Idril's story is one of the worst I saw in recent times and Baranor is plain boring. [b]The way that the game works with them is not really ideal[/b]. \\n\\nAs stated above, Shadow of War, in my opinion had a good ending. I saw people calling it unfair and disappointing and that is understandable. The true ending is locked through a very hard and not that intuitive mini-game that takes hours to complete and before getting the ending you get might not be seen as I did by some players [b]that had a different vision on Talion and Celebrimbor tale[/b]. \\n\\n[h1]Nemesis System:[/h1]\\n[quote=IGN]In Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis System is the structure that Monolith has built that generates endless possibilities for the enemies you will face, the way they will act, and the stories that will grow as they face you again and again.[/quote]\\n\\n[b]The Nemesis system was impressive in Shadow of Mordor and it's even more impressive here[/b]. There's brothers who will avenge their siblings, orcs will have different classes and different backgrounds, and they will betray each other or fight between themselves in their lust for power. [b]Your followers will bring gifts to you in form of captured orcs that have information regarding enemies or they will get tired of you and will betray[/b]. \\n\\nAnd this is where the Nemesis missions enters. Now, captains will be doing duels between themselves, training gangs of orcs or hunting beasts in the wild. You can help them in their tasks so they can increase their levels or catch them when they have their hands full fighting against the world. \\n\\nWhile you may see orcs that look close to others between regions, they will have differences, even if really small ones. Maybe they're specialized in using venom instead of fire weapons, or maybe they will be invulnerable to stealth instead of invulnerable to arrows (or maybe both). It's interesting to see what the Nemesis system keep generating, especially in online where other people orcs can be transferred to your game by dominating them there and bringing them as captains to one of your fortresses. \\n\\n[b]SCORE:[/b] 9.0/10 - SoW is fun, big, and the Nemesis system along the online iterations makes up for a great game. It has its flaws, and the gameplay could've been expanded further. Nonetheless, Shadow of War is a must-play, I don't know nothing about LoTR, but I enjoyed to see Talion's tale coming to an end.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b]UPDATE:\\nWB and Monolith have removed pay to win elements from this game, including lootboxes. I shall keep this review negative however, as a lesson to Publishers and Devs alike that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated.[/b]\\n\\n\\n[h1]Tl\\'dr version: [/h1]\\n\\n[b]An amazing improvement upon the original, completely contaminated by some of the worst industry practices we have yet seen. Make no mistake, if the consumer base does not stop this now, we will be seeing not only microtransactions in $60 games but further degradation of the base game for them to wring every last ounce of money from us. DO NOT BUY THE LOOTBOXES.[/b]\\n\\nYou can follow me, and see the rest of my work here:\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\\n\\n[h1]Elaborated version:[/h1]\\n\\nMaybe from that you can already tell I will not just be talking about the base-game of Shadow of War for the whole review. Most reviewers policy is to separate industry practices from the game to judge the game \"on its own merits\". Well, here\\'s my issues with that. If you are compromising the product on purpose, in order to drag the game out, or purposely tear the game apart in order for you sell us content later down the line, that is most definitely an already compromised (ethically and mechanically) product. \\n\\nIf WB had kept their grubby mitts of this game, I would most definitely have given this a positive review. However, since that is not what they have done, this review will remain negative. \\n\\n[b]Microtransactions.[/b]\\n\\nSome in-depth analysis here. Firstly, the infamous loot box situation. You can buy orks from loots boxes, not just getting them out in the in-game world. This completely breaks in-game immersion and the economy of the game. You can either choose to ignore the loot boxes and go at it vanilla, where you\\'re missing out on possible high-level minions, as the game was obviously intended, as the level of orks you find are introduced on a gradient; the higher level you are, the better orks you will find. Additionally, what are essentially ads for the lootboxes keep popping up in game, where you are prompted to go and buy them. Also, if you want any hope of being \\'competitive\\' in the online game mode Shadow Wars, you\\'ll need some super powerful orks, something the lootboxes have the slight possibility to help with. \\n\\nConsequently, you will notice every dynamic in the game becomes centered around these things in some form of another:\\n\\nYou want an high level ork? Cough up! \\nYou want to upgrade your weapons and armor? You\\'ll need additional gems to do that, cough up!\\nYou want to play multiplayer? Better have some good orks, so cough up!!\\n\\nWhether the game would have been constructed like this without the cancer that is WarnerBrothers getting their claws into the mechanics of the game is completely moot. \\n\\nNow, with that out of the way, let\\'s talk about the game.\\n\\n[b]Story.[/b]\\n\\nYou a lord of the rings lore fan? This is going to be a rough ride. \\nThe game, for better or for worse, plays fast and lose with the canon to such an extent you wonder why not just set this in the time of the silmerilian and call it a day. However, if you can get past the desecration of established law (which I can), the story is actually quite compelling. \\n\\nFollowing on the last game, Ranger Talion and his ancient dead elf-friendo Calimbrimbor have made a new ring of power, just like Saurons. Great! What could go wrong. Turns out quite a lot actually. What follows is an epic, continent spanning war between the \\'Bright Lord\\' and Sauron. All sorts of shenanigans ensue! Just don\\'t get too disappointed if you were expecting high-brow Shakespeare. \\n\\n\\n[b]Movement and Combat.[/b]\\n\\nLike Shadows of Mordor but better. Everything is back from the last game, but with added upppf. Movement is buttery smooth, and really the game plays just like every other third-person openworld, Arkyum style game. Speaking of which, the combat system is straight outta Batman, which isn\\'t a bad thing. \\nCombat is fun and Talion\\'s wraith powers are suitably beefed up from the last game. \\n\\n[b]The Nemesis system.[/b]\\nI was going to add this to the last section however, it more or less is one of the most original ideas in the last decade in gaming. Essentially, the Nemesis system allows every individual ork to remember you, and everything you\\'ve done to them. Burn that ork captain in a fire, he might come for you later on. This is extended to the \\'meta game\\' aspect for creating armies. Your generals might betray you, or save your life. This creates some of the best dynamic stories in gaming really. However, sometimes the betrayals get a little too common, and you\\'ll find yourself trying to game the system in order to keep your orks on your side. \\nI won\\'t say anything more, it really is something better to experience for yourself. \\n\\n[b]Sound.[/b]\\nNot the best, not the worst. Voice acting is passable, with a few exceptions. Talion seems mostly asleep during his cutscenes, the voice actor is clearly phoning it in for his paycheck at this point. On the other hand, Calimbrimbor is the star of the show. His gravely tones are both charismatic and slightly scary, especially when he gets all shouty. \\nCombat noises are also quite good. Swords ring and the screams of orks will pervade your ears constantly. In this universe, all orks seem to have a slightly comical British cocny accent. You\\'ll either love it or hate it. \\n\\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\nNot concentrating on the poor industry behavior, this is a great game. However, I will not simply segregate them out of the review, because this stuff definitely effects the end product. Great game! But make a statement and wait for this to get to a low price. And DON\\'T, DON\\'T, DON\\'T buy those damn lootboxes!!',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have about 72hrs logged in SOM and I love that game. I have really been looking forward to SOW with many new features. I have to note that I have not completely finished the game because the ending cinematic is hidden behind a grind that is just not worth it for me. The last stage is fortress sieges over and over and over again... I would have understood defending each of your fortresses once, but the way it's designed is very grindy and boring. I quit after finishing stage 6 of the Shadow Wars. This just seems like a way to push you towards the micro-transactions, which I hate in a single player game. I have not accepted the EULA for the marketplace during my entire play-through and the game really tried to push me into it with many warnings and notifications.\\n\\nPROS\\n+ Better loot system\\n+ Armor customization and looks\\n+ Skill system\\n+ New enemy type (olog-hai)\\n+ New captain types and encounters (singers, ambushers, blood brothers...)\\n+ I have not experienced any crashes (opposed to what other players are experiencing)\\n\\nCONS\\n- Controls are sometimes inconsistent (especially the double jump distance seems to be very varied)\\n- The armor and weapons you wear does not appear in the cut scenes (it always reverts to the default armor)\\n- There are very little new animations and models (gets repetitive very soon)\\n- The micro-transactions / loot boxes\\n- The same dialogues from orcs (which can fortunately be disabled)\\n- The Shadow Wars stage grind for the ending cinematic is way too long and in my opinion not worth it\\n\\nIn conclusion SOW is not a bad game, it just doesn't bring enough new features like SOM did. I will not even be finishing the Shadow Wars stage and rather watch the ending cinematic on youtube. The Shadow Wars stage seems like a wall put in the game just to force you to use micros-transactions.\\n\\nI can not recommend it for the full price, just wait for some sale or until it gets to the price of SOM (GOTY edition can be had for ~5€).\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It's effectively more of the same. If you like SOM, you'll like SOW. The sequel has all you'd expect from a successor; better graphics, new abilities, improved gameplay etc. If you're a newcomer but familar with Assassin's Creed, then simply think of that but with a Lord Of The Rings reskin. If you're not familar with either the first game or the Assassin's Creed franchise, then for around £30 I recommend picking this game up. It's a little bit of an open world / sandbox.\\n\\nThose are it's good points. Time for the bad.\\n\\n- The story isn't exactly something that'll blow you away. Not terrible, but clearly there to weed you through learning different combat mechanics, learning new abilities etc.\\n\\n- It's very repetitive. Fortunately the combat is slick with enough variety to try out a few things or simply enjoy the spectacle, but it all boils down to run here...kill orcs...rinse, repeat.\\n\\n- The controls can be very sluggish. You stick like glue to practically everything, and sometimes you may want to jump one way but end up somewhere else or crawling a wall or GRRR. Also, using the mouse slider by default to allow you to sprint faster is a poor design decision because A) Not everyone has a (functioning) mouse slider, and B) Not everyone has one of the mouse sliders where you can just let it continue rolling after pressing down a button. It looks clunky repeatedly having to flick it up to move at a decent enough speed.\\n\\n- It's grindy. Not too bad in the early stages but you can see why they introduced...\\n\\n- Lootboxes. They have no place in a single-player only game. I'm not as up-in-arms as most peope are about microtransactions as they do have their place in the industry (IE. Free-To-Play games and / or cosmetics only), but for this game their implementation is wholly inappropriate.\\n\\nFor that point, and that last point ONLY, I'm rating the game a thumbs down. Not because it's bad (IT ISN'T), but simply because I can't condone a business practice that is hostile towards customers.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Middle Earth: Shadow of War is the sequel to Shadow of Mordor, my favourite game of 2014, which was set in the world of Lord of the Rings, and combined the Batman Arkham style third person combat with an innovative Nemesis system used to create interesting unique orcs to fight against. This sequel is pretty much the same game, but on a larger scale. The player once again controls Talion, the undead ranger of Gondor, who is being kept alive by the ghost of the Elf Celebrimbor, to continue fighting against the armies of Sauron and Mordor.\\n\\nTalion has a wide range of abilities available to use during combat. In addition to basic sword and bow attacks, and moves like dodge and counter, he has a rage meter which builds up by dealing damage. When full, you can either perform an execution, which will instantly kill a basic orc, or deal high damage to an orc captain, or you can use an energy blast which is an area of effect attack that can be upgraded to deal fire or poison damage. Shadow Strike allows you to aim your bow but instead of firing an arrow, you can teleport to that location and melee kill an orc – also useful for getting yourself out of danger when surrounded by enemies. You can shoot campfires to cause an explosion, and can shoot an enemy in the foot to pin them to the ground and prevent them moving for a short time. You can chain multiple stealth kills together. You can dominate orcs and force them to fight for you. And you can dominate wild animals – caragors, graugs and drakes, and ride them into battle.\\n\\nThere are two types of orc to fight against. Basic grunts can be equipped with a sword or club, bow, spear and shield, dual wield axes, and some ride their own caragor, but all are weak and die from a few hits. Captains level up over time, have much more health, and several strengths and weaknesses which you can identify by extracting intel from grunts. They could be immune from, scared of, enraged by, or killed instantly by any kind of attack, including stealth, headshots, fire or poison. They might wield their own fire or poison weapon, and could be protected by a gang of orc bodyguards. Figuring out how to take advantage of their weaknesses adds a tactical element to the combat.\\n\\nYou can collect loot from killed captains, in the form of better armour and weapons that have special properties which will influence your playing style. For example you could have a percentage chance to regain health or do fire/poison damage on critical hits, or you could regain bow ammo from stealth kills or headshots.\\n\\nWhen a captain is low on health, they can be mind controlled and forced to join your army. You can assign them as your bodyguard and summon them to fight alongside you. Or you could send them on missions to kill other enemy orcs. If you dominate a captain who is the bodyguard of a war chief, you can turn them into a spy, and then when you attack the war chief, the spy will betray their former master and help you kill them. However, dominated orcs can also betray the player, especially if you attack their blood brother.\\n\\nCaptains have alot of personality, and they’ll talk to you before a fight, threatening to kill you, or taunting you if they’ve already succeeded in a previous fight. I recruited one who was “mindless”, he only had a single line of dialogue, and everywhere he went he just kept saying “I don’t know. I don’t know”. I also fought against a couple of bards, who sang every line of dialogue like a song. However, over the course of the game you have to fight dozens, possibly hundreds of captains, so eventually I forgot which ones I had a personal history with.\\n\\nCombat quickly becomes chaotic in a good way. You’ll often enter a mission intending to kill a specific captain, only to notice there\\'s a second captain nearby, plus a few grunts. Partway through the fight, a third captain might join the fight. Eventually you’ll kill one, maybe dominate another and command him to stay and help you. By now you’re getting low on health. Suddenly a fourth captain appears with some caragors and a few more grunts, and this same fight that started about five minutes ago just keeps on going until you either retreat or get killed.\\n\\nTalion effectively has infinite lives, because Celebrimbor will keep resurrecting him, however dying does have negative consequences. Orc captains will level up and gain new abilities, which makes the next fight against them more difficult, and new captains will appear to replace the ones you\\'ve killed. When near death you can perform a last chance QTE to stay alive, unless the enemy orc has the \"no last chance\" ability. Sometimes your own orcs will appear at the last moment to save your life by killing your enemy just before they deliver your deathblow.\\n\\nThe story is pretty good, as you carry out missions to help the soldiers of Gondor, and an Elven assassin called Eltariel fight the Nazgul. Voice acting is mostly good, especially from Troy Baker as Talion and Laura Bailey as Eltariel.\\n\\nA large part of the game involves building your army of orcs to assault fortresses in five open world areas. The ultimate goal is to kill the orc overlord who commands the fortress, and take ownership of the fortress. Before that, its a good idea to kill or dominate the war chiefs who defend the fortress to make the final siege mission easier. And before that you’ll probably want to kill or dominate the war chiefs’ bodyguard captains. It took me 38 hours to complete the game, but during the last few hours the fortress capturing did start to feel repetitive. Especially in the final chapter when Sauron attempts to recapture your fortresses. If you lose the siege defence missions – which are really difficult because the game throws lots of really high level orcs at you – you’ll then have to spend another hour working through the whole captain/war chief/overlord hierarchy again to re-recapture the fortress.\\n\\nOther minor complaints include the fact that when you’ve captured a fortress, the surrounding area is still filled with enemy orcs. Although you’ll see a few friendly orcs too, I didn’t feel like I’d actually made the area safer. I quickly got bored of fighting grunts in the open world, so I just ran past them to the next quest location. Riding drakes sounds cool, but unfortunately the control scheme during flight is terrible, feels slow and unresponsive and this ruins what should have been an epic fight against a powerful enemy. And in another mission, I actually dismounted the drake because it was easier to kill orcs with my bow. \\n\\nWhile moving around the open world, the parkour controls can occasionally be a bit weird. I sometimes wanted to jump off a roof onto another ledge, but for some reason Talion would jump in a completely different direction to what I was pressing. This can be annoying when you’re trying to be stealthy but you unexpectedly land next to a bunch of orcs. I also noticed that Talion has a problem realising that you want to climb a thin pole and he’ll decide to jump past it, and he really struggles to climb through windows, instead choosing to climb up the wall around the window.\\n\\nWith the exception of these minor flaws, I didn’t suffer from any bugs or crashes, I was able to maintain a constant 60 FPS and I played with my xbox 360 controller which worked great during combat.\\n\\nShadow of War is a good game, and I recommend picking it up, especially if you’re a fan of Lord of the Rings. I waited almost a year to play it because of the controversy surrounding the inclusion of microtransactions at release. These have now been removed from the game, and the progression of levelling up Talion and his orc army felt fine to me.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I never really bothered to write a review for this game, mostly because everyone and their grandma has heard of it. But I do have a few things i want to say.\\n\\nFirst of all, I can\\'t really say anything about the game that nobody has said before, but go ahead and look at my playtime. I don\\'t think I would put this much time in a game I hated. I feel like that says a lot. If you want a long, detailed review, there are lots you can find. I personally liked Angry Joe Show\\'s review of the game.\\n\\nSecond, this game was released October 9th, 2017. Today, on July 17th, 2018, there was a free update released to the main game, which includes but is not limited to:\\n-The removal of it\\'s microtransactions, after public complaints and the stunt that EA pulled with Battlefront 2.\\n-Bug Fixes\\n-Balancing\\n-Makes the Last Act of the game far less tedious and repetitive\\n-And probably more that I can\\'t think of.\\nRegardless of their reasoning behind it, even if it\\'s just PR, the fact that there have people listening to the complaints and addressing them up until this point, and potentially more in the future? That\\'s really cool. So really, many of the problems that people have had with the game in the past are now fixed or lessened.\\n\\nThird, if you get the game, I highly recommend you get the \"Blade of Galadriel\" and \"Desolation of Mordor\" DLCs at some point. I personally did not get the Tribe dlcs and it seems to me like a waste of money, so I would recommend you stay away from that, but I can\\'t stop you if you want to.\\n\\nSo yeah. It\\'s a cool game. I felt like writing this. If you think \"Hey, this game looks pretty cool\", that\\'s because it is. It\\'s good.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I'm going to forgo the usual review structure and instead tell the story of a single Orc- Mozu.\\n\\nI first encountered him on a seige- my forces were swelled with two Ulugs, and we charged the gates with confidence. I myself bounded and slew among the orcs until one of my own- a titantic glutton by the name of Az-Teru- took a fatal blow. I rushed to revive him, but in the fevered pitch of battle I too was slain- my dying vision clouded by that singular orc, Mozu.\\n\\nMozu took a mount after the battle, and a new name- Mozu the Shadow. As he was a recent recruit to the captains, and he looked to lead mounts, I thought he might make a good recruit. I interrogated some of his own to learn that he was terrified of Morgai Flies. I infiltrated a feast of his, and managed to capture a rival of my own to fight on my side- another giant. After I ambushed Mozu, I dropped a nest of the flies on his head, causing him to quake with horror and flee. I tried to give chase, but neither luck nor haste was with me. Frustrated, I ordered the large orc I had convinced to defect, Ur-Lasu, on an assassination to finish Mozu off.\\n\\nI next met Mozu on that very assassination- I wanted to tip the scales. Mozu was different now, though- he still rode his carragor, but his flesh was riddled with boils, and his face was overtaken by a hideous hive. He was no longer Mozu the Shadow- he was now Mozu of the Flies. The flies I had dropped on him previously had infested him, and his fear of them was now absent. As well, his weapons dripped with poison from the flies- which I did not anticipate. His orcs overtook me, and with a well-placed throwing axe, He felled me.\\n\\nThis led to a promotion- he was now warchief. I noted, though, that he had a weakness- his blood-brother, Hork. Hork had also been there at the siege, and had clashed with me for some time- but I shamed him and let him go. Hork had his mind broken by me and his body abused, but I offered to make amends- the price of which was his blood-brother Mozu's skull.\\n\\nI then set out to cull Mozu's remaining allies, his two other bodyguards. I sent Ur-Lasu to kill his bodyguards, and with my help the deeds were done- two more captains came to the slaughter, and only joined the mincemeat. Enraged, Mozu showed himself- mounted on his Carragor, and speaking plain that the vendetta was no longer about power- it was something more personal. \\n\\nA thug that Mozu had brought with him murdered my bodyguard in the insuing melee- Mozu's poison had left me to retreat and leave him to the mercy of the thug. His life bought time- time enough for a swift revenge against the giant. His advantage lost, Mozu fled.\\n\\nMozu then set a trap for me- not knowing that he was the one in danger. When I came to the trap, I remembered something- how Mozu had changed over the long campaign of assassinations I had waged against him. So, I used one of his own tactics against him. When he and his men charged me, I fled. From the rafters, baileys and merlons, I lept again and again into him, peppering him with stealth attacks- before finally hitting him with a fatal execution.\\n\\nIn his dying moments, he turned to me and swore that his death meant little- for his blood brother would avenge him. Moments later, he was cut to ribbons- never knowing that his blood brother Hork not only would not avenge him- but had led to his demise.\\n\\nHis brother did end up rebelling- but his death was swift.\\n\\nAnd this was the end of his story. Had he not cheated death.\\n\\nMozu, cheating death, jumped me after I assassinated a Ulug- in my weakened state, he finished me off, and taunted me in his moment of vengeance for slaying Hork.\\n\\nI wasn't pleased to learn of Mozu's return, so I sent an Ulug to kill him, and joined in on the ambush. When I came to it- it was he that ambushed me. However- I was not the same ranger he had terrorized before, and he was less of the orc that had done such terror. The battle was quick and painful- and he fell quickly. When I finally finished him off, I felt- sad. But hoped that Mozu's legacy would finally rest- a lowly orc that had achieved so much so fast, fueled only by our mutual spite.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Remark prior to reading:\\n- I do not care for the hype- nor the hate-train. I judge as I usually judge: based on nothing but my own opinion.\\n\\nI didn\\'t pre-order and kept my distance from this one until my favourite Reviewer (Gamestar) finally convinced me, and I\\'m with them 100%.\\n\\nI really liked \"Shadows of Mordor\" except his many shortcomings. And I\\'m not even a big Tolkien or Lord of the Rings-Fan. So I\\'m speaking purely gameplay-wise.\\nBut Mordor left me \"meh!\" after like 10 hours. Those 10 hours were great, but after that it just went boring and repetitive. \\nThe usual problem of the usual Ubisoft-\"Formula\" of totally uninspired \"map-clearing\".\\n\\nBut with \"Shadows of War\" they really removed those shortcomings. Mostly. I would have bet they relied on former success and just go for a quick cash-grab.\\nEvery Meter (or foot) you\\'d take, there\\'s something to do. And most often not just for the sake of having something to do, but for skill-points, \\nspecial skills or story or just moneyyyzzz.\\nAnd \"recruiting\" Captains to join your army, assigning them jobs, helping them complete missions, slowly raising your force to wage war in a region and all that is really motivating. And overall a damn fun to do!\\n\\nBut beside all the shining glory there\\'s an UGH! behind it:\\nLoot-Boxes. Yes. Sucks. They should be quartered, hanged and burned for that. But who can blame them. I guess those boxes alone are flushing\\nat least a Million bucks into their cash-registers. So who wouldn\\'t tread that path? (Except CD Project Red who simply did it with pure excellence)\\n*BUT* they are really not needed if you enjoy the game for the gameplay and not just for rushing through the story. The \"Endgame\" will be\\nhidden behind a \"grind\" (which is good if you actually enjoy the game, or else...why play it?) or a paywall. Legendary Orks will help, yes.\\nBut finding them is the thrill. Just buying them. Meh. Probably gets boring very fast.\\nNormal loot-boxes with items or Orks up to Epic (one level below Legendary) are buyable with ingame-currency which is not hard to come by.\\nAnd if you\\'re OK with that, you can even cheat your money and edit your Orks. IF you are ok with that and are in a rush.\\n\\n\\n(I only fear that these not-really-super-needed-loot-boxes are just slowly a test for our stupidity and will increase in necessity with every game. Let\\'s hope not)\\n\\n\\n(!) SIDE-NOTE: If you really don\\'t want loot-boxes or any online-content at all in your SINGLE-PLAYER-game, then simply decline\\nthe TOS the FIRST(!) time you start the game (it\\'s bound to your account and you cannot change it later!). You then have the total and complete\\nsingle-player-experience. No boxes, no revenges, no invasions.\\n\\n\\n[u]The good (what to love):[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*] Something to do whereever you go. And on top of it are weekly challenges and Vendettas (IF you accept the TOS)\\n[*] This game is flooded, literally, with Orks. Rarely you just see a handful. There are TONS OF THEM. \\n[*] Many skills with many modifiers to pick. Some hidden behind a level, some behind a quest, some behind collectibles.\\n[*] Collectibles are actually useful to collect and provide nice boni. Not just to stretch time.\\n[*] Much options in the menu. Tweak the game to your rig. Even got adaptive resolution scaling to provide constant FPS at the cost of resolution. GREAT!\\n[*] Well thought out keyboard-usage and fitting on-screen-helps/tips. With so many abilities it\\'s nice to be regularly reminded of them and HOW to use them with the few given keys.\\n[*] Dominating Orks? Creating your hidden army before raiding a camp and then with one button making them all your minions at once? Awesome!\\n[*] The new Nemesis-System and overall rework of the whole Army-system is great. Really well done.\\n[*] Graphically more than adequate and nice-looking if you care for that. Every region has its own unique look.\\n[*] In addition to the wolf-thingies and the troll-thingies you can now ride dragon-thingies. And they even have some special attacks and skills. Yay!\\n[*] Loading-times are acceptable. Once you\\'re in a region there\\'s barely any loading-times except for some quests. \\n[*] Loot! In Mordor it was boring. Here it\\'s a LITTLE bit like Diablo. You constantly find yourself comparing stats and upgrading your stuff. There are even the usual sockets to put crystals in. And the usual 3 x low = 1 time higher, and 3 x higher = etc. Keeps you going!\\n[*] Not enough to do already? Avenge your friends (and strangers) who have been killed by some Ork. Kill those Orks for a Chest to open (with some items in it).\\n[*] The new army-system is really impressive. So goddamn many Orks. And everyone\\'s kinda unique although randomly generated.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[u]The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*] The characters are so bland, stereotype and boring. Except the Spider-Lady, and the Ringsmith maybe. That may be totally just me not being a LOTR-Fan anyway. So probably you\\'d see that differently.\\n[*] May be just me, but once you get your hand on some Legendary items you just sell everything below. As you can upgrade the legendarys every 10 Levels AND they give set-Boni as well.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[u]The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*] Loot-boxes. Please. Stop. Noone cares for my opinion, especially not those you decide, but....please. STOP.\\n[*] No targeting. While being nice to have a few keys less it sometimes really pisses you off. Trying to induce one specific treatment to one specific Ork can be a chore. You have no real influence who you\\'d target/attack.\\nCan sometimes be really frustrating when you\\'ve seem to have won the battle but then fail to finish the right target off twice in a row and you get hit from wherever and die. \\n[*] Those \"speeches\" when you face a new Captain+ or when he\\'s retreating: Cool for the first five times. And then...you can\\'t skip it. It can really grow ANNOYING to wait for their random insults to end. \\n[*] I know nowadays everything is console-dumbed-down and then just adapted for PC. But, no direct access to inventory nor quests with a key-press. Nope. Go to the main-menu and select it there. WTF?\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n\\n[b]Recommended?[/b]\\n\\nIf you liked Mordor, YES!\\nIf you liked Mordor but don\\'t want to invest time to see the end AND don\\'t want to spend money? Nah.\\nIF you liked Mordor and don\\'t care to see the end as long as you\\'re having fun for 10, 20, 30 or more hours? Sure!\\nIf you haven\\'t played Mordor but like Action-RPGs with Stealth-mechanics (which you don\\'t HAVE to use) like Dishonored? See above.\\nIf you don\\'t like the usual Ubisoft-\"Formula\" of clearing maps: Nah, maybe not.\\n\\nJust be \"warned\": If you don\\'t LIKE to spend many many hours in a game you enjoy, you will be forced to pay money to see the end, or you just don\\'t.\\nThen again, who cares. The Story isn\\'t THAT interesting anyway.',\n",

       "  'review': '87 hours, and wow am I aware of every single minute of it.\\n\\nSome games are games you can lose yourself in.  I still genuinely can\\'t believe that I\\'ve got almost 800 hours in Fallout: New Vegas.  Did I play it a lot?  Sure!  Does it really seem like I\\'ve played it the equivalent of 50 days straight with no breaks (other than 8 hours sleep a day)?  No, it really doesn\\'t feel like that.  This game, good as it is, doesn\\'t have that.  When I\\'m not in the midst of a battle - which to be fair, I usually am - I\\'m excruciatingly aware of the passage of real world time I\\'m putting into this game.  Primarily because there\\'s very little sense of progress.\\n\\nJust to state it up front, I enjoyed this game, but it\\'s a slog.  The act of making your progress and retention of said progress contingent on randomness is a novel idea, and I don\\'t hate it, but . . .\\n\\nThe thing is that the lion\\'s share of this game is one singular goal.  Take over areas to secure regions and build and army to fight Sauron\\'s.  That\\'s it.  That\\'s the goal.  And having a clear goal is fine.  And there are sidequests outside of this, but I\\'m not motivated by caring how they pan out, because you already know that they\\'re not going to affect your main quest.  You just want those extra perks.  I love story, but I was searching for a way to skip the cutscenes because I just.  Did.  Not.  Care.\\n\\nThe passage of time made cutscenes obtrusive and painful.  Literally painful.  I was pained to watch these unfold because there were no surprises.  Nazgul will sneeringly threaten and you\\'ll resist, people will offer vaguely worded prophecies or warnings with zero context, making the information definitely useless to me, and if Talion isn\\'t getting the point he makes literally no attempt to request clarification because that\\'s not how Middle-Earth characters work - at no point in the books, movies, or either of the \"Shadow\" games does anyone ever stop to say, \"OK, back up.  Look, I think there\\'s some crucial context missing here, and I\\'m gonna need you to elaborate, let\\'s put this in layman\\'s terms, OK?\"\\n\\nYou\\'re battling through hordes of orcs and oh my god, [spoiler]do NOT go back to the city area after it\\'s been lost[/spoiler] because the supposedly-random \"Death Defying\" and \"Iron Will\" traits will be absolutely common.  Just about every orc you fight will go back to full health once you beat them once, resist joining your team, die, and then come back to kill you again.  It\\'s highly irritating.\\n\\nI wanna be clear, when you\\'re not going from place to place (which with fast travel and how fast you run on foot, is minimal) the game is fun.  Fighting is fun.  And I actually like the orcs!  There are a ton of them I was like, \"You know, I really hope I can get you in my army because you seem great.\"  The attributes are a little weird, though.  I got killed by an archer who was pretty verbose about how glad he was to kill me, and then he became \"the Screamer\" and just shrieked as a means of communication.  \\'Twas odd.\\n\\nAnyway, the game looks great, it sounds great, the mechanics themselves are fun.  The skills are a treat, the side quests offer some nice variety.  The gems you can use for upgrades are interesting and can definitely be a help depending on your playstyle.  It\\'s just a slog.\\n\\nIf you want a game where you\\'re really motivated to get into the game world and change things one way or the other, or to really feel like a part of the story yourself, like you\\'re having an impact personally (rather than just by default checking off bits of what the story requires to progress and having the same experience as literally everyone else) then this game will likely feel like a slog to you, too.  If, however, you enjoy the repetition and the fighting and running into orcs in the wild and trying to get 100%, this is probably right up your alley.  For the completionist mindset, this game\\'s almost certainly a treasure.  There\\'s a lot to complete with a lot of variation and none of it is impossible, but some of it is very challenging.\\n\\nFor me, these Warner games are great at giving me a game that I\\'m invested enough that I NEED to finish, but have 0 interest in ever playing again.  Even the DLC I bought, it\\'s like, \"Additional stories?  Y\\'know what?  I\\'m good.  Let\\'s leave it where it is.\"\\n\\nStill, recommended for ONE playthrough.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is made in layers of gameplay and that\\'s what I like that much.\\n\\nFirst layer you play the story till you reach act 2 (it took my 8 hours to finish the tutorial) then you\\'re done with basic tutorial, where you play a story and you get introduced basic element of gameplay like your skills, the map, the collectibles (wich most of them are puzzles so they\\'re not just collectibles) and so on.\\n\\nThen you reach layer 2 where you can build your army of orcs, you can use them to perform various actions and even intervene in other orcs affairs, all with direct interaction and gameplay where you can take part directly (mostly by kicking asses)\\n\\nAfter that you play a siege against a fort (all this during other story missions completely separated from other layers of gameplay at least till the end of the tutorial).\\n\\nThe siege imagine like a Total war Huge scale siege in real time where you play the part of the champion commander and you help your army to conquer various victory points around the fort. During this siege nothing is just there for the fuck of it, you can go anywhere attack from anywhere and fight anything that moves in this huge map with tons of units around, nothing is for show, everything is part of gameplay, at first you think it\\'s a cinematic bceause cmon it\\'s just too much, but then you transition in control and you undertand it\\'s freacking for real. (example of subtetly during a siege, u can assign prior to the event an orc to spy and backstab an enemy leader controlling a victory point upon your arrival at said point, if he succedes or not is another story, so chose well, OR you can just take them all in your army and bash the fort, for every enemy you kill prior the siege or assimilate in your army that are actually in charge of something for the enemy, the fort loses logistics and siege engines or traps and you gain them (if you didn\\'t kill it) based on that particular foe and what he was assigned to,!!AWESOME!!)\\n\\nWhen you are done with that you get to the last boss (the warlord) and you get to fight it, kill him...or...get in control of the fort, assign your hierarchy and the new warlord if needed with relative bodyguards to him , you captains etc etc etc because you know...you might get attacked one day.\\n\\nBefore the siege you can assign upgrades to your orcs of choice (that you bent to your will waaay before this) and give them unique upgrades like assign them to command a company of a specific kind of intantry or siege beasts or whatever you like (based on that captain traits and class)\\n\\nWhen you are done with this you notice the map like a total war game where you unlock adiacent zones (that you must explore and play in them) where the story progresses and you can build further your army to conquer those zones too one by one by forging your army and bending more captains to your will (all with your freedom of upgrades choices) and doing more sieges and more difficult.\\n\\nYou get to train your orcs and equip them with kinds of weapons or traits or mounts. (There\\'s Haredrim too). your troops are active and present and visible in the map and your named warriors are doing activities in which you can help them if you wish to guarantee a reward for you and them (and maybe avoid death if you really care about a particular warrior)\\n\\nEvery orc has its own strenghts and weaknesses and you must consider them before assigning them missions (in which you\\'ll obviously take part if you wish or just watch from a distance how they play out and maybe let the enemy kill your orc because maybe you don\\'t like him and then bend to your will that enemy orc weakened by your allies). They also have beautyful characterized randomized cosmetics and personalities with awesome procedural dialogues that actually talk about what you are doing using all the names of the characters you bring with you for insults considerations and so on, in other words they are alive, seriously (and btw they remember things, what you did...even bad things) also they bring with them the marks of combat and injuries..crazy. You can make an orc Deranged by repeatetly shaming it, basically you create a monster that\\'s totally out of his mind, or acts like a baby and beats like a train. The orcs talk in the open world about stuff that really happened concerning your actions and your interactions with you, you can notice that using stealth and spying on them.\\n\\nThe Orcs learn your combat moves and they get better at countering your moves if you spam them continuosly, and even make fun of you.\\n\\nIf you get killed by a trash orc in the map it gets the first lowest position in the hierarchy of the enemy and becomes named usually underlining his achievement in killing you and how he did it, if no slots are free he\\'s gonna fight a duel and if he wins he\\'s gonna get it, retaining his appearance (with armor maybe) and class and traits he most likely had when he killed you.\\n\\nYou level up choosing your traits and your abilities that best suit your playstile or situation.\\n\\nYou drop loot which then you can level up by completing challenges. There\\'s Sets, rares, legendaries and so on.\\n\\nYou get to socket your equipment with gems that you can upgrade with various effects (diablo 3 style seprated by armor , rune, weapon effects) .\\n\\nYou can order your Orcs to train in the Fight pit against other orcs to improve their skill, get rewards for you or money (and actually watch the match like a mortal kombat round), or make them your personal bodyguard if you wish. (I\\'m going around with a huge ass troll clad in heavy armor with a gang of berserkers that I .... IIIIIIIIIIIII choosed for him as mob).\\n\\nYou can order your orc or orcs to ambush another enemy orc activity changing EVERYTHING, from dialogues to outcomes. And you get actually to play that, so \"what ifs\" are a reality.\\n\\nYou can go online and test assault other players fort to boost your army (the target player won\\'t lose progress to my undertanding but I\\'m not 100% sure, get informed if it may bug you, but I know you can disable online features just in case).\\n\\nYou can get your orcs to fight other players\\' heroes in the Fight Pit.\\n\\nAnd much more.\\n\\nThe story is great, The characters very well designed (Shelob is awesome), the combat is extremely fun as well as the exploration and the animations are so beautyfull you\\'ll forget you\\'re playing a game.\\n\\nIt runs great on a gtx980 in 2k everything on ultra with the HD texture pack.\\n\\nYou have millions of hours of FUN.\\n\\nYou can customize every detail of your UI and gameplay experience.\\n\\nThere\\'s 3 expansions (Yes I used the word EXPANSION not DLC for a reason).\\n\\nThe game is freacking LONG.\\n\\nI another player gets killed by an orc you get to fight him and have access to his procedural created orc which are unique to each player)\\n\\nMicrotransactions are gone.\\n\\nThere\\'s Nazghuls, drakes, all sort of monsters and shits.\\n\\nNow this game does alot of things in a fun genuine way and I\\'m astonished how well they play out. It\\'s freacking awesome. \\n\\nI never expected this game to be at this level, I can only imagine what this studio could make if they were to make a Warhammer fantasy game.\\n\\nMy advice? Just buy it, it\\'s worth every penny.\\n\\nBear in mind in my review I talked about 50% of the game, I didn\\'t mention the story and other stuff.\\n\\nCons: The game is around 130gb, of CONTENT. So yeah, it\\'s not even a con.\\n\\n           The targeting system takes time to get used to, there\\'s no target lock so you need too aim at specific characters when fighting or ambushing, but nothing game breaking, you\\'ll get used to it. If it bugs you you don\\'t deserve this game and move along.\\n\\nThis game might look boring to someone or repetitive, that\\'s because they don\\'t know or played the game enough to understand what you can actually do. Gamers are used to have the Devs hold your hand and lead you to the end of the story with nothing else, this game is different, it needs to be played with a less casual mindset.\\nIt has nothing to do with AC.',\n",

Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor took me by surprise. The game was really enjoyable. Enjoyed every bit of it. Middle-Earth Shadow of War takes everything done right from shadow of Mordor and improves it by an unexplainable margin.\\n\\nThe story starts right after the ending of Shadow of Mordor. The ring maker and Talion (The main character) have forged a new ring, which attracted some new foes and friends. The story was rich and was enjoyable. They have improved the story. Completely different direction.\\n\\nMost of the gameplay aspects stayed the same, but some new ones were added which enriched the gameplay even more. The animation and gameplay felt more fluent and cleaner than Shadow of Mordor. Surprisingly,  The famous nemesis system got a HUGE BUFF. It was a really interesting and fascinating invention/system in the shadow of Mordor, But it truly shines in Shadows of War. No wonder why did, Wb patented it. It's MAGNIFICENT. Truly and worthy selling point.\\n\\nThe combat of this series is a mixture of the Batman Arkham series with the assassin creed. Surprisingly It's stealth mechanism and gameplay is way way better than the whole assassin's creed franchise. XD\\n\\nNemesis system spices things up since every orc you encounter has a different personality, different weaknesses different strengths which makes every encounter memorable, challenging and new. It's not just beat them up, it's thinking and dominate. You could spend hours playing the game without getting tired. Sometimes you will make your foes run away and sometimes your foes will make you run away. Sometimes it feels like you're playing as DARTH VADER in the lord of the ring universe (literally).\\n\\nThe visuals were superb. The whole world-building was extraordinary. The game has 5 regions where the shadow of Mordor only had 2. All of the 5 regions are different from one another. All of them are filled with non-repetitive activities. (depends on perspective) One is a forest base where another one is located near a volcano. Swapping out one region to another is a refreshment. New visuals new challenges in each region.\\n\\nAs I said the game is full of activities. It will take a pretty decent amount of time to finish. If you just want the story then it will take around 30 to 40 hours. But if you want full completion then it's more than 80 hours of gameplay. Cherry top on all of these is that this game has online PvE. Meaning it's endless. I aimed for completionist and it took 100hours! And I didn't even realize 100 hours have passed, it's that good. The value for money is unimaginable, even 60/70$ games don't have this much content nowadays.\\n\\nThe end game meaning the shadow wars might get a bit grindy. But it is necessary to get the true ending. One which connects with Lord of the ring directly.\\n\\nDid face some bugs but they were one time only, so nothing to worry about.\\n\\nSo if you couldn't tell already I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Manswine!\\n\\n  Oooh, lookee what we got ’ere. A filthy, softskinned maggot squirmin’ about on the ground, tryin’ to dig up information for this lit’l ole’ gob ’o software ‘Shadow of War’. Well, if it’s dirt you want, Gamewalker, you came to the right orc. I’ll be more than happy to slice your head open with this sharp axe ’ere and fill it with all kinds of useful tidbits about this game. Yeah, I’ll pluck out those juicy lit’l eyeballs of yours and bob them into a vat of boiling facts and features, then squish the remains into your ears so you can hear how entertaining this game is and… and… then I’ll tear off your boots and make you eat your own feet while cracking your buttcheeks open to bite out your… your… rect… umm… uhh… Ohhh, just read it and bugger off, already! Geeeaaaaaah!\\n\\n  The first thing you’ll encounter when you start up SOW is the intro theme song. It’s a short piece, but a thoughtful, moody composition and gives reassurance you’re about to embark on a deep gaming experience. In addition to the music, sound effects and excellent voice acting, there are other aspects to admire, some of which were improved upon from it’s predecessor SOM, most notably the size of the download file. 107Gb. Stop rubbing your eyes, it won’t change what you just read. 107Gb. Save them for all the crying you’ll do as you wait for it to ever finish. If you have a crappy connection like me, you must resolve to the fact you can’t do sh!t on the internet for the next 30 hours. It is, however, remarkably stable for a game of this size, only crashing once 62 hours in because I didn’t run the file integrity checker. Sadly, the save file did not survive.\\n  \\n  Once in, you’ll find yourself playing a grieving, recently deceased ranger of Gondor, Talion (or, as they called him at the tavern Hard ’n Stiff, ‘Talion the Stallion’). On top of this, he’s also possessed by the wraith of Celebrimbor, an elf with a grudge against the main antagonist, Sauron. Think of him as a strong-willed, yet naggy wife no exorcism can remove. Still, he offers useful information to keep Talion advancing along with the main plotline.\\n\\n  The gear he gets to wield and wear reside under an interface of mediocre design. After you pick them up—and you’ll pick up plenty—they each go into long, long scrolling lists with no end in sight.  If you want to remove them, you must pay for this service. What?!? Instead of forcing us to deplete our hard-earned game funds for their disposal, why not just let us sell them?\\n  Like many RPGs, the gear can be improved, although in this game it took a rather bland design approach. Collecting augment gems is good in theory, but when there are five tiers, 2-5 requiring 3 gems from the previous tier, you’ll need to collect 81 t1 gems to acquire one t5. Despite this daunting task, however, there are quest rewards giving higher tier gems as a shortcut, making it somewhat less painful. It’s not until you can mount a graug will you reduce this from a slow, repetitious nightmare to a hilarious stomp and smush farming fest as you clear out entire Uruk encampments with your three-toed 7k horsepowered rototiller. I had all of the top gems by level 30. (Shhh! Don’t tell them I did this.)\\n\\n  Character progression is borderline cliché, but it gets the job done. Most of the skills are useful and provide new and entertaining feats to perform in the game. Skill point allocation isn’t balanced, however. By level 38, I had—what I believed to be—all the useful ones. By 50, I had 20 extra. Hey! Can I sell these too? [i]Sigh.[/i]\\n\\n  Controlling Talion is one of the best features of the game. The player motion is smooth, especially in combat, and you’ll want to explore every buttcrack and crevice to be found in all the beautifully crafted maps spread throughout this seemingly seamless game. However, before you can even begin to immerse yourself in this amazing kinematic experience, you must first pass… The Keyboard Remapping Test. At first, it seems like any other game: click on the ‘W’, then click on ‘NUM 8’ and ‘Woohoo!’ you can now move Talion forward with your shiny new movement key. But—for some neuron-disconnected reason—it doesn’t quite work this way. Take this disturbing example: If you remap the key to enter stealth mode, sixteen other keys will also be idiotically remapped to enter stealth mode and—for whatever reason—flush your neighbor’s apartment toilet. “Ha ha! Flooded your bathroom!”\\n \\n   There are numerous feats your hero can acquire to battle his foes, and it’s a simple task of paying attention to the visual clues—both deliberate and as a consequence of the rendered scene—in order to triumph amid a swarm of thirty, angry orcs. I couldn’t get enough of this to the point I was picking fights just to do combat, even if I got no advancement beyond a few augment gems. Screw the plot! Clang! Clunk! Smash! Smush! Stomp stomp stomp! Aaaaand… off I go to Combat Anonymous.\\n\\n  The foes you’ll encounter are just as interesting. As indicated by the intro, named orc banter—before they attempt to dispose of you—is hilarious. At first, I thought it would wear me down early in the game, but there are so many of them, it wasn’t until about level 40 I kinda wanted them to shut up and let me smash their heads in. One taunted me for so long, I expected to see an arm come up followed by the other tapping a finger on a wristwatch. He finally ended his babbling bitchboast by declaring he’d rip off all my skin and make me eat it. Kinda meaningless since, at that point, I’d already nibbled off a good portion of my right cheek in frustration. But, it did give me an opportunity to stretch out my neck and get the feeling back in my right shoulder… then eat a bag of popcorn… and half a jar of peanuts. Later, upon reflection, I realized this was by design, and they were shamelessly feeding on my frail and delicate addiction. You… sweet, beautiful bastard designers.\\n\\n  The final ‘boss’ battles—and some of the earlier ones—were tedious, rolling around on the floor like a circus chimp, desperately trying to interpret the clues to defeating the two remaining foes. “Ok, numpad+ numpad+ numpad+. Roll around roll around… squeal like I just got a banana up my butthole numpad+ WHACK! Witch king slap to my head! Owww! That hur… wait! Was that ‘NUM’ I saw? Should I drain… numpad+ numpad+ WHACK! Aww crap, I’m dead I… What? Hit the right mouse button to dodge the death blow? I did! Repeatedly! Nothing happened! Geeeaaaaaah!”\\n  Did you know a keyboard can sail quite far once it clears the window sill? That landscaping guy six blocks down the street? BAM! Beaned right off the deck mower and into a Morgai nest.\\n\\n  As you may have guessed—despite all the whining—this is a positive review. The game is entertaining early on, but then wears you out with what I felt was too long of a level grind as you built Talion up in preparation for the aforementioned cut-and-dry nature of the ending battles. But, I suppose they all come down to those final moments, don’t they. Admittedly, it’s way better than breaking down and deciding on a lame [i]deus ex machina[/i] conclusion where Sauron plummets to his death in a tragic outhouse accident because someone forgot to install the toilet seat. “Ha ha! Soiled your robe!”\\n\\n  This impressive production will entertain you for about a hundred hours and, if you have more talent than me to get through those tough final battles without dislocating a knuckle joint, you’ll appreciate how the ending climax ties into the original LOtR storyline.\\n\\n  I recommend this game to [i]all[/i] manfilth.\\n\\n  I can’t wait for the third installment of this franchise – Middle Earth: Shadow of Shelob’s Boobs',\n",

       "  'review': 'Shadow of War yielded plenty of hours of entertainment; however, it all blended into the same nebulous blur of indistinct violence and forgettable story. The moment-to-moment action was enjoyable enough, but after it was all said and done, I left the game with a sense of disappointment at the squandered potential. Of all the games in my library, this is one of the more deserving ones of a \"Neutral\" rating, rather than the restrictive \"Yes\"/\"No\" currently available on Steam reviews.\\n\\nI\\'m not a big fan of the Tolkienverse. Its aesthetics and thematic trappings are appealing, but otherwise not hugely my thing - so my interest in the game hinges almost exclusively on its own merits. This is where, unfortunately, it falls somewhat flat. The narrative is dull, and has you essentially completing favours for a rotating cast of unlikable and unwilling allies, with few redeeming qualities besides their usefulness to your warlord efforts, playing once again as the equally unlikable and unwilling Talion in his quest to defeat the boring and predictable order of whoever to protect the land of whatever - none of it is made to matter, with what little narrative progression there is occuring mostly in rigidly segmented cutscenes. At no point do you make choices that are woven in with the game\\'s events, thus isolating you from the rich moral quandaries explored by the greater LotR fiction. Your primary mechanical engagement is therefore violence, be it through direct combat, stealth, or subjugation of orcs for your own side, gathering them like Pokémon to bolster your own forces to defeat Generic Evil Lord.\\n\\nHow does the combat fare? Overwhelmingly AAA-game-design-by-committee, it provides fantastic spectacle and feature breadth, but lacks the depth to keep things interesting past the first five hours. Indeed, other than minor variations on existing attacks, those first few hours will show you everything there is to see. It\\'s impressive to behold - explosions, fire, ice, swarms of spiders and drakes, endless orcs charging at you, dismembered limbs and heads flying everywhere - and the sense of chaos is palpable. This is a game in which the butterfly effect can send minor events spiralling out of control, and it\\'s genuinely fun to see a small fire attack snowball into an entire camp igniting in a rampaging blaze, as the flurry of flames and destruction cause bedlam like few other games can... and yet, it\\'s surprisingly dull to actually play.\\n\\nThere\\'s unfortunately not much more to the game beyond its superficial dazzlement. The combat itself is rather shallow and sloppily implemented. Some examples of basic design rules that are needlessly broken: Player animations are random, rather than predictable, preventing the development of timing mastery; enemies can attack you from off-screen; damage triggers don\\'t match with certain animations or sounds, causing frustration and weakening the sense of importance of each hit; many of the multiple-choice upgrades have objectively best options; some weapon types are objectively better than others of the same rarity; Talion will often target completely different enemies to what you had in view or to which you pointed the thumbsticks. There are more, but the greatest offender to me is the poor combat feedback: Weapons sound weak and generally indistinguishable. Much like the combat, strikes come across as mushy and unremarkable, and the weight and satisfaction of impacts is so diminished that, despite it being a mere auditory illusion, you feel weaker and combat feels less engaging. Sadly, animations don\\'t line up greatly either, neither for Talion nor enemies. Compared to games with similar combat like Arkham Knight, it\\'s a significant step backwards. It sounds like a minor complaint, but when stretched over 40+ hours, I cannot overstate the importance of good feedback during combat, and sadly, Shadow of War misses the mark. Coupled with repetitive encounters filled with generally samey enemies employing repetitive strategies, it soon all becomes sadly forgettable, failing to provide opportunities to use tactical approaches during its endless fights, which eventually start to all play out the same.\\n\\nThe Nemesis system returns with some upgrades to enemy variety and use, but it\\'s ultimately the same as Shadow of Mordor: An interesting idea that barely ends up mattering because of how simple it is to switch between different playstyles without any long-term investment. Freedom of choice to this extent theoretically expands player agency, but does so at the cost of strategic depth by allowing you to switch between powers and equipment at any time, thus negating the need to actually prepare for the fights against special orcs with unique traits, and consequently robbing them of their significance or long-term impact. It\\'s really cool seeing orcs with unique traits, especially if they return bearing the marks of your previous fight, but like the combat, the spectacle is forced to make up for tedium.\\n\\nThe fortress system is promising - and it actually succeeds quite well. Despite being a bit too grindy, you can capture and defend fortresses by progressing through multiple layers of defenses, using specialised equipment and units to gain an edge. Among others, you\\'ll deal with traps, ogre-mounted cannons, beast charges, drake fireball bombing runs, wall destruction, and more. You can weaken defenses by assassinating commanding orcs in advance, but I found that doing so made the sieges less interesting and challenging. Though not the deepest system around (and certainly nowhere near as strategically interesting as it should be), fortresses provide literal and metaphorical structural constraints to combat, which emphasise unique mechanics and player dynamics and create memorable moments. It turns out that chaos is as its most enjoyable when guided by the rules of siege engagement.\\n\\nNot much space left, so a quick overview of the rest of the game: Graphics are decent for the time and hold up, though I recommend using a sharpening filter as the TAA implementation is quite rudimentary. Sound is okay, though you will hear the same barks repeatedly. The open world is much more varied and topographically exploitable than Shadow of War, though the game never does anything interesting with it. Quests are absurdly repetitive and unfortunately grindy. Stealth is close to pointless due to the minute proximity at which enemies spawn, undoing your efforts. Loading times and performance are good, provided you have enough VRAM to meet the rather inflated requirements.\\n\\nAll in all, Shadow of War is [i]fine[/i]. It\\'ll never be anyone\\'s GOTY, but I get the distinct feeling that its developers don\\'t expect it to. It casts a wide net, throwing mechanics and systems at you without much consideration for their true purpose beyond growing the bullet point list of features on the back of the box. It won\\'t leave a lasting impact, and in my 43 hours I didn\\'t encounter a single moment where it tried to examine a meaningful theme or concept - but that\\'s okay. It\\'s a big, dumb, AAA slash-em-up with towers, collectables, skill trees and meaningless quests. If you\\'re after McDonald\\'s rather than a dinner at the Ritz, this is the game for you: Turn off your brain, put on a podcast and enjoy the flashing lights, and you\\'ll have a perfectly serviceable time. It\\'s just a shame that such a strong license and collection of grand ideas adapted from other franchises ended up producing such a remarkably unremarkable game.\\n\\n[h1]★★★☆☆[/h1]',\n",

       "  'review': \"Alright so I have not done a review for a game before however I will try to be fair in my review of this game.\\nI will try to keep a specific format and there will be a tldr at the bottom.\\n\\nMiddle Earth Shadow of War has been one of my favorite releases of this year. Being a fan of mature and realistic fantasy, especially Lord of the Rings, this game holds a lot of both fun and appreciation for the effort that went into it. I will seperate this review into six categories, in chronological order; Game design/gameplay, world design/exploration/progression, story(spoiler free), art, music/vibe, and economy. For each of these I will list off the pros and cons that go with them;\\n\\nOkay so Game Design. There is a lot to talk about in the games design, from combat with both the main controlled character and that of the orcs on the sides of the player character and the enemy, as well as the games most marketed feature, the nemesis system.\\nCombat in this game can be fun, however it is not without flaws:\\n\\n-Pros: As Talion combat can feel very unique. You have several different ways to fight and you really rely on the enviroment. The learning curve is not too heavy, and at most difficulties you will be scanning the environment around you to combat different orcs. This awareness of your surroundings and your ability to adapt and capitalize on a variety of different mechanics and tools at your disposal makes combat feel a lot more interactive and appealing to continues with. For orcs vs orcs combat may vary based on the intelligence of the ai for that orc and their own skills, and finding orcs who excel at either form of combat or even both definitely blends well with other parts of the game. Combat never overly bores me, but it still has its flaws;\\n\\n-Cons: The main issue of having fun with combat as talion vs orcs is that after a good while of gameplay, most orcs are all the same. There are six different archetypes of orcs, and it does get rather repetitive. It is better that it should be simplistic in this case, and for certain there should not just be 10s of types of orcs you all have to be aware of how to fight, but after a while all you have to understand is what that orcs specific strengths/weaknesses are and how to generally fight them. This isn't too great of a detriment to the fun of it, but combat with orcs will certainly just end up repetitive over time and you won't be really playing the game for a unique plethora of enemies to fight, you'll likely be playing it for the nemesis system. Orc versus orc is not really an exception either, in fact in orc vs orc I would argue is even less varied. Combat varience is not the games strongsuit and as I said not what most people will play and stay for, instead it will be for the most marketed attraction of the game, the nemesis system;\\n\\n-The nemesis system, if you've not heard, can be generally explained as 'your enemies and allies will remember what you do and react accordingly'. Among the things this game accomplishes well, the nemesis system is certainly one of them. Using a complex series of ai this system allows a sense of realism and immersion with the orcs in the game, having their reactions to the things you do give a sense of personality. For the pros of the system;\\n\\n-Pros: The nemesis system in game allows you to find orcs you really like and forge a bond with them. Not many games can boast of a relation between you and the npcs in them at a level of depth such as this, and its a breath of fresh air for innovation of game immersion in the industry. Most people play with this system in order to try and get different orcs of different personalities whether by using the 'shame' mechanic or 'cheat death' mechanic. Definitely a system many would love other games to have, though the complexity of the ai required to create such a system does rather limit it to larger developers.\\n\\n-Cons: Repetition, that is that after a while, mostly concerning late game, you will find that there unique orcs, names, and personalities are far and few between as most spawning will probably be similar to others you have already found. Frustration can also be a very big thing since if you lose an orc you really liked, and they don't respawn, it is very annoying.\\n\\nWorld Design/Exploration/Progression: The game itself is very large, and the design of the world is of course based off of Tolkien's own, yet not every part of it holds up to such a standard. Exploration is not what you seek in this game and the progression system is, while not being too bad, is not the best either.\\n\\n-Pros: The broader world of the game definitely looks and feels nice, there are parts where it looks good and finding your way around the five different maps can be cool. The game does not have too high of a learning curve and the progression system is fine, certainly not terrible but nothing which feels too rewarding or fun TO progress through.\\n\\n-Cons: The maps, honestly, are not that varied. You will not be looking too intensely at every detail of them, care for exploring any hidden parts of it, or really spend time caring about the place you are in beyond another area to play with the nemesis system in. As for progression, after a certain point you are only getting skills you don't already want in your build and won't likely use often, meaning leveling up doesn't feel rewarding after the point you have all you want out of it, and progression can require a lot of grind and time.\\nStory: For those who care for the story of a game in Lord of the Rings, you may be disappointed in some ways. This game certainly holds true to the Lord of the Rings and respects the series, however the writing may fall flat in some areas.\\n\\n-Pros: It feels like LotR! This game, as I said, definitely respects the series and the writing, while not being done by Tolkien, is still decent enough that you can be engaged with the games story. You will likely enjoy several characters and how they act and the story is indeed appealing to follow.\\n\\n-Cons: Where the story falls flat, however, is in the predictability and development of some characters. I will not downright say that the story is bad, especially on the basis of it being a different righter, but there are for sure several stereotypes or predictable actions which some characters take. Character development mostly centralizes around Talion as well, so that other side characters really don't get used well, and I do understand that others do not like how some end up. Regardless the story is certainly fine and it holds its own as a good part of the game.\\n\\nArt: The game looks very nice and is not too bad looking at low settings, but machine requirements can take away from the experience for those with low end computers.\\n\\n-Pros: It can look very pretty and very realistic, especially with the 4k resolution pack(free) and you will likely not be disappointed with the look of the game.\\n\\n-Cons: You can still play with a poor graphics card without lag, but to actually get high end graphics you need a really good one, so don't expect the game to look too good with a low end machine.\\n\\nMusic/Vibe:(gonna shorten it from here)\\n\\n-Pros: Good atmosphere, nice to listen to\\n\\n-Cons: Nothing outstanding, some tracks repeated from first game\\nEconomy:\\n\\n-Pros: Nothing too hard to grind for and no hidden percentages/terrible rng in place, not unfair\\n\\n-Cons: Lootboxes exist, and while it certainly isn't pay2win as most lootbox orcs are not viable or interesting, they are still very unneeded and greedy.\\n\\nTLDR: The game is fun, and for those who have enjoyed the first one they will enjoy this one, however it falls flat in several places and is riddled with flaws. If unsure don't buy for the full price, but if you have the money and its on sale, go for it, its not a game that will hurt most people to play. \\n\\nLastly, I trimmed a lot of fat in the review, and couldn't say everything, but I hope you found this review helpful! :)\",\n",

       "  'review': \"❝ Lovely fortress you have here. Correction: lovely fortress I have here. ❝ \\n-A random orc\\n\\n[h1] 💻 Description: [/h1]\\nShadow of War nowadays is considered a [b] must [/b] have game for the diehard fans of the L.O.T.R. franchise. Even though it does not follow the story of the book, it describes an amazing adventure that can please even the most demanding players. Like its predecessor, Shadow of Mordor, the game is an epic story-driven action RPG game, where you utilize the power of the ring to its full potential. You fight and recruit armies of orcs that sometimes lead to epic battles, alliances and even betrayals. I enjoy the game in its highest difficulty since it adapts to the needs and the playstyle of the player.\\n\\n[h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1]\\n[h3] Summary [/h3]\\nIn Shadow of War, we are following Talion who is still infused with the ancient lord Celebrimbor, in their attempts to defeat the Dark Lord. This time, both travel to Mount Doom, where they forge a new Ring of Power, free of Sauron's corruption. Celebrimbor believes that the ring could be controlled, thus giving the wielder the ability to become the new King. Talion, who is not as interested in power, believes that Celebrimbor`s cause is just and they both decide to face Sauron and his Nazgul army in Mordor.\\n\\n[h3] Development [/h3]\\nShadow of War’s plot is a very delicate matter. As mentioned before, the game sometimes even completely breaks the lore, with the addition of characters like Shelob or the necromancer Zog etc… The fanbase was quite mad with some of the character progression, and the ending frustrated the hell out of the community as well. I agree with some statements, but not all of them are accurate for the reasons mentioned below. During your whole playthrough, the stronger emphasis is on the relation of Talion and Celembrimbor. Both begin to question their motives, as according to them, peace should be achieved differently. Celembrimbor’s opinion revolves around control, whereas Talion’s opinion around freedom. They both make valid points and force the player to question the morality of the cause, thus giving a neat touch to the interactive nature of the game.\\n\\n[h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1]\\nThe free-flow combat as well as its parkour aspect are both thrilling and mesmerizing at the same time. You can really ‘feel’ the power of the ring, as its combos and the surprising changes in certain ‘loved’ (by fans) abilities leave a special charm. The skill tree in my opinion is very well made and you can always switch playstyles to adapt to your different needs. Last but not least, the game revolves around repetition, grinding and careful planning, that’s why it takes time before Shadow of War reveals its true potential.\\n\\n[h3] Progression [/h3]\\nI enjoyed the different unique personalities you encounter during your playthroughs, both by ncps and protagonists alike. The main cast express feelings that can be relatable to our own. Their interactions concerning death and defeat, approach those of the true world, thus making their conversation more memorable and appealing. Furthermore, their adventures are not l. The lore has been tweaked, depending on the needs of the game. Shelob, as we all know is not considered a valid character in the books. On the contrary, she is just a deadly spider. This is not the problem though. I personally welcome changes, as long as they are properly made. However, certain plot holes can not be unnoticed. For example, the ability to summon Balrogs by certain [b] special [/b] orcs was baffling to me. How the hell can an orc move a stick and at the same time revive a demon? At least explain the process. Overall, the plot is decent but I cannot compare it to its supreme [b] gameplay [/b] style.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898678773\\n[h3] Scaling [/h3]\\nEquipment is primarily obtained by defeating Orc Captains and completing missions in Shadow of War. More difficult Orcs with higher rarities will drop gear that matches their rarity. You can upgrade the gear in the future, to match your level by coins or by completing a given [b] challenge [/b]. Legendary armour sets provide bonus stats, making Talion a deadly machine. During your adventures, you will encounter orcs with different specialities and levels. The rarity varies from common to legendary. What rarity Orcs spawn at, is out of your hands, however, it is worth tracking them down and claiming them as your own. That's why, look carefully at the nemesis system, since some orcs are very rare to encounter! Most of the time, higher tier Orcs will have some immunities and strengths. You can exploit them to your advantage, by tracking down a [b] Worm. [/b] For example, some orcs are immune to arrows etc... [b] Fortress captains [/b] tend to have more strengths than weaknesses, so be careful with that. Plan your ambush and get prepared before joining a fight.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898677633\\n[h3] Nemesis system [/h3]\\nEven though certain aspects remain the same like in the original, some tweaks make it more interactive and thus more enjoyable than the previous game. It is high risk - high reward play in other words, so choose your approach carefully.\\n\\n[b] You can send death threats [/b] \\nIn that way, you upgrade the gear quality obtained by an enemy orc. On the downside, the targeted champion comes well prepared, setting a trap of his own. The encounter becomes harder and you risk defeat. \\n\\n[b] Orc development [/b]\\nIt feels like magic how each orc evolves, depending on whether you make them an ally, shame them or simply cut them into pieces. I humiliated an orc so many times, that after some point he became obsessed with me! Your actions now have consequences, so do not be surprised if an enemy or ally champion cheats death, just so that he can serve you or even worse, kill you.\\n\\n[b] You can send ambushes [/b]\\nAlly champions join the fight. Encounters become easier, but you are risking the life of your companion. With this strategy, you can also level up your orcs!\\n\\n[b] You can send spies to infiltrate the enemy lines [/b]\\nYour champion needs to defeat an enemy captain in the [b] the arena [/b] to take the enemy's place. There are lots of benefits to this technique. However, there are also some risks. If your orc is defeated in the arena or for some reason is caught by the fortress master. Then, it is guaranteed you will bid him fair well, as he gonna meet his maker (forever ???). If he wins though, he may even become the personal bodyguard of [b] the Fortress Captain. [/b]\\n\\nIt feels like magic how each orc evolves, depending on whether you make them an ally, shame them or simply cut them into pieces. I humiliated an orc so many times, that after some point he became obsessed with me! Your actions now have consequences...\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898679507\\n[h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1]\\nMicrotransactions were among the core problems of the game back in the day. However, this has changed making it more approachable and thus more appealing for us the players. The Blade of Galadriel DLC for me was a nuisance. Of all the protagonists Eltariel is the least favourable, but that’s another story for another review. The developers expanded the universe without reason. They tried to milk the already beloved concept, without putting much thought into the consequences. That was a bad move and they paid it in the end dearly.\\n\\n[h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1]\\nFor the first time after so many years, we the L.O.T.R. nerds finally got a game that truly deserves our attention and respect! Came for the plot, stayed for the combat...\\n\\n-In memory of Garl Warmonger ([b] Legendary [/b]) orc.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'One does not simply parkour into Mordor.\\n\\nJesus Christ the voice acting on the orcs… is beautiful. \\n\\nFinally just bought the game last year. First thing that popped up in the main menu was WB saying that they have taken the market out of the game due to player base dissatisfaction. Just wanted to thank you all older players for making it happen. 😘\\n\\nI had a lot of fun with this game. Basically, if you enjoyed Mordor, then I’d say yes  Shadow of War is worth it. It expands on the previous game by giving you new ways to fight and travel. Enemies are more varied, and captains are harder to kill. \\n\\nIt’s also less buggy than the first game and has a bunch of quality of life improvements. The dlc campaigns are fun too as the characters have different abilities.\\n\\nI personally had an amazing interaction through the nemesis system right after I unlocked dominating Uruks. I was running through a fortress in the open world, and saw a bunch of Uruks standing around some grog barrels which I promptly exploded with some elf shot. All of a sudden, this Olog-hai captain comes storming out in an ambush and yells “MY GROG!” His title was “the Brewmaster” and I made him my bodyguard. \\n\\nEvery time he saved me after in last chance finishers, he would smash the other guy’s head in with a mace and turn to me to say “You look like you could use a drink boss!”\\n\\n10/10 would get saved by a drunken, grog-brewing war troll again.\\n\\nAnyhow, from what little I got from the game, Middle-earth seems to have a really interesting and deep lore behind it. They should consider making a trilogy of movies around it. It would probably do really well.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Man oh man do these guys know how to make a good game... and ruin it.\\n\\nGood Stuff:\\n\\n-The game, like its predecessor, is based around the combat and nemesis systems, which are a whole lot of fun to explore\\n-There are more environments than the first game, new enemies, more upgrades, and even an alright loot system\\n-The story is decently engaging (until it isn\\'t)\\n-Enemies have more diverse and immersive personalities\\n-I love killing those dumb orcs\\n\\nBad Stuff:\\n\\n-The game gets stupidly repetitive:\\n\\nCombat is fun but gets old after a few dozen hours (which you will need to complete the game). The last part of the game is just the exact same seige mission over and over and over and over and over and over with no cutscenes or story section to break it up. They made this last part of the game solely to keep you playing for longer so there\\'d be a higher chance of you caving in and buying one of their stupid stupid loot boxes. I\\'m severly disappointed in the direction the game took towards the end.\\n\\n-The story WAS nice...\\n\\nI\\'m no critic, but I thought the game\\'s story for the first 3/4 of the game was pretty interesting. The issue is, the story after the final part begins -- specifically that it doesn\\'t exist. I expected my many unanswered questions to be answered as well as some big resolution, which the player deserves after replaying the same mission 20 times, but I got none of it. Once you finish the last quest a cutscene begins that basically says \"The end\". Big let down on this front.\\n\\n-The controls are clunky\\n\\nIt often doesn\\'t feel like you have very precise control over the character. From time to time you\\'ll find yourself swinging at the wrong enemy or nothing at all (ruining your combo counter) and climbing is an absolute nightmare if you dont have a clear path upwards.\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt really felt like they just stopped developing the game once the final chapter began. They just reused the same quest, developed no story, and added almost nothing to spice up combat (which you have a LOT of ahead of you) all while not-so-inconspicuously pushing you to engage in their microtransaction system.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s a lot of fun and is worth the buy. You\\'ll be satisfied while playing it but disappointed and a little let down after finishing it. I\\'m a completionist so I progress through the game pretty slowly, taking about 90 hours to beat it. For someone who likes to speed through games they\\'d probably have at least 30 hours to look forward to. \\n\\nI\\'m mad at the developers and want to tell you not to buy it, but I can\\'t deny that it gave plenty of entertainment.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Score: 9/10\\nTime to 100%: 65 hours (Main game + DLC)\\nSimilar games: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/209000/Batman_Arkham_Origins/]Batman: Arkham Origins[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/11450/Overlord/]Overlord[/url]\\n\\nYou know those games that are just so much fun that you can\\'t put down until you\\'ve completely sunk hours and hours into them, have to play constantly and consistently until you\\'ve done absolutely everything in them until about a week or two later you\\'ve found it\\'s finished, it over now and you\\'re a little disappointed in that because you wanted more, more, more? Shadow of War is one of those games. An absolute joy to play and difficult to put down until it\\'s been absolutely exhausted. \\n\\nPros:\\n\\n[b]Fighting Mechanics[/b] - If I was to describe the mechanics of this game, I would closely compare it to the Batman: Arkham series when it comes to the physical combat. But there\\'s more to it. You also take into account when you\\'ve fighting the orcs, you look at their strengths and weaknesses and try to combine that in your battle against them. Maybe there is an orc weak to fire? A possible strategy is luring him to a barrel or campfire and lighting that baby up and watching him flee. This is a game where you mix fighting, stealth, strategy, domination (taking over the orcs), amongst other things during your combat which leads to very satisfying gameplay.  \\n\\n[b]The Orcs[/b] - If I could pick one element from this game that seperates it from all other games and say \"This is why, this is why you should try this game\", it\\'s the orcs themselves. There are hundreds of possible combinations of orcs that you can possibly meet on your travels and it creates some real water cooler effects of conversation between others who have played the game, where people have their own stories of the orcs they have met and fought against. On a fighting level the orcs are separated into fighting classes. You\\'ll see tanks, beastmasters, marauders, warriors, assasins and several others. They then have their own tribes, which again adds additional abilities to their fighting style. On top of this is that they also have their own personalities. Some with bite at you, scream at you, taunt, sing or make weird clickly noises at you. Each time you meet a new orc is always a joy as to what kind of character you are about to meet, and in your travels you will find a few highlights.\\n\\n[b]Story[/b] - Although ultimately forgettable, I found the storyline to be very entertaining throughout. If you haven\\'t played the previous game you may be wondering, \"Do I need to play the first game to really enjoy this one?\", and the answer is not really. Long story short from the first game (which comes from the beginning of the game), guy gets killed along with family, guy seeks revenge, guy kills all those responible. One or two slight differences but that\\'s basically it. When it comes to this game, the most interesting part of the storyline actually came towards the end, when it goes more into the Nazgul. As someone who has watched and loved all the movies, but haven\\'t read the books or anything - I thought that shedding more light on them, who they are and how they came to be was very interesting and it was something I never really thought about from the movies.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n[b]Technical Issues[/b] - So when I first got the game I had a real difficult time even getting it to play. It would just show that it was running on Steam for a solid 5 seconds only to go off again and not start the game at all. This took me HOURS AND HOURS to fix. Firstly, I needed to reinstall the C++ Redistributable from 2015 which worked, but that was only the first part. The problem then changed into another thing, it\\'s solution, after all these years of gaming, was one of the most bizarre technical fixes I\\'ve ever come across. I had to - get this - update Internet Explorer. Excuse me, what? Yes, that\\'s right. I had to update a browser I never even use or give a toss about. The solution came from Warner Brothers Games themselves as seen [url=http://support.wbgames.com/link/portal/24022/24028/Article/1882/Direct3D-11-1-API-not-available-error]here[/url]. But whatever, it worked in the end. \\n\\n[b]Endgame[/b] - When you get to the last stage of the game it gets quite jarring. What was previously a very dynamic, intriguing story with lots of different things happening quickly becomes a grindy-chore. The story comes to a screeching halt and you\\'ll find yourself repeating the same thing over and over again like 20 times before the game comes to an end. It was very suprising how lazy and tacked-on it felt considering how entertaining the game was up to that point. \\n\\n[b]Microtransactions[/b] - The ever pervasive, constantly shoved down our throats issue that plagues many triple A games of our time, Shadow of War is also inclusive with microtransactions. It\\'s not as bad as in some other games, where it feels like a necessity to purchase to avail the full experience of the game, but it\\'s still annoying. You\\'ll find top tier orcs and gear (known as legendary gear in game), but of course they\\'ll be found at a much rarer rate so that you may be tempted to buy these things. I went through the entire game without spending a single microtransactional penny, so it\\'s certainly possible, but it\\'s still a minor gripe. Also to be expected with AAA games there is DLC. This DLC is availbe any time, but storywise tacked on after the game\\'s ending by the way.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Generally Speaking\\n\\nAfter all this time I missed a good open world game with a nice dynamic world with story and I found it in Shadow of War.\\nThis game does everything Shadow of Mordor does but better smoother and with more refined combat. Every battle and siege is different you have  different options. You can dominate warchieft to become your spies in sieges or you can kill them all for a easy conquest. You can send Graugs and Trolls or you can prefer riding a drake for your siege. Same goes for defend side you can get better walls or spiked ones to prevent orcs from climbing. There so much option that I cant tell. I mainly focused on siege mechanic because half of the game takes place in those missions and this missions are how they promoted this game. \\n\\n\\nWhat Happed to loot boxes?\\n\\nThey removed the in game purchase of in game  currency but nobody talks about it.\\nYes they removed microtransactions. Everybody yelled to WB and monolith for lootboxes\\nbut when they removed it nobody talks about it.(Interesting)\\nBy the way you can still open lootboxes in game but you get in game money from daily challanges you completed.There is no way you can buy in game currency not anymore.\\n\\n\\nHow About Story?\\n\\nStory is better than Shadow of Mordor and decent for a open world game like this I really liked it actually but in some points there was plotholes in them. And it was a bit short cut.they could have give us more information on act 4 s Talions battle againts Sauron but they rather prefered to put bit of it in Blade of Galadriel DLC. I watched the cutscenes I did not buought dlc s because they were to short and I enjoy more playing with Talion and Bright Lord Celebrimbor himself. Missions were also better designed and more interesting thist time and there is a diffrent type of missions which is sepereted from each other. \\n\\n\\nWhat Happened to Nemesis System?\\n\\nNemesis system is at its best. More dynamic and complex then ever. There is new missions orcs, beasts,  skills and abilities that changes your play style. Also this time around Talion have better customization settings both on abilities and gear. There is a new skill tree with new skills. \\n\\n\\nAny Downsides?\\n\\nOnly downside of the game is Shadow war (act 4) is a bit long and can give you a headache. And Graphics does not have the same dept as Shadow of Mordor. Contrast is bad lighthing is terrible and Talions new face looks like a dead cavemen. But I can still recommend this game because of the epicness of battles and combat. You should \\ndefinitely buy it if you liked Shadow of Mordor and Lotr lore.\\n\\nMy point to this game is:\\n84 / 100',\n",

       "  'review': \"Y'know, I honestly wish more games were like this.\\n\\nYou start with 'I want to make a game where you play one dude against a whole army of orcs'. Simple, elegant premise, guides your design principles the entirety of the way. Then you start to work on each little piece, like 'how does an ambush look?' 'How do fortresses function?' 'What would fighting an overlord look like?' and that leads to more complicated questions, like 'how do orcs feel about tenants of warfare?' 'what natural weapons can be available to take on a fortress as one person?' or 'how would an orc design his throne room?'\\n\\nAnd then you get to think about what made the dude the way that he is that he's happy to fight an army by himself, and you start to wonder about the kind of people around him, and how they might treat him, and how he might come to treat those around and under and above him.\\n\\nAnd then, presumably, you look up at some point after a while and you've designed an entire system that provides for dynamic enemies, the presence of cultural influences, governing principles for allies and enemies, particular combat styles and approaches, a loot system that seamlessly interlocks with the questing system and a vibrant and complex skill tree. And you probably think to yourself 'man, all I set out to do was tell a story about one man verses a whole army! How did all this sociology and psychology and architecture and RNG get into this?'\\n\\nA lot of good art starts with a single concept, sincerely supported to a natural conclusion. Under that definition, this game is good art. It may be defined (for better or worse) by the fascination with ultra-violence endemic to most video games, but I see a sign of something greater than just an evening distraction here, and that isn't just the shine and sparkle of the AAA property it takes its concepts from. Highly recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I normally only review games I complete. In this case, I'll break the tradition. Shadow of War isn't a bad game, but it's not a great game. It's exciting and fun for the opening but soon hits tedium - game nemesis, play missions, capture fort, rinse and repeat in different environments. I feel like they made the game TOO big, and should've stuck with what worked in Shadow of Mordor while expanding on that game. There's nothing particularly bad about this game, but after 15-20 hours you will be doing the same thing again and again for another 20 hours. The graphics are good, the combat is pretty good (same as Shadow of Mordor), Nemesis is bigger than ever, but the unimaginative fortress captures just don't seal the deal. I was a big fan of Shadow of Mordor and left feeling disappointed - repeating the same process in 5-6 locales was not very engaging. Maybe I'll go back to it some day but I wish I would've waited for a deeper discount.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'THE MICROTRANSACTIONS ARE GONE!\\n\\nThat\\'s when I decided to pull the trigger. Bought it when real money purchases were shut down, and I was still playing as the full Market closure occurred.\\n\\nThe Market and its surrounding decisions were the reason I didn\\'t buy this game at $90CAD. Instead, I waited for the patches and bought it at $30CAD. Their loss, which I nightmarishly figure the whales may have made up for.\\n\\nTHE GAME ITSELF:\\n\\nIf you liked Shadow of Mordor, this is a solid step forward. Gameplay is generally more of the same, but it\\'s got more ways to progress, more stuff to do. A little bit more RPG, and a truly full fledged Nemesis System. I loved the Fortress assaults, I even really enjoyed the online stuff.\\n\\nClose to 100%\\'d the main story, minus some of the more boring collectibles, and felt I got great value out of it. If you go through the whole thing, it\\'s definitely a good deal longer than its predecessor, which I was able to 100% at ~24 hours.\\n\\nI haven\\'t checked out the DLC yet but from the descriptions of them in-game they sound like \"more of the same.\" Around the 50 hour mark I\\'m feeling about done with the game, but great stuff.\\n\\nA future Shadow of ______ game that takes the Nemesis, Army, and Fortress management systems up to the level of simulation in Total War - and perhaps some online co-op? - would be a game to treasure.\\n\\n*EDIT*\\n\\nDLC 1: Blade of Galadriel. This was a fun little mini-campaign where you play as a female Elf assassin. There are a few new skills and small mechanics around them, otherwise the gameplay is the same. The DLC is very short, my in-game timer reports 3 hours and 20 minutes to beat the missions and collect a few sets of optional Legendary gear on top. The mission complexity was very dumbed down, and that\\'s compared to the main game missions which are not setting any industry records. Enjoyable but low value.\\n\\nDLC 2: Desolation of Mordor. Another mini-campaign, but longer (still in progress!), where you play as Baranor, an NPC of the main game. This is the most Batman Arkham that the game ever becomes, complete with grapnel system and gliding. You can also consider it an \"Iron Man\" mode, since you only have one life. However, by the time you get through the game and try this, and with a liberal healing system, it\\'s not that easy to die. Enjoyable, but also low value.\\n\\nDLC 3+: The Tribes etc. These are just extra Loot/Gear/Orc collecting missions scattered all over the map, with each new Tribe including new Legendary Gear sets. The main game without these extra Tribes is more than plenty, so their value is very low.\\n\\nDLC CONCLUSION:\\n\\nNot poorly done, but it is two fairly short, samey, good quality DLC and some useless DLC. It\\'s worth a few bucks, but for 95% of prospective players the base game is more than enough.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Shadow of War is one of 2017’s biggest disappointments for me. While its Nemesis system is better than ever, the rest of the game provides a flawed and repetitive experience with some unpleasant practices integrated into the menu.\\n\\nImagine a single player game that advertises its microtransactions and season pass every time you pause. That may not sound too bad, but I easily spent at least forty percent of the game digging through the bloated and slow menu system. I must have seen them hundreds of times. In addition to that nonsense, you have the (microtransaction) Market section, filled with Gold and Mithril Chests that promise epic or legendary items and orcs. Other things you can spend your premium currency on include experience boosts and Featured Friday Chests™. \\n\\nNot everything requires real money in the Market. You can spend your Mirian (in-game currency) on somewhat useless Silver Chests and redeem rewards tied to the online component of the game (Online Vendettas and Sieges). Those delicious rewards trigger a glowing circle right next to the Market in the menu, you know, to make you click on it. That way you can be exposed to more of their premium offerings since they’re all mixed in together. It’s just the other way the game is engineered to advertise its boxes to you. There is some serious free-to-play mobile game design philosophy wrapping its glistening, bulging arms around Shadow of War.\\n\\nNow that we’ve covered that nasty part of the game, let’s talk about the Nemesis system. It’s good and the orcs make it fun and interesting. You’ll run into and be killed by poet orcs, orcs that don’t know how to stay dead, and orcs that will save you time and time again (to my horror, which I’ll go over later). Their responses to the numerous situations that can occur within the game impressed me. The voice actors put in some great performances as the orc and olog captains, especially when you earn the ability to shame them into insanity (highly recommended).\\n\\nUnfortunately, the game overstays its welcome with its forgettable story and unlikable protagonists. The elf ghost seems unable to say anything that doesn’t involve the word Palintír™ and Talion doesn’t really develop or seem interesting. Shelob is apparently eye candy with her fine humanoid form and has a unexpectedly dumb storyline tied to her memories (one type of collectable in the game) that becomes apparent when you gather all of them. The other characters in the game are a slightly better while the orcs are #1. They have much more entertaining and interesting personalities than everyone else.\\n\\nThe other big problem with Shadow of War comes in the form of highly repetitive and somewhat frustrating gameplay. If you’re the type that can’t help collecting collectibles, then you’re in for a boring and tedious ride. One of the worst parts about hunting them down is having to climb a tower that activates a mini-game that involves scoping out the territory until your crosshair shrinks enough to discover it when you’re close enough. Some of them have interesting lore pieces attached and others, not so much.\\n\\nThe combat varies greatly in its quality depending on the encounter. You can easily find yourself spamming dodge or counter for extended periods of time if the captain has the right combination of immunities and traits. Some enraged captains will endlessly lunge at you if they’re Enraged leaving no room to do anything else until they chill out. Sometimes you’re stuck kiting the enemy or you’re facing a tank who keeps healing over and over again (don’t waste your time and run away until you’re at a higher level). Other times, you’re being clever with all your tools and feeling pretty great about your conquest. Then again, you could end up becoming uncomfortably intimate with the game’s horrible targeting and wasting a powerful attack on an unintended victim. It’s a somewhat common occurrence with groups.\\n\\nOther issues involve traversal and glitches. Talion seems to have a fetish for climbing and will lovingly attach himself to any surface that’s nearby when running around. I’ve accidentally started climbing up a wall, pillar, or structure when just trying to travel from point A to point B. This problem happens frequently and with mounts too, especially graugs. However, the inclusion of the double jump was a very good choice and was fun to use. As for the glitches, I fell through the world once, witnessed silent speeches, and more. For the most part, my 33 hours didn’t have many technical problems and the loading times were fantastic on my HDD. \\n\\nThe mission design could have used a better touch too. Too often would I be going out of bounds in an open-world game. And it’s not a matter of running 1000m in the wrong direction, the arbitrary boundaries are poorly placed to the point of causing mission failure and having to restart. It’s aggravating to see that message pop up and doubly so when it causes a restart. Let me use the environment to my advantage instead of forcing me in a weirdly confined space in a game where you’re normally able to move freely. Since orc speeches are unskippable, you can expect to hear plenty of repeated dialogue if you happen to run into a very difficult fight.\\n\\nThe game has a weird grind going for it towards the end. Recruiting orcs means not collecting sweet loot off their dead bodies so each one has an opportunity cost between an item or convert, making the purchase of chests more attractive. I’m glad I got the Act 1 Starter Pack for 50% off with the 500 real currency Mirian which helped me stay geared up. Leveling up slows down too so again, I’m glad I ended up with a handful of 2-hour 100% experience boosts.\\n\\nLastly, I don’t understand the balance in this game. The combat balance seems off when it comes to the difficulty level. Normal is too easy and Nemesis removes nearly all the hitstun that Normal difficulty has. I found Nemesis to be an exercise in frustration since some missions could end up turning into huge difficulty spikes while repeating the mission on Normal made it a cakewalk. You can tune the difficulty at any time, but nothing can fix that weird gap between the two.\\n\\nI lied, one more thing, before I forget. That heroic orc that kept saving me wasted my time. The upgrade system for items involving fulfilling some requirements that function like a mini-quest of sorts. The legendary ones tend to favor recruiting very specific orcs of a certain level, tribe, and class. This means staring at the Army section of the menu and going through the orcs until you find the right ones. You might even have to pass time if you don’t see any available. Now when I found the right kind of orc twice, they didn’t have the correct level. My plan was to let them kill me so that they could level up and allow me to upgrade my items when I recruited them. However, this one orc I recruited could not resist saving me and when he did, he delivered a one hit killing blow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Nemesis system and great orc voice acting carry this game hard. 2.5 out of 5 stars would be awarded based on that and the positive aspects of combat alone. Numerous things rubbed me the wrong way though and I cannot bring myself to recommend Shadow of War to anyone. Maybe at 40-50% off. It’s a horribly bloated experience with a sluggish menu. They needed to trim down a few things and go with refinement instead of having such a busy menu with too many functions. Oh, I do like the Photo Mode. Make sure to give that a “shot.” Hyuck.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I am writing this review in an attempt to further debunk the myths regarding MTX, while giving a small comment on 'game is good'.\\n\\nFirstly, the game: it is basically a MUCH better sequel to Shadow of Mordor. Everything is more expansive, intuitive, polished, and entertaining - and we even have many new features, as can be seen in the trailer. While many sequels are disappointing letdowns, this is exactly the opposite: it has improved on every aspect of SoM to some degree or another, and added much more on top of that. So if you liked SoM, I predict you will love SoW. If SoM left you feeling kind of 'eh'... well, SoW is still much better, but it might not be for you. Take that into consideration before buying at full price, and if you're the latter, maybe wait for a sale.\\n\\nNow, regarding the MTX that everyone is in an uproar about. I am not biased. I've played dozens of games with MTX, and many hundreds more without them. I liked SoM, and was slightly put off by SoW MTX when I first heard about them. But I took a dive and after I started playing the game, understanding the mechanics, and got a look at the bigger picture, these are my thoughts on the MTX situation:\\n\\n1. MTX are not required for any part of the game - I cannot stress it enough, but don't let anyone convince that they are needed at all. They're implemented in such an unintrisuve way, that they're almost superfluous in how useful they are.\\n\\n2. Nothing in the MTX is 'exclusive' - that is to say, anything you can get in the MTX, you can easily acquire with a little game play. And I do mean a little - legendary orcs and gear are not difficult to acquire AT ALL.\\n\\n3. You get free gold (MTX currency) from daily challenges that are basically just additives, since the daily challengs mostly happen by you just playing the game normally. So in reality, the MTX boxes are more like extra quest rewards to get a few legendary orcs for free. You also get tons of lootboxes from other sources, such as online 'revenge missions' against orcs that have killed other players, or completing some challenges for boxes directly.\\n\\n4. It's strongly believed that Monolith did NOT want to put MTX in their game, and that this is a move by Warner Brothers. I suggest people check out some basic guidelines on the publisher / developer relationship, but here's the gist: the publisher (WB) said they want MTX, and the developer (Monolith) must comply. Don't blame Monolith, I can't imagine they'd be dumb enough to do this.\\n\\n5. A special mention on the endgame stage of the game, Shadow Wars. Many people are talking about how the 'true end' of the game is locked behind a paywall. What they are ignoring is that the Shadow Wars is probably the best part of the game. Many people are even calling for an 'endless war' mode, wherein you can endlessly defend, attack, and reclaim forts. Sure, Shadow Wars takes a fair bit longer compared to the other acts... but it's probably the best part, so who cares? For those of you that can't wait to see the true ending, like that's all you care about or something and not how fun the game happens to be... well, gosh, if only there was a place that people could go to watch videos shared by millions of other people, that likely had the 'true ending' within the first couple of days.\\n\\n6. The game is still amazing, and should not be discounted just because of the MTX. I can understand wanting to wait for sales, or GOTY edition, or bundles or whatever... but saying you will NEVER play the game because it supports MTX Is asinine. Instead, but the game, and don't buy MTX. They track their income streams, and will see how many of you decide to buy the MTX, and how many don't - that will send a better message.\\n\\nHope this review helps some of you formulate a more educated decision on whether or not to get the game. Have a great day!\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'While I do recommend this game because it is fun in many ways, I can also say that this game has caused me many hours of rage. I honestly wish I could give it a rating of \"Meh,\" because that most accurately reflects my feelings about this game.\\n\\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]Orc variety and personalities are fun and engaging\\n[*]Capturing fortresses feels satisfying\\n[*]Voice acting is done well (but with Troy Baker, what else did you expect?)\\n[*]Music is fun and diverse\\n[*]Environmental graphics are gorgeous\\n[*]5 different map locations with dramatically different environmental aesthetics (snow, lava, forest, ruins, etc.)\\n[*]You can ride drakes now, which is the ONLY way to travel!\\n[*]Armor actually looks really cool if you take the time to level it up\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]Target priority in combat is bullshit (no, I did NOT want to perform my Dominate ability on the archer behind the Captain I need for my army!)\\n[*]Parkour is so buggy\\n[*]This game takes a dump multiple times on the established lore of Middle-Earth, especially with Shelob (as a hardcore LotR nerd, this pissed me off to no end)\\n[*]Story is very dull, and you can see almost every twist coming from a mile away\\n[*]Defending your fortresses is such a drag\\n[*]Leveling up your orcs is a pain in the ass\\n[*]The AI is sometimes so dumb that your captain will literally sit there and get spanked to death by another orc 20 levels weaker than himself\\n[*]Some combat bugs WILL kill you\\n[*]The victory speech audio doesn\\'t play when you conquer the last two fortresses before the end of Act 2; this bug makes me really sad, because the speeches Talion and Celebrimbor give are some of the coolest parts of the game\\n[*]Short variety of orc names (I literally had three orcs named Ugakuga in one of my armies; it got confusing)\\n[*]Some orc classes are just plain useless; I never had a Tracker or Destroyer prove helpful in my army EVER\\n[*]Act 3 is considered to be the ending to the game, but it\\'s completely unsatisfying and sudden, which makes you want to continue and finish Act 4 for the \"true ending.\" Speaking of which...\\n[*]ACT 4 CAN GO DIE IN THE HOTTEST FIRES OF MOUNT DOOM\\n[/list]\\n\\nThis game feels like a fortress siege simulator that someone tacked a story onto at the last second. While capturing a fortress is fun and requires a lot of thoughtful setup and strategy, defending those fortresses (which is pretty much the entirety of Act 4) is not nearly as fun, as you basically just juggle one captain fight after another while your defending captains bleed out at a distance because they\\'re very incompetent unless they\\'re a Slayer, Assassin, or Tank class. If they\\'d put as much work into making Defense missions as dynamic and cinematic as Attack missions, they would have been much more fun. This is a shame, because you spend more time defending than attacking.\\n\\nMany have complained about the lootbox system, but I disagree with the assertion that you need them. Yes the idea of lootboxes is dumb and yes too many games utilize it nowadays, but I literally used 3 of the orcs that I drew from them, and they still weren\\'t as powerful as the orcs I got by just playing the game. You absolutely do not need the lootboxes to beat this game, contrary to what some say (and I beat it on the highest difficulty, so I know what I\\'m talking about). The thing you really need to do in order to keep your orcs strong is remember to level up Talion, because your orc followers cannot exceed his level. Just be sure to equip the white runes to your armor and cloak, and you\\'ll level up quickly enough. I reached the max level, 60, before completing Act 4, and I never used a Lootbox XP boost or any other bonuses besides the runes.\\n\\nAnd finally, my thoughts on Act 4... This final part of the game single-handedly makes me want to change my review to \"Not Recommended.\" Acts 1-3 are very story driven and focus on development of Talion and Celebrimbor as they use their new ring of power to turn Sauron\\'s armies against him, and after a climactic conclusion to Act 3 (which had a twist that EVERYBODY saw coming), the game devolves into a grind-fest of nothing but fortress defense missions. THAT\\'S IT. THAT\\'S THE BOWTIE THEY PUT ON THIS PUPPY. YOU HAVE TO DEFEND YOUR FORTRESSES 20 BLEEPING TIMES IN ORDER TO GET THE \"TRUE ENDING.\" But the problem is, you captured the previous fortresses with lower leveled orcs, and now the new orcs attacking you out-level them by at least 15 levels, so now you have to grind XP for all your orcs one at a time before you even begin to tackle all those defense missions. I absolutely hate this part of the game, because it took everything that was fun about playing it (dominating orcs, building your army\\'s strength, and adding upgrades to your fortress) and made it a chore. I was ready to blow my brains out from boredom by the time I finally leveled up my last orc and was ready for the final bout of assaults.\\n\\nWhy do I recommend it after all this? Because it gave me so much satisfaction just by playing it. After all the bullshit, after all the hard work, after all the grinding defense missions, it felt SO GOOD to sit back and watch the final cinematic. This game reminded me of Dark Souls, because it focuses on creating a sense of accomplishment after a difficult challenge. The randomly generated encounters kept it fresh, and in the end, I found it easy to truly immerse myself. Overall, I had fun, even if that fun evolved from tactile fun to the relief of accomplishment. Whenever I dominated an entire pack of Caragors with one move and turned them on their handlers, when one of my orcs leveled himself up only to turn to me and say \"Don\\'t tell me you didn\\'t see this coming?\" as he drew his morgul blade and sicked 3 Captains on me in an elaborate ambush/betrayal, when I pitted two orcs who were blood-brothers against each other and watched them become conflicted about it, when I threw the head of an enemy Warlord off a tower after capturing the fortress, when I caused a Captain who should\\'ve killed me to flee in terror because he was afraid of spiders, when I rode a Graug and ENGAGED IN AN EFFING FIERY FISTFIGHT WITH AN ARMORED BALROG... it all reminded me why I kept playing this game. Behind all the frustration, pointless grinding, and stupid AI, this game is actually fun to play, pure and simple.\\n\\nI can only recommend getting this game if it\\'s on sale for $25-$30 or so. I don\\'t think it\\'s worth more than that, but if you love sandbox games or loved Shadow of Mordor, then you might get a kick out of this one. Just be warned of the frustrations you will have to endure before the game ends.\\n\\n[b][u]HINT[/u]: I found a quick way to level your orcs... Most orcs from the Trickster class will tend to retreat once their health gets halfway depleted. Find a Trickster orc of a very high level (higher than 60 is ideal), and send your lowly leveled orcs to kill/ambush them. Then, help them out in that mission by fighting the Trickster orc yourself, and when he starts to retreat, let him escape. Your orc will get the victory and up to a 20 level boost, and that Trickster orc will still be alive to use the same trick on again. Rinse and repeat this for all the rest of your orcs until they\\'re sitting pretty at levels of 55-60.\\nYou\\'re Welcome![/b]',\n",

But as soon as you open the game and anytime ingame you play and press escape advertisement for lootboxes shows up. Wich is bad.\\n\\nNext Monolith promised everything that was in lootboxes was in open world. This was also a lie. You see in the lootboxes you get scrolls that can customize your orcs. You do not get that in the open world only from lootboxes ( free or Pay boxes ) Below there is a few examples of what you get from lootboxes that is NOT in open world.\\n\\nBattle Training (raises a follower\\'s level by 1)\\nArcher Recruitment (grants a follower an Archer Gang)\\nHunter Recruitment (Grants a follower a Hunter Gang)\\nDefender Recruitment (Grants a follower a Defender Gang)\\nMount Training (Grants a follower a caragor mount) \\nFire Training (Grants a follower a Fire Weapon)\\nEpic Training: Mighty Savages (Grants a follower a boost to the effectiveness of nearby Savages)\\nPoison Training (Grants a follower a Poison Weapon)\\nMount Training Legendary (Grants a follower a Defencive Graug)\\n\\nThis list is INCOMPLETE we do not have all the traits scrolls here there is supposedly many many more locked inside the lootbox system and NOT avaible ingame. Below is a link to the official forum where people asked that this be put into the game and not into lootboxes Monolith preatty much ignored it.\\n\\nhttps://community.wbgames.com/t5/General/Please-make-training-orders-and-reassignment-orders-avaliable/td-p/1656682\\n\\nNext part that is bad about the game is Lootboxes in a single player game was kinda over the line and poorly done IF everything was inside the game offline as well as in lootboxes then ok np but it is not.\\nOther than micro transaction things the game suffers from a little bit repetive gameing syndrome you do aloooot of the same things over and over with very little changes.\\nNow that was the bad parts.\\n\\nLets go to the good parts.\\n\\nGame features a very well made graphics engine and Npcs are well cordinated for the most part.\\n\\nStory is good as far as i gotten and sound actors are good but maybe little bit low on volume and subtitles can be a hit and miss.\\n\\nOptimisation is welldone i tested on my laptop and on my pc and both worked great.\\nhave not encountered any buggs so far wich is good.\\n\\nNemesis version 2 engine is awesome! you will love it.\\nSkill system is a little bit weaird at first glance but you get the hang of it later.\\n\\nYou can respec free of charge at any given time great addition.\\n\\nId say if it was not for the lootboxes this would be a perfect game.\\n\\nNow In conclusion If you do not mind microtransactions and some items being In Lootboxes only then you should buy this game. However if you do have something against microtransaction or you suffer from addiction disorders or similar problems DO NOT buy this game due to sublime advertisements in the menus.\\n\\nI do not know if they will ban people who have fun with the game with mods or cheats or such but i hope they do not since this is a single player game.\\nThere is a multiplayer section of the game but its like not worth mentioning couse its very very basic and limited.\\nanyways there you have my review.\\n\\nPS the amount of bad decisions monolith and warner bros made when releaseing this game made the game dirt cheap before it was even released i got my copy 65% off from a retailer on gold edition.\\nyou can proboly snag this game with gold edition 50% of at any given time from retailers or digital merchants.',\n",

This usually results in him leveling up. His attacks now 1-shot me. He is level 35, I am level 14. I think there is a story mode to this game, but I am too busy trying to kill Zuka the Uncatchable to care about the fate of Middle-Earth.\\n\\n8.5/10, super fun, solid graphics that hold up 4 years after release and runs well.

       "  'review': 'First, My playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steam.\\nI am a rank 100 and play all the factions.  I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.\\n\\nIt is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.\\nAfter so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin\\'s enemy.\\n\\nThere are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:\\n\\n1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).\\nNow the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)\\n\\n2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.\\n\\n3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.\\nBut I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.\\n\\n\\nThere are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. \\n\\nBut i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. \\nWarthunder \"can\"  become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.',\n",

       "  'developer_response': \"1. Yes, that is important part of good gameplay - the ability to find game quick enough.  But we are avoiding 'impossible to kill vehicle' - so basically you can meet more powerful vehicle than yours but there is a way to kill it anyway.\\n\\n2. All this is misinformation.\\n'There is no cheats' was never stated at all. This is part of phrase, switched out of context, from 2013, when there were ONLY TWO game modes - Plane Arcade Battles and Plane Realistic Battles (bot modes are planes only and with markers - so there is no maphack). And full statement was something like 'there is no such cheats in the game like speedhack or invulnerability or kill-all'. \\nMoreoever - those days there were no (at least known!) _working_ cheats at all!\\nALL so-called cheats were those days just malware. And the statement was perfectly clear and correct.\\nThis statement IS CORRECT even nowdays, but with tank battles (especially realistc battles) there are possibility to have maphack or aimbot.\\nWhen RB tank battles appeared WE IMMEDIATELY started work on anticheat solutions, cause hiding marks on tanks in client of course can be bypassed by cheaters - 'nevert trust client' is basics of multiplayer code.\\nAbout 'banning youtuber' - that is also incorrect. That was bad story, when one of our former employees overreact on one youtuber behavior (while youtuber was viloiting public agreement and EULA, btw). The problem was solved and videos restored in 4 days (youtube guys are slow and couldnt make it faster, while we ask them the same day). We apologize for that and perform some more actions and in a good relationship with that youtuber for long time since that.\\nThere issue has nothing in common with cheaters.\\n3. MOST of our work is fixing bugs and working on community reports and feedback.\\nHowever most of players do not understand that there are LOTS of players with DIFFERENT feedback. We have implemented features of years of manwork (for example so called LastManStading) by users suggestions and than remove them from the game by users feedback. Of course, there were different users - those who suggest and those who protest.\\nUser often think that his playstyle and feedback is common and all agree with it, but thats really not that often true.\\nWe have 15th game modes that can be treated as different games (tanks, planes, ship, realistica, arcade, simulator, and moreover - jets, bombers, fighters, assault planes, tank destroyers, tanks, rocket tanks, ATGM tanks and so on - there are really different) and players usually do not play even 25% of the whole game and do not see all the game and all other players feedback and opinions.\\nThis - game variety (and I'm not talking of content even! But we have hundreds of locations and thousands of vehicles that also matters) - can be treated as a biggest game flaw, and, in the same time, as a biggest game advantage and feature - this is the game where you can fight on almost any military vehicle against almost any possible comparable military vehicle in thousands of environments and situations.\\nI know, looking at amount of time you play the game, that you know and feel at least big part of the game, but almost sure that not all - there are not lots of players that experienced in all game aspects.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Okay listen.\\n\\nI\\'ve got 2,222 hours in this game while I\\'m writing this. I get that it\\'s confusing that I\\'m making a negative review.\\n\\nTl;dr: This is a good game, but one of the worst, most scummy products I\\'ve ever seen. One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of ways.\\n\\nAll I really need to do is explain the monetization tbh:\\n\\n-Silver Lions: Silver lions are the non-premium currency for War Thunder. They are achieved passively just by played, and playing well gives a nice bonus. Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ie, if you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you\\'ll get a small amount of silver lions, but even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amount, and to a degree this gets better the better you play). But here\\'s the... well... \"but\". Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the game, no matter what (ie, whether you are completely free to play, just have a premium vehicle, or have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too. Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repair, as do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them). You might be seeing the problem already, but if not stick with me here. As you progress through the game, if you\\'re free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive ones, then things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive. To be clear, all of this so far isn\\'t a big deal. The issue comes when you reach about 7.0 (battle rating, which is basically just a \"level\" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 8.0 for air forces, in my experience. At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive. Buying them, training a crew slot to play them, and every modification all costs SL, but also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle. At the lower tiers you might not even notice this. By about 6.0 you\\'ll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won\\'t be a major issue. You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehicle, but other than that you\\'re fine. But beyond that, certain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarily, though there\\'s always a long winded explanation that boils down to \"balance\") cost bafflingly, ridiculously, hilariously high amounts of silver lions. If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiers, you\\'re golden. You can lose some of it if you have some rough matches, but you\\'ll be fine. At the higher tiers, you could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky. Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it\\'s so expensive you either can\\'t buy it, or can but then can\\'t play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amounts. \\n\\nSo the question is... why? Why is there vehicles in the game that you are punished for playing? Why is the game designed in such a way that you can progress by grinding for hundreds of hours only to be rewarded by being literally unable to play if you have some rough matches? Well, it sorta brings us to the next monetization, but basically, you can buy Silver lions for real money. If you run out you can pay for more. Now full transparency, this isn\\'t technically pay-to-play. It\\'s more like \"pay-to-easily-play-high-tier\". You\\'re not locked out of playing the game, but if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don\\'t have silver lions, you\\'re out of luck unless you have amazing matches. Certain vehicles, like the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair cost, and such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless. Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs. It\\'s awful.\\n\\nSo, next up is Golden Eagles. This is the premium currency. This is nothing new, every F2P game has them pretty much. It\\'s not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle. They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the game, as well as silver lions, premium account time, decals, decorations, ect. Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime. I don\\'t know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot. Still, some are better than others. They\\'re objectively not pay to win, but they are clearly pay to progress. The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it. The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress. It\\'s not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well. But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grind, yes, but you also skip the learning. This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tier, who often teamkill, ram, block, capture-point steal, and otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase. To be clear I\\'m not strictly against this but there\\'s already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do. Again, fine, but it\\'s two clashing playstyles that shouldn\\'t ever really meet. Jets and main battle tanks should, in theory, have the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map design, mechanics and this aforementioned premium issue, they actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiers, and devolve into head-on ramming and head on charges.\\n\\nPremium accounts. Not much to say here. Again, normal for F2P games, but on top of everything above, and everything below, it\\'s a lot. They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions. You progress faster and run out of lions slower. It effects other players in no way, since even if you have a premium account, unless you buy a high tier premium, by the time you get to high tier you\\'ll likely be fairly experienced.\\n\\nConvertible Research. One of the scummiest. Basically you can pay Golden Eagles (real money) to speed up or skip the research of a vehicle. This one just purely prays on frustrated people not thinking clearly who are fed up with the grind. And this game is full to the brim with grind. It is literally endless grind. You will never achieve everything without paying huge sums of real money, but the game loves to tempt you with the fact it\\'s technically possible (until they add the next thing, and they add new vehicles every update more or less). Never, ever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don\\'t feel like doing. Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account). This is a waste of money. Do not use your eagles on this. \\n\\nGaijincoin and the War Thunder Market. Think of the CS:GO or Dota or TF2 marketplaces. It\\'s just that. Turn your money into even faker money which you can\\'t turn back into \"real\" money. There\\'s skins and non-premium but exclusive vehicles on the marketplace. Almost all are event vehicles that required immense grind to get. A few of them are outright overpowered, like the KV-220, and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it\\'s not the worst thing ever. You can get some of this stuff for free easily. Again, this isn\\'t on its own that big of a deal, but keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* game.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a battlepass (Like Dota, Overwatch, Smite ect.).\\n\\nBasically: Every element of this game is designed to squeeze money out of you.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Extremely impressive on a technical and visual level, truly a unique game, sometimes it feels fun to play.. \\n\\nGame is incredibly held back by its economy and developers, which are almost hostile towards the player's time. Even with a premium account the grind is painful and the toxicity of the economy permeates into normal gameplay as losing a match takes a hefty chunk out of your resource gains. Add to this extremely weird balancing at times, and its a recipe for an extremely frustrating experience, where you begrudgingly come back to every now and then because there is nothing else like it.\\n\\nCan honestly not recommend it to any new players. Don't be fooled by the beautiful showcase of modern vehicles either, the store does not tell you that it easily takes a full year of playing to grind to that point unless you put down hefty sums to buy your way in.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin\\'s head office.\\n\\nLet me list the most frustrating aspects of this game:\\nA bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you\\'re signing up for. Also the first serious review I\\'ve done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it\\'s about time I told (warned) people about it.\\n\\nThe devs:\\nHas never listened to it\\'s community\\'s suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said \"no\" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn\\'t figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. \\n\\nThe grind:\\ndear god the insane grind, if you don\\'t get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won\\'t see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation.\\n\\nNew vehicles:\\nAnytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the \"op vehicles.\" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don\\'t address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. \\n\\nThe maps:\\nOnly 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless \"unintended\" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that\\'s right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there\\'s 1 2 or 3. Yup that\\'s all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin\\'s inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT\\'s... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but \"are accurate to a real life location.\"\\n\\nHelicopters:\\nTwo words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won\\'t cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you\\'re in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don\\'t even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you\\'re forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli\\'s. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I\\'m grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I\\'m not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there\\'s 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli\\'s. \\n\\nAir realistic battles: \\nhave 1 single game mode variant and it hasn\\'t changed at all since it\\'s introduction to the game back in 2011. It\\'s fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn\\'t really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they\\'re ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can\\'t respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing.\\n\\n\\nIt reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. \\n\\nGame modes: \\n\\nRealistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren\\'t enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don\\'t even have any for certain BR\\'s (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again.\\n\\nI wish I could have my 2000 hours and countless dollars back.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Allow me to preface this by saying I have been playing this game for years and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game. Whether on premium currency, buying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time. At the time of writing this review I have 240ish days left of Premium time left.\\n\\nI started playing just before they released Ground Forces. The game started out very fun and engaging, but now 1500 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into. They turned a fun game, albeit with a heavy dose of grinding, into one of the least fun games I have played in a long time.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. It looks great when maxed out graphically.\\n2. The variety of vehicles is amazing. (caveat about this later). There are manyt different nations to play as.\\n3. Netcode, while not the best I've seen, is very passable for a Free to Play title, with only minor hiccups throughout my time.\\n4. Bugs and glitches, they definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about them.\\n5. Cross play with either Xbox or PS4, but not with both simultaneously.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Economy, whether for Silver Lions (SL) to purchase things you've unlocked, or Research Points (RP) to actually unlock them, is a slog. It has been only getting worse as time goes by. It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicle(topping out at just shy of 400 thousand RP), let alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle (upwards of 2 million) and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle (2-3 hundred thousand). Keeping in mind, without paying for premium account, you may only get 500-1500 RP and 10-20 thousand SL per match, which can take anywhere from 5-35 minutes.\\n\\n2. Premium currency is very expensive, and some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currency, Golden Eagles(GE). There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying it, as I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over time, but I did not use them myself. There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 1:1 with USD, which is used in the marketplace they created.\\n\\n3. The Marketplace. I hate it. Vehicles sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars, it completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced. It's just like CS:GO skins, only its not just skins. Imagine if you had to buy the AK-47 in CS:GO for $700 before you could use it.\\n\\n4. The balancing is probably the worst offender in the reason for this review. Gaijin has shown over the years that they do not intend to balance the game, going so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them. Standard M.O. for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nations, wait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for players, do it again. It is never a level playing field for every nation. One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nation, every patch. I'm tired of it and its not fun.\\n\\n\\nI could absolutely write more about the game, but I really don't want to give it any more time. Can you have fun with this game? Yeah, sure, but you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great too.\\n\\nFinal Rating:\\n\\nJust watch a Youtube WW2 documentary / 10\",\n",

       "  'review': 'TL;DR: Gaijin is greedy.\\n\\nI have never seen such oppressive monetisation practices in any other game. \\n\\nFirstly, let\\'s talk about repair costs. When your vehicle is damaged or outright destroyed, you will be charged a fee that is paid for with silver lions--the virtual currency you use to purchase vehicles and upgrades. The amount you pay will depend on a number of factors such as how upgraded your vehicle is or the type of vehicle it is itself. The issue is how nonsensical these costs are and how Gaijin determine them. Gaijin claims the costs are for balancing, which is not only misleading, but lying to the entire community.  It is about profit, nothing more. Silver lions can be purchased with real money and the amount awarded after each match can be so little, or even negative, that players are enticed to spend money just to afford the new vehicle they spend hours grinding for. Players can lose up to 50,000 silver lions per match if they don\\'t perform well, and that isn\\'t always the fault of skill; it is a lot of the time down to poor game design. We will get to that soon.\\n\\nNow let\\'s discuss the effect the hostile microtransaction system has on gameplay, because it is horrendous. A massive percentage of players are terrified of dying and then paying excessive repair costs for that vehicle. In ground battles, I recall many instances where 90% of my team would be encamped upon a hill and remain there for the entire match because they didn\\'t want to take the risk of moving across the open field just to get destroyed without getting any score and then incurring the wrath of repair costs. My playstyle can best be described as an aggressive brawler, so when I decide to push and battle over the objective, I will be doing so with only one or two teammates--sometimes none. Gaijin punishes players for losing but at the same time punishes players for taking risks, which seriously hampers gameplay. Players no longer work as a team, they only care about themselves and how many silver lions they will make in a battle.\\n\\nAnother huge flaw with this game is the map design. This is primarily an issue with ground battles for obvious reasons. Gaijin have chosen the \"form over function\" route where you make a pretty map first and work out where everything will go later. These maps are so broken and flawed to the point where your entire team can be spawn camped from the other side of the map. The battle then becomes so one sided due to players, again, not wanting to risk spawning anything to avoid having to pay for the repair costs of dying five seconds in. This causes a spiral effect where teams will rarely make a comeback, as half of the players in said team have understandably returned to the hangar to avoid those repair costs. The newest ground map, Red Desert, has made a lot of good design decisions, primarily with a mostly symmetrical layout. It still isn\\'t perfect, however. Fortunately, you can ban maps from your matchmaking. You\\'ll be paying Gaijin money to do that, of course.\\n\\n\\nOne of the issues with the game\\'s development is the community itself. There are two vocal minorities; the die-hard \"This game is perfect!\" apologists and the \"Frak you, Gaijin!\" toxic man-babies. The apologists appear to be in complete denial regarding any issue that players start discussing, I assume due to the amount of money they have spent on the game, which is an amazing case of Stockholm Syndrome. On the other side, you have the toxic man-babies who just want something to be mad about. An example of this would be a recent update where Gaijin actually lowered the insane repair costs for some vehicles, but these people reacted so negatively to seeing \"economic changes\" without knowing what actually changed, that their outrage seems to have panicked the developers into reverting those changes very quickly.\\n\\nGaijin has demonstrated very little respect for it\\'s community and have done the complete opposite of what creative director Kirill Yudintsev stated in 2014:\\n\"Players happiness about the game (not about us [Gaijin]) is our main prioirty[sic]. We are making changes in the game since its official release based ONLY on players feedback or ideas how[sic] to make game better for them.\"\\n\\nThe only reason War Thunder is popular and successful is because it is unique. There is currently no other competitor that offers a similar experience of realism and variety in vehicles and gameplay. Once a similar game is created and not looked at like a bag of money by those developers, where do you think players will go? Gaijin is out of touch with not only their own game, but their community too. It\\'s an incredible game ruined by greed.\\n\\nI have been playing War Thunder since 2014 and have spent more money on it than I would like to admit. I have never been vocal about the game, nor do I rarely ever leave reviews, but they really are going too far.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Oh boy, War Thunder. After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral review, but as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative one.\\n\\nThe game itself is fun. It's free, so try for yourself. The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind. e.g. Tier V+. The grind has been getting worse and worse, especially without a premium account and vehicles. Not only in research, but also in purchase and running costs. \\nGaijin attempts to balance things by increasing repair costs, which does not really change the balance, but just makes it impossible to play certain vehicles, such as Bombers, for prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit. As a 100% free player, if the unlocking of vehicles doesn't bring you to a halt, then making enough money to actually play them will do the trick. \\n\\nIt's quite a shame because under all the grinding and money sinks, War Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction. Not into a Pay 2 Win, but in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matches.\\n\\nThe worst offender in recent years though, has been the Gaijin market. What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplace, the gaijin market moved away from a community content driven store, where players could sell their vehicle camos and profit, to a more intrusive model, selling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possible. \\n\\nI only want the best for the game, hell, in my over 3000 hours I spent at least 200-300€ on the game and without regret. It is free so whoever is interested should definetly give it a go and check it out, but if you expect to play it entirely for free, you will be in for a long grind with little reward.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"War Thunder is one of those games where you really, REALLY want to love it, but the game does everything in it's power to make you absolutely hate it.\\n\\nThis game has one of the most intricate combat systems ever put into a vehicle-based game, a massive roster of lovingly detailed military vehicles recreated with as much care and accuracy as possible, across land, sea and air and pretty decent graphics and effects that help bring the intensity of the clashes between war machines to life.\\n\\nHowever, War Thunder also has terrible monetization, featuring premium account time, paid currency, premium vehicles, loot boxes and a player marketplace based on, but separated from, the Steam one. The game suffers from poor balancing when it comes to it's vehicles, an awful New Player Experience, tons of powerful or simply unique vehicles being only obtainable at certain points in time or during certain events, locking them out from the majority of the playerbase to an even greater degree than premium vehicles, an economy designed to ensure players will lose money through vehicle repair costs, constant power creep through new updates adding more higher-tier vehicles, absolutely horrible grind that requires months of play to reach the higher tiers and that has not been balanced to account for all the new vehicles added with even higher costs, shoddy matchmaking that sees nothing wrong with pitting a team of newbies against one of highly experienced players and then punishing the newbies for their loss, limited gamemode options with the only PVE option being a lazy horde defense mode and a half-baked anti-ragequitting system that ends up punishing players for accidental suicides or causes outside of their control, such as lost connections and crashes.\\n\\nIf you are just an average joe, looking for a fun game to spend some time with, don't bother with this. Unless you are a fan of military vehicles this game will not appeal to you. If you are a fan of those, then you might be able to tolerate the game's awfulness just for it's subject matter.

       "  'review': 'As a player who\\'s been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire (released September 2020) I\\'m proud and disappointed at the same time of this game.\\n\\nWhen I first started playing, my dreams weren\\'t focused on the F-4E or MiG-21 variants. I stuck to the US tech tree, and the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD-3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me. I wasn\\'t trying to go grind for top tier jets, I just wanted to have fun with what I had.\\n\\nNew Power came (November 2020) and I think that\\'s where this game started to go downhill. New premium jets were being added alongside standard jets, and, as time went on, I started to change my mindset to grind for jets. That\\'s where my problems begin.\\n\\nI can applaud the developers for modeling every single aircraft, but i\\'m not happy because of the grind. Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year - if they were lucky.\\n\\nNow, you may be wondering \"why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it?\" \"what went wrong?\" \\n\\nI gave it a thumbs up because it has the potential to be one of the best combat games out there. Thousands of vehicles, a nice community (no-one really complains about losing or anything or ranting about (X) jet from my experience) the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemic, and more.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s the current problems with War Thunder.\\n1 - The grind is almost unbearable if you have a F2P (Free 2 Play) account\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to grind the US tree with standard planes alone, but that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehicles/bonuses/time.\\n\\n\\n2 - The system is designed to pressure you into spending cash\\n\\nAlthough this is classified as a \"con\", the true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game. Because of this, they have to make packs/vehicles/premium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive. Without cash, they can\\'t manage the servers. Without servers, they can\\'t manage the game because the servers can\\'t be used. Without managing the game, War Thunder will slowly die.\\n\\n\\n3 - Vehicles in Rank IV or V and onward tend to have extremely high repair costs, crew trains, research requirements, and high purchase costs\\n\\nIf you managed to grind a rank V vehicle, you still have to play games in order to get enough currency (Silver Lions) for the vehicle purchase. If you have enough, you still have to deal with a Crew Train (doesn\\'t cost as much as purchase) though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lions.\\n\\n\\n4 - The game needs to decompress\\n\\nIf you never played the game before and don\\'t know what I mean by this, tanks and aircraft have this system called \"Battle Rating\". They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best. Currently, the game has stopped at Battle Rating 10.7 for tanks and aircraft (ships at 6.0/6.3). \\n\\nHowever, the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraft, and, if they don\\'t decompress soon, players may have to deal with F-15s (if they ever get added), F-16s, Su-25s, etc as a F-100 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 10.7 game. F-100s were made in the \\'50s. \\nThey could face aircraft made decades after them \\n(all the vehicles mentioned in this portion of the review were made in the 70\\'s except for the F-100)\\n\\n\\n5 - The team needs to advertise their game better\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what I mean, almost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a top-tier tank, plane, or helicopter (top-tier in the community means modern-day vehicles or similar). \\nSo imagine someone seeing these ads, saying \"oh what a cool M1 Abrams! i can\\'t wait to download and play with it!\" and then downloading the game and realizing that instead of a M1 Abrams, they get a M3 Stuart, a World War 2 era vehicle. \\nThey then see a M1 in the US tech tree, but come to the realization that they will have to go through hours of struggling, grinding, getting enough currency for the vehicle, only to finally get a M1 Abrams that they will have to use at one of the most dreaded battle ratings of the game.\\n\\n\\nIf the game developers fixed some of the issues here, that would improve the quality of their game by a lot. War Thunder has the true potential of being one of the best combat games out there, but the developers don\\'t seem to be trying to fix the current issues, which, if fixed, could have the game be a lot better and live up to it\\'s old status of being one of the best combat games.\\n\\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what goes on within. \\nIf you want to stick to \\'low tier\\',  where it\\'s mostly fun (no grind, no high repair costs, etc) you can, and if you want to play this game for the sole purpose of having fun with early World War Two tanks, planes, or ships, this game would be great for you.\\n\\nThat\\'s all I have to say for now about this game.\\n\\nUpdate (5/21/2021):\\nWith Update 2.7 (Red Skies) introduced via trailers and videos from content creators (it\\'s not out just yet), I have taken a look at the dev server streams and saw that they have fixed quite a few things. Thus, I may do a revised review of the game, though not until the game updates to Update 2.7, because we can\\'t judge books by their cover.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[i]Please read before making consideration:[/i]\\n\\nI am friends with a former Senior Mod from the War Thunder forums. According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right. \\n\\nIf you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.\\n\\nAll that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer. \\n\\nThanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).\\n\\nUpdate: Took a few years off, giving it another shot. Same game mostly, just more monetization.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"extremely frustrating, time consuming and at times even money requiring.\\n\\nThat's how most of the playerbase would describe the game and you can't blame them. It's a terrible game in terms of balance/economy when you get involved in the meta/endgame part. Starting with non existant battle rating decompression leading to unbalanced matches ending with millions of copypasted vehicles in different research trees to make them look fresh and new.\\n\\nTo give someone a better perspective, I've been playing this game since the beta off-steam and this is my review.\\n\\nTiers I-III are relatively easy to grind out, play and enjoy. For all the countries in the game, this  is about 100 hours of solid fun and time to improve at the game, learn the basics and figure out how to fly certain aircraft types, what ammo to use, how to position yourself in a tank, how to climb in realistic battles, how to range your cannon, how to use certain ammo types etc. \\nFor a new player, yes, this is a good source of fun and enjoyment and a must-try for any military fans out there.\\n\\nBut everything above is pain, unlocking modifications for high tier tanks/aircraft to make them competetive and in some cases even viable takes way more and more time and in-game money. RP required and money requirements for new vehicles skyrocket and to top it off, matches get significantly more sweaty with every battle rating increase after you reach tier IV thanks to the absurd amounts of in-game money required for certain vehicles to repair - literally forcing players to actively kill steal / play the risk&reward game - and for someone who is flying their brand new tier IV plane/stock tier IV tank - suffering. \\n\\nThere's a ton of ways to ease off the grind but most of them involve payment through your credit card and others take way too much time to be considered entertaining and this is single handedly the worst part of War Thunder.\\n\\nGive it a try and don't spend your money on it. If you find serious interest, consider getting a premium vehicle/account/talisman and carry on to become a sweaty, salty war thunder redditor and go downvote this review.\\n\\nand just in case someone asks for the ships - yeah, I forgot about them. so did gaijin.\\n\\nedit #1; Lightning is still at 9.7 \\n             helicopters are pay to play\",\n",

       "  'review': 'There should be a support group for players of this game.  I\\'ve heard it said that War Thunder is the game you\\'re almost allowed to have fun with and it\\'s 100% true.  The frustration and emotional damage wrought by War Thunder is a war crime in itself.  You get just enough non-BS matches to keep you hooked while Gaijin panders to select groups just to milk more money from them.\\n\\nEvery vehicle you research just brings you further up the frustration ladder and it doesn\\'t get better until you reach near the top.  Until then?  Well, prepare your hind quarters for an almighty violation.  Unlock a WW2 era tank?  That\\'s ok, you\\'ll be facing Cold War era gear.  Your mighty 1942 heavy tank will be strapped down over and over again by HEAT-FS rounds not developed for 10 years.  Got yourself a brand new, shiny jet?  Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll be fighting other planes outfitted with guided air to air missiles.\\n\\nTo make it even better, you\\'re required to either pay lions (the in game currency) or wait to repair your vehicle.  The costs of those repairs are *supposedly* based on the effectiveness of the vehicle but there are patterns evident that rule that out.  For instance, planes with no guided munitions will cost more than a plane just a step above it that can erase you from existance with nothing more than an afterthought.  But that plane a step above will be half the price.\\n\\nThe game mechanics that sounded so cool when you first read about them?  Just another avenue of frustration.  Volumetric rounds, for instance, are great until they\\'re not.  Theoretically, the rounds have an actual volume, instead of just being the exact pixel you aimed at.  Actually, it\\'s not even that, the exact pixel that Gaijin\\'s screwed up mechanics decided that the round actually went.  That round has volume, but only most of the time.  Sometimes, rounds that should have bounced off due to the armor (if they were truly volumetric) just magically go right through.  \\n\\nWhen you\\'re not dealing with that, you\\'ll be dealing with magic glass that eats every bit of a tank round or pilots being \"knocked out\" with a frequency that defies logic.  Probably 90% of my deaths in a plane are because the pilot was knocked out.  Doesn\\'t matter what kind of maneuvers you\\'re doing or the range you\\'re at.  Gaijin decides the moment that round is fired whether it hits and nothing you do matters in that.  \\n\\nAnd don\\'t even start on the crew levels.  Until you\\'ve nearly maxed them out (a process that *requires* real money, FYI), they\\'re near useless.  Want to turn?  Hope you\\'ve coughed up for the Golden Eagles (currency paid for with real money) to skill them up, otherwise, they\\'ll black out almost instantly.  It gets worse too.  Haven\\'t maxed out that tank crew yet?  Hope you like being killed by invisible tanks hiding behind what amounts to a stick because your crew\\'s spotting skill wasn\\'t high enough.  \\n\\nEvery once in a while though, you\\'ll have a good match.  One where you get paired up with vehicles that are near enough to your own to make it fun and when the almighty RNG-esus smiles upon you, granting your vehicles some semblance of normal performace.  It\\'s just enough to keep you playing but it\\'ll destroy your sanity in the process.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better. If you do that, this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Hi Guys, my name is Drake and as of writing this review i have played Warthunder for 3269.9 hours. i have reached the top tier in 3 countries. yes after 3000 hours. all i have is 3 countries. that is WITH premium time and vehicles speeding progression up.\\n\\nAt its core warthunder is a good game, decently well made. but what truly lets Warthunder down is its developers\\n\\nGaijin is the definition of lie cheat and steal, they do not listen to the players unless they do something so stupid that the whole playerbase revolts, like when they tried to add p2w repairs and boosts for your vehicles. they removed the maus with a nonsense excuse that it was \"too hard to balance\" when really they just wanted to make it and event vehicle to make money off people that want it. they seed old vehicles that you can no longer get to players in lootboxes that you buy with real money from their rip off Great Value TF2/CSGO marketplace where those vehicles litterally sell for THOUSANDS of real life dollars\\n\\nthey can\\'t be bothered to maintain their game at all, there are still bugs in this game from when it launched like 8 year ago, they make players write a fucking essay on the bug for them to MAYBE pay attention to it because none of them even play the game, so they would not know.\\n\\ni have NEVER seen worse spawnkilling in a game. ever, ever ever ever. people target the spawn first because its legal with no punishment. no \"keep out\" zone, 10 seconds of spawn protection for tanks.\\n\\nthe prices for premium vehicles are way too much, 60 dollars for a top tier premium (yes they sell top tier premiums) is a little much man, not to mention thaat if you want to progress in any semblance to a reasonable time you MUST HAVE Premium time.\\n\\ndon\\'t let them lure you in with that shiny Abrams or that nice Apache or that sick F-4 Phantom II because unless you are willing to spend a 1000 hours of your life or open your wallet then you won\\'t get them, infact you wont even get close, about a little under 1 percent of players that start warthunder will reach those vehicles, because you need millions of total rp (research points) to get them, and when you get 2000 rp a game... well you see where this is going.\\n\\nhonestly the only reason i have played this game so long is because all my friends play it and its all my potato laptop can run\\n\\nno review has ever been close to describing all the problems with warthunder and this one won\\'t either. don\\'t even bother as long as gaijin runs the show\\n\\n~ Drakebling\\n\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't in good faith recommend this game. The foundation is solid. The historical accuracy, the plane/tank models, the damage model, are all there, great and very realistic. But all of it is ruined by the economy and questionable developer/balance/gameplay choices.\\n\\nThe progress in unlocking and researching new vehicles is very quick and satisfying in rank 1. But by the middle/end of rank 2 of any nation progress will become increasingly slower, and the cost to buy the already researched vehicles grows more and more, so much so that you can barely afford anything at some point. Almost everything costs silver lions, one of the MANY currencies in game, even the ammunition for each vehicle, and if you don't have a premium account, and at a certain point even if you have one, the mission rewards won't be enough to let you play at higher ranks continuously. It's bad, and it ruins the whole experience. \\n\\nThe worst thing is that, when your vehicle gets damaged in a mission, you'll have to pay silver lions to repair it, OR wait several hours or days for it to repair for free. While in the first few ranks the cost is acceptable as you get rewarded way more than that for each mission, as you unlock more expensive vehicles the repair cost will be too much to be sustainable. Which means you'll probably have to wait up to days to play with that same vehicle again.\\n\\nThis creates a vicious psychological cycle. You don't want to be destroyed in a mission or get your vehicle damaged as when that happens you'll most likely become very frustrated.\\n\\nThe more you advance through the vehicle ranks, the more skill and knowledge is also required. Which is kind of fine, if the game was sustained by a fair economic system and didn't have questionable balance and gameplay designs.\\n\\nI have mostly played with air forces throughout my many hours in game. While the arcade game mode feels pretty balanced, the realistic mode is not. I'll make an example about gameplay and balance design choices that I dislike.\\n\\nIn the last few days I was going through rank 2 of the american air force. There's this airplane, the P-51: when you spawn as a fighter in a realistic battle you will have to take off from an airfield, both factions do. The P-51 has one of the worst climb rate in the game in its rank as a fighter. And it's a boom and zoom plane, which means the plane is required to be at a high altitude and have enough energy/speed to be effective. Since both factions airfields are very close to each other, with that plane you won't be able to climb high enough to have the effectiveness that the plane requires. Even if you side climb, the plane will lose effectiveness once you reach 4000 metres of altitude and beyond due to its engine limitation. And by that time the game is probably already decided, meaning you've spent 10-15 minutes climbing without engaging in any fight whatsoever.\\n\\nI have tried to play the plane differently, using it as a low altitude boom and zoomer, or as a turn fighter. If you play as the former, any other plane which has the altitude advantage over you will gun you down, and there will be. If you play as the latter, every fighter will outperform you and kill you, as the plane turn rate is very bad compared to other fighters. Once an enemy fighter has you in its sight, it's game over. This happened over and over again, as frustration mounted I felt helpless, the plane was basically unplayable. Its only usefulness, then, was to use it as a bomber killer, as at least its guns are formidable: but since most bombers at rank 2-3 will stay at a altitude higher than 4000 metres, getting to them will be hard and still take quite some time\\n\\nThis is just one of a few examples I could make. Bombers effectiveness is also questionable at best, as most fighters will gun you down at some point during a match. That is more a question of when, not if.\\n\\nThe game also has several single player modes that you could play. Some are free, dynamic campaigns is one them, some are not, the Pacific campaigns, which, from what I've read, they were last updated so long ago that some missions have become unplayable over time, as patches have changed the game and the specifics of each plane.\\nI like dynamic campaigns though: but again, Gaijin doesn't care about them. Some missions are almost impossible to win. They also have a daily limit, which means the rewards get scaled so much after you've completed a couple that you won't be able to get any research points nor silver lions by completing them. Developers want you to play online, not some unfinished single player mode they don't care about.\\n\\nDo yourself a favour and don't play this game. You may get sucked into it, because as I said the foundations are all good and there, but over time you will realize you're mostly getting frustration out of it and you're wasting your time as the economics is completely rigged and want you to spend money on every turn.\\n\\nI almost forgot to mention, after the war in Ukraine the developers decided to remove the chat, making coordination with teammates that much harder. It's been disabled for more than a month now and who knows when it will be back.\\nGo figure\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I started playing this game in 2013, and I've put 2,000+ hours into it. I guess I should give a review. \\n\\nDisclaimer. I am now permanently devoiced in game. When I started in 2013 I was a foulmouthed teenager, and over the course of these 7 years my game chat really didn't change too much. I just began pairing my decreasing opinion of the game with my inappropriate language. I rightfully bare the burden of my permanent devoice.I do not hold anything against the gamemasters or mods for their enforcement of gamechat policy.\\n\\nTo begin, Warthunder had the potential to be the best, most historically accurate and fun arcade style flight simulator/shooter on the market.... because it the only game of its caliber on the market. \\n\\nThe grind until you give up and buy a premium account pay2win currency system is great, but its not for me. I would have rather payed $60 from the start and had complete game. I reached top tier jets years ago, sometime around 2014-2015, and I found that jet combat was the most fun to me, and so I mainly played jets. Gaijin has again and again added a response to counter response of new jets that stomp the previous additions, all in hopes that you will get frustrated enough to buy the newest planes outright. Is it possible to play the game without a premium account or buying planes? Yes. Is it more frustrating without paying to win? Also yes. \\n\\nThe community is nothing but fun. The players all collectively hate our developer overlords for the fat cat money grabbing swindlers they really are.\\n\\nIts 2020. My life has changed, and Warthunder has too. But continuously facing suspiciously biased planes and weapons, while other factions face a significant disadvantage isn't right. You can't make a game focusing on the military marvels of each country, but make the competitive multiplayer a one sided and unbalanced fight without people feeling like they are facing a Russian bias from a Russian developer.\\n\\nEventually a new game will come along where the developers will actively listen to the community, make changes based on feedback and not in the name of pure profit. I will happily shell out my money when that game comes.\\n\\nUnfair balancing, blatant Russian biases and favoritism, and pay2win scheming developers aside, the content of the game is fantastic. There is nothing more satisfying than breaking the sound barrier a treetop level. Facing the skilled tactics equally as good or better pilots, using team tactics - the gameplay itself is wonderful and you should at least try it once. If you look too deep into the game you will eventually start to see the ugly underbelly. So don't look. \\n\\nI've set the cogs in motion to suspend and delete my account. I almost feel like its been an abusive relationship that I couldn't quit. I've deleted the game from my PC probably a dozen times, but I reinstall and get dragged right back in. I like this game, but I am not going to take the abuse from Gaijin anymore. \\n\\nGoodbye Warthunder. Its been one hell of a flight.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I quit this game months ago and it was the best decision I ever made. I am only choosing to review this game now because originally, I did not want it to come from a place of anger. After I quit War Thunder I bought myself a nice flight stick and throttle, downloaded a popular military flight sim and bought a few high-fidelity planes, and learned how to really fly a plane and it’s been a blast! \\n\\nNow that I have moved on and no longer harbor hate for War Thunder, I am going to tell you what can happen if you download this game. Now you might not have money to spend, or maybe you do but you are special, but chances are you are like most of us, you aren't special, you are average, and you work and you play games for fun when you are done working. If that is the case there is a good chance  you will end up like many of the countless players that are caught in this never-ending loop that Gaijin intends to keep you in, grinding every minute or dollar they can out of you until you finally break. If you are lucky this happens early on, if not it happens thousands of hours and dollars later. \\n\\nI  got out just shy of 800 hours and I'm thankful of that.  I am not sure if there are any other reviews like this on steam nor do I care which is why I turned off comments. I believe the truth is a huge percentage of people get burned by these types of games but few are willing to admit it publicly.  Any public discussion about this will have trolls and git gud comments, but the truth is you can't get good at a game that is rigged against you.\\n\\nThose of us with disposable income aren't generally stupid, we know that spending real dollars for pixels  is foolish but we also know what we earn in one hour working versus grinding hundreds of hours for one plane. Those that would rather pretend they are too smart to fall for this model, or that they have grinded every vehicle they own, while they secretly pay, are part of why companies like Gaijin make so much money. \\n\\nWhen you first start playing you are supposed to be blown away by the beauty of the planes and the freedom of flying around. You should be excited that you can point your mouse where you want your plane to go. Wow, the freedom and simplicity of flight! Your first few rounds will be amazing, you'll be killing planes left and right with a crappy WW1 Biplane that can turn on a dime. You probably won’t even realize you are fighting bots but it will be an absolute blast.\\n\\nAs you move up the tiers you will unlock more planes (or other vehicles) and probably get pretty hooked as your hard work is rewarded with exciting new vehicles.\\n\\nWow, a free-to-play game that’s so much fun and all these free vehicles?!!? Amazing right? WRONG. IT IS A TRAP. If you don't read any further just know that you must run, save your time, your money, who knows what else, your job, your relationships? JUST RUN. \\n\\nOK if you are still here let me explain. The game will start as a fun and rewarding experience so that you quickly become hooked. As you progress the grind becomes longer and harder and so does the game. If Gaijin gets its way and you have that kind of personality that many of us do, you will start playing the game every moment you’re not working. The harder it is the more driven you are to rise to the challenge! \\n\\nThe harder you work the higher you rank and your progress slows to the point that you feel compelled to maintain the forward momentum you had earlier so you sign up for a premium account because it will increase your leveling efficiency significantly. Eventually, that slows down too, but now you can’t even imagine not having a premium account.  \\n\\nNow you are in the higher tiers too so you’re getting killed left and right. You start feeling like you need to get good, and skill is the only issue. You think if you just practice enough and git gud you'll start killing everyone. \\n\\nBut no matter how much research or practice or tweaks you make the consistency just isn't there.  You will have some good rounds, sometimes even great rounds, once in a blue moon you might have 5 or 6 awesome matches in a row and you'll get your adrenaline rushes! But it won’t last, inexplicably you'll start to have terrible rounds eventually, no matter what, literally shooting planes and the bullets do nothing. Some will say it's lag even though you have an insanely fast connection, some will say you need to get better, change your gun sites, vehicle settings, or tweak your video settings to low to cheat (especially for tanks) but it's all just a scam. \\n\\nIt doesn't matter how much practice, or time you spend, or money, or what vehicle you use, the game is designed to trap you in an endless miserable loop of grinding, and paying, for small rewards, accepting unfair nerfs on your already unlocked vehicles and getting back to the grind for whatever the flavor of the week vehicle is next.\\n\\nThis loop will frustrate you after whatever combination of time/money you invested and you will think you need to take decisive action to get out of this loop now! Time to double down! You have invested way too much time; you need to start winning consistently, you deserve it! You need a better vehicle and to focus more and work harder to start winning consistently, right?? Time to push harder than ever now, oooohhh your so close to the next plane, you will kick ass consistently when you have that plane. Oh well you have the plane but you need the better engine, or the missiles unlocked, or the airframe upgrades. OH but the grind is SOOO long. Ok your just going to spend some premium currency to speed leveling stuff up because you need a better plane to compete. \\n\\nHmm you know what? These free planes are no good. You need to buy few nice premium vehicles because everyone around you is telling you that you need them, or you’re getting killed by them constantly, that must be the advantage, right? Ill buy this plane for 50 bucks. Oh I need a good tank, oh and a good AA vehicle. Oh I only have these for allied teams I need them for Axis too.\\n\\nJUST STOP.  The truth is that if a vehicle exists that will give you an advantage it will likely be nerfed right after Gaijin has determined enough people have spent money to unlock it whether it be with real money or premium currency. If you can grind it out and it is a great vehicle and you don’t spend money to acquire this vehicle by the time you finally earn it, it will likely be brutally nerfed. I believe the intention is so that the next time a new powerful vehicle arrives you will immediately pay to unlock it just so you can enjoy it before it gets nerfed. \\n\\nIf you start playing despite my warning in this review, there are only 2 ways this is going to end 1. You hate the game but can't stop because you have invested too much time, money, and given up so much in real life that you feel trapped. After all, quitting is admitting you are a jackass and now you must play until either you or the game dies.\\n\\n 2. You do what I did and just walk away and let it go because you were a jackass but that’s ok all you can do is learn from your mistakes or simply repeat them. \\n\\nIf you are caught in this loop, the best advice I can give you is to simply stop logging in and free yourself of the bullshit. \\n\\nIn closing, while I no longer harbor hate for them, I do believe the people that develop and run this game are truly evil.  Unfortunately, they are being rewarded for their greed and their disgusting tactics are encouraged by the very people they take advantage of. \\n\\nWhile I feel free to play has its place when executed without malice, pay to win must end. I think it is time for players with incomes to band together and start refusing to download pay to win games and bring about the much-needed death of an evil business model or the future of gaming will be a grim one.\",\n",

       "  'review': '\\tWar Thunder is an amazing game that revolutionizes many parts of the gaming industry, from small quality of life features such as tow cables to its massive scope from the interwar period to the modern day. However, this creates another problem: War Thunder is a monopoly of a game, and Gaijin, the company that develops the game, treats it as such.\\n\\tWar Thunder is the only game in existence that offers what it does, so if a player wants something that War Thunder gives, they have to go through War Thunder, a game which suffers from dozens of tiny cuts of annoyance that drive old players to leave, and Gaijin makes its money off of constant transplants of new players paying money to get some of the action themselves.\\n\\tGo to any prominent War Thunder YouTuber and they alone will have over a dozen videos detailing individual problems with the game, and how the whole community gives feedback on so many issues only to fall upon deaf ears, or at least ears that don’t seem to care for determining which is good feedback and which is malicious.\\n\\tAnything from the gameplay being unbalanced, to the grind involving over a year of dedicated work, to other small problems, contrasted with the ever-increasing number of late-game and premium vehicles that are increasingly unbalanced in the matchmaking algorithm and much harder to get in the first place, show Gaijin’s lack of genuine care for making the game one worth playing for fun.\\n\\tSince it is a free-to-play game, I don’t want to stop you from playing in the first place, but I beg you, do not pay any money. Support YouTubers and Twitch streamers and other content creators that bring up problems with the game, and see for yourself what War Thunder truly is. Not only for your sake, but for the sake of the whole War Thunder community, which continues to be supported by transplants of new players such as yourself as old players bleed from open wounds that Gaijin does not bandage.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Just to give you an insight of the company that runs this game, Gaijin Entertainment:\\nSome months ago the incredibly unsuccessful E100 tournament took place.\\nPlayers where hyped like ****, A FREAKING E100 IS BEING ADDED\\nWhat people didnt know was that the E100 would only be available to less than 1200 people that won these tournaments, for which you needed to pay to get tickets to play.\\nThe tournament was badly set up and full of hackers (Shhh Gaijin doesnt want us to know there are hackers)\\nOf course thousands of people complained in the forums, including myself.\\nMost of my comments where removed on the context of ''flaming'', some of those comments complained about the removals.\\nShortly after this, they introduced a rule that didnt allow people to post in the forums, unless they had played a certain number of battles prior to posting.\\nAfter receiving a warning for challenging moderation (lol) I got a message from a fellow forum user:\\n''The rule came about shortly after they removed Simulator Battles from the game.  It wasn't to keep the trolls at a minimum, it was to reduce the workload of the moderators after such a poor decision.\\n\\nScarper and Pacifica (two senior mods) are megalomaniacs.   Their egos get in the way of moderation.  Their extra comments on closed threads are often insulting and almost always condescending.  They show the community no respect at all and I believe it is only a symptom of Gaijin policy.  This was evident in the Youtube incident (if you are familiar I won't elaborate, but if you want to know more I'll elucidate)''\\nMore into this:\\nhttp://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/290640-community-relations-or-why-i-have-to-post-in-off-topic-discussions/\\nhttp://ritastatusreport.blogspot.com/2015/07/gaijin-shuts-down-youtubers-channel.html\\nhttp://www.polygon.com/2015/7/30/9068059/rogue-employee-holds-independent-youtube-channel-hostage-war-thunder\\n\\nMods from all around the globe are likely to downvote this, and I doubt this review will ever be viewed by many, but please, stay away from this toxic company while you can.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'You know, I never leave reviews but I can\\'t sit idly by while Gaijin continues to do this. Even though it only says i have 190 hours, I have closer to 4000 spread over a few accounts.\\n\\nA few years back, I would have given this game the biggest thumbs up that could possibly be received. I loved it, I played it day in day out. It was my favourite game and will likely hold that spot in my heart for a long time to come.\\n\\nHowever, recently, Gaijin has been taking some steps towards monetization in what is arguably the most scummy and \"fuck you\" method to the playerbase that I have ever seen in the gaming industry (yes, worse than EA).\\n\\nNot only that, but they seem to not care about the opinions of the player base, but continue to appeal to the wallet warriors only, as seen when they refuse to fix bugs that have been in the game for years, but continue to add copy past planes for 60 USD (see all F-5 variants). The core elements of the game that used to be fun have been ruined. Their continuining desire to add new things to please the wallet warriors has led to planes that have that been in the game since the beginning such as the Me 262 getting its shit kicked in as it has to face jets that are as old compared to it as you to your parents.\\nThey\\'re totally disconnected from the community, and currently, they are trying to implement more shitty features like adding an expiration date to items that we the players have been collecting over the years? Why is this important you may ask? Because the only way to get these is to get them from loot boxes that you have to buy and they\\'re trying to get us to do that :(\\n\\nI really love this game, no other game feels like this one does, but i cannot in good faith recommend it to you at this point in time. Gaijin does not care about you and I don\\'t think you should waste your time and money on them.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"Let's take a closer look at the peculiar case of War Thunder...\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+ Gameplay. War Thunder combines an arcade-like playstyle with an ultra realistic damage model, every player can find something for himself here. You can hop in for a quick and casual match, or you can be all tactical and competitive.\\n\\n+ Variety. Arguably the game's main selling point, the number of historical and modern vehicles is staggering. War Thunder offers hundreds of armored cars, light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, fighters, bombers, attack helicopters, motorboats, battleships and many more... all of that spread across multiple nations with their own quirks and different playstyles.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Matchmaking. Easily the single worst thing about this game. Each vehicle is given an arbitrary Battle Rating value and should only face similarily rated vehicles. At first glance this sounds fair, unfortunately it isn't. The entire BR range is way too compressed, and BR values are based on the averaged global statistics instead of the vehicle's true capabilities. This leads to completely absurd situations, such as late WW2 heavy tanks facing early MBTs with stabilized guns and HEATFS shells - ruining the experience for both.\\n\\n- Economy. Over the years Gaijin has been slowly tightening and rigging the game's economy. All kinds of battle rewards and multipliers have been slowly lowered or removed. The game is now at a point where you can no longer grind towards Rank IV or V without a premium account. You may even no longer be able to play some of your favourite vehicles because the repair costs will ruin you.\\n\\n- Premium vehicles. More and more of them have been added into the game with each subsequent update. Some of those premium vehicles are plain Pay2Win cases while others are abused for their increased rewards and multipliers. This leads to situations where entire BR ranges are dominated by the premium vehicle spam, for example: T-72AV (TURMS-T), KW I C, Ju 288, XP-50 and many more...\\n\\n- Staleness. Despite the variety found in tech trees, almost every other aspect of the game feels incredibly dated and uninspired. Entire game modes have not been touch in years and most new ground maps are poorly designed, half-empty, desert-like battlegrounds with recycled assets.\\n\\nIn conclusion: War Thunder has changed a lot over the years and it's been a downward spiral. It started off as a fun, competitive and semi-historical game which devolved into a weird, grindy and toxic chore. It's problems are now synergizing: bad matchmaking makes the economy issues worse, bad economy forces people to buy premiums, premiums ruin the matchmaking even further. War Thunder could be one of the greatest games out there, instead it choses to be unfun by design.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'i like the mechanics, but i HATE gaijins blatent greed in this game so i can not recommend it unless you are craving for a tank/planes/ship game. iv spent more than 1500 hours (played alot before it got added to steam) i have jets in most countrys, and have high tank br (7.0 up to highest 10.3) in 4 trees. and i freaquntly are the top player on my team, so i feel im confident in this statement. \\n\\nPositives:\\n* Good grapichs\\n* Core mechanics are nice\\n* HUGE tech trees\\n* versatility in what you can play (ships, tanks, helicopters and planes)\\n* Options for difficulty in Arcade, realistic and simulator modes\\n\\nNegatives:\\n* Gaijins absolutly disgusting monetization model \\n* its \"free\" until you get high enough and you wont earn money unless you are a top player.\\n* Gaijin don´t fix broken stuff, only add new vechicles thats op so ppl gotta buy them\\n* Maps are just absolutly shit, there is a a few \"ok\" maps, but the design is terrible and often one side will ahve a CLEAR advantage.\\n* Russian bias (Edited. i feel there is a bias towards the cost of russian tanks, as in they are cheaper to repair as such. Not a russian bias as in all their tanks are OP. commented below abit more regarding this)\\n* The progression without premium is SUCH a grind its insane, (ofc this is to make players pay for premium) \\n* the \"Rewards\" you get in those...battlepacks, are jsut not worth any, wagers/mission is mostly impossible for 99% of players stuff like \"get first AND last kill\" like are you kidding me? and i gotta do that 10 times? \\n* Maps are made for low/mid tier, when you get high tier often ppl can spawn kill straight from their spawn. \\n* Spawnkilling is INSANE!\\n* Playing tanks and only wanna play tanks? get readuy to be destroyed by planes and helicopters thatll bomb you without you having a chance.\\n\\nThere is ofc way more negatives, and if you look at the \"positive\" reviews you´ll also notice the sentence \"love hate relationship\" is pretty common. Its just NOT a good monitasation model, i woulden´t mind paying for stuff, but its so extremly overpriced and they try to FORCE you to get premium. iv played this game since way before it got added on steam, bc i love the mechanics it has. But gaijin is without a doubt a shitty company that somehow miracoulus got a good game. I hope they will ease up on the cost and also make changes to all their maps. But time has proven to me that they simply won´t do it. \\n\\ni do NOT recommend this for anyone who not absolutly need a new game like WoT genre or such. save your time and money for something els.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game itself is great, but the business model it uses is utter garbage.\\n\\nThe game has beautiful graphics, is very well optimized, gameplay is great, the damage system is the most realistic ever made.\\n\\nBut then the devs business model steps in. They want you to spend money on it, of course that\\'s natural, nobody works for free. But you can\\'t purchase the game. You may purchase only a handful of \"special\" vehicles.\\nIn a regular microtransation game business model, you are forced to grind to have items that you could have by paying extra money. If this is included in a game you already paid, many consider this itself a bad business model that does not respect the player\\'s time and is bad game design. If it\\'s included in a F2P game and the amount of money required to purchase all times by far exceeds the quality of the game and the market\\'s average price, then it\\'s considered pay to win. \\n\\nAnd what Gaijin Entertainment does? They DOUBLE IT DOWN, they make you pay so you can have the \"privilege\" of GRINDING LESS. But you still have to grind in one way or other. And it\\'s no small amount of grind either. See the slug on their company\\'s logo? That\\'s an excellent allegory to the slugish progress you make in this game. After some point of the game, you are not allowed to have bad luck. If you kill less than two or three enemies in a match, you will lose money. If you kill 5 or 6 enemies AND your team wins the game, you MAY gain about 2% or 3% of the money you need to purchase the next vehicle.\\n\\nHere is my current situation for example: I have a Tiger I tank. Every time my Tiger gets destroyed, I lose nearly 2500 to 3000 silver lions to repair it. Killing an enemy gives me around 1000 to 1200 silver lions, and you get about 3000 lions bonus if your brain dead teammates can actually help you to win the match. So I am forced to have a K/D ratio of 3.0 on every game so I can DREAM about buying my desired $170,000 Panther tank someday. After spending about 20 hours this weekend playing this game, keeping a positive K/D on most games I made about 80k lions. In two days of heavily grinding I got barely HALF of what I need to get ONE tank. And I am not even in the MIDDLE of the game, while endgame tanks costs over one million lions, so I can only expect things to get worse unless I start paying HUNDREDS of dollars to get premium currency that will still not grant me access to these vehicles in any way, and will just make things maybe SLIGHTLY easier. Even if killing moer advanced tanks will give me more money, repairing my more advanced tanks will also cost more moneys, which makes the game`s pace not change. So if I ever dream of unlocking all tanks so someday I can play with the Leopard II, I still need to sink 400 hours into this game, or pay the devs about 100 dollars of Premium currency to reduce my grind to \"just\" 200. And that\\'s just one tank segment of one faction.To get access to all tanks in the game it would cost THOUSANDS of dollars plus THOUSANDS of grind hours, or if I wanted to remain not paying anything, maybe 20k hours? Yeah, imagine thinking it\\'s okay to spend more time grinding in a game than you need to get a college degree.\\n\\n\\nLosing is part of every game, but this game punishes you by wasting your time and potentially taking away your money if you were iressponsible enough to spend it on this crap. Everytime I get a lucky kill by accidentaly flanking somebody I feel bad because I probably made somebody\\'s day worse by pushing their progress back and I didn\\'t even feel accomplished.\\nThe entire game is designed around mining your earnings and make you spend money. You need to buy shltty vehicles you don\\'t want to advance to the next tier. You need to purchase shltty vehicle modifications you don\\'t need to have access to the ones you want. For every new vehicle you buy, you need to spend money so you can INVENT FIRE STINGUISHERS AGAIN. Everything. Everytime. Everywhere, you need to spend your money. You are not even entitled to choose the maps you want to play. You can choose ONE map out of the map rotation IF you accept to pay for their shltty subscription service. And there you go. Playing on a map you hate. A map deliberately poorly designed. You take a wrong turn. Your tank falls into a ditch, and guess what? GUESS WHAT? You must spend money to repair it.\\nLike, you have a Panzer IV Ausf. G, then you \"want\" to go to the Panzer IV Ausf H  (like, even if you don\\'t want you have no choice, you are forced to researcha and purchase every useless vehicle in the tecthree to unlock new ones) Ausf. G you must research EVERYTHING again, despite the  Ausf. H being literally just the  Ausf. G with some useless armor plate skirts added.\\n\\nAh, and you must pay for the AMMO you use. That\\'s serious.\\nI wonder how long it will take until they decide to charge us for the FUEL of the tanks. Or to pay wages to the tank crews. Like, they can use the excuse that they are trying to make the game more \"realistic\", and make you need to pay wages for the crews, pay for their dental plan, for their children\\'s colleges. \" Wellcome back, your crewmember Hans has suffered a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. 40k lions have been taken from your account to pay for his medical expenses\".\\n\\nI would gladly pay $60 to play this game with at least all WW2 tanks.\\nBut all their offers are laughable. They are right now charging 30 dollars for a shitty T-34 tank and people are buying it. Yes, you heard right. A SINGLE vehicle that is just a slight upgrade of an existing free version.\\n\\nAnd yes, there is also the famous Russian bias. The devs are russians, and they are shamessly nationalistic and not afraid of trying to make their nation look the best. And how they do this in a game which takes pride of it\\'s extremely realistic vehicle stats? If they lie about the vehicle specs people will just check them in Wikipedia to call them out. What they do? Simple! Match them in anachronic fights. The IS-2 only saw action in 1944, mostly fighting against Tiger II tanks and Jagdpanzers. So you make it show up early to fight 1942 Tiger I, Panzer IVs, and Shermans instead. The PT-76 was one of the most useless tanks of the Cold War? A light tank that could barely hold itself against infantry? Well then just make it show up TEN YEARS earlier to fight early WW2 tanks. But yet it all backfired. In this poor attempt to overcompensate their insecurity and irrational patriotism, the devs just accidentaly showed how bad Soviet armor was, by proving that is completely possible for a SHERMAN to kill Cold-War Soviet tanks. Hilarious.\\nI don\\'t know about the Air Battles mode (I refuse to touch that mode with a ten foot pole. I\\'m h ere only for the tanks). But I heard from friends that Soviet planes are capable of ridiculously unrealistic feats.\\n\\nOn this state, I would refuse to spend 10 cents on this game. I just want to get a nice mug of black cofee in a rainy day, sit back and relax, drive my Tiger across the green hills while I listen to some classical music and calmly try to spot enemies with my bynoculars, and this is currently not possible with all the grinding pressure the game currently has.  I will come back again in a few years, maybe people will start to get tired of this game. Now there are no more new tanks to add. I don`t think they will be adding more modern aircraft because I doubt a game that prides itself of it`s realism would want to make F-15s and MiG-31s dogfight. (A F-4 vs. MiG-21 is the most modern dogfight you can get. More modern aerial warfare than that is basically just dots beeping in the radar and getting shot across the continent). Hopefully this game\\'s development cycle will end soon, people will start to leave due the lack of new content, and the devs may reduce these ridiculous grinding requirements to attract people back. Until then, I would not recommend anybody to waste their time with this grindfest. Go play games that respect your time.',\n",

Gaijin is one of the most greediest, inept, and downright scummy developers I\\'ve had the unfortunate fate to stumble upon.\\n\\nGripe #1: The Grind\\nThis game takes months without spending real money to get the next vehicle you want once you reach Tier III. I remember being super excited to get to research my Tiger I H1 (long before the E ever came out) and it taking me close to 2 months of grinding just to get enough research to unlock it. The Tiger 1 H1 at this point is only a mid-tier vehicle. Imagine the grind once you get to modern vehicles. I\\'m currently researching the F-104A, this jet takes 390,000 research points, in a good game where you don\\'t immediately get thrashed (very common see Gripe #3 for more details) you earn about 1500 research points. A typical game lasts about 20 minutes. At this rate it would take you 260 good games or 86 hours of continuously sweat level gaming to unlock this jet without real money. That is close to half a week of no sleep, no family, and no job to unlock this jet and this isn\\'t even taking into account Gripe #3.\\n\\nGripe #2: The Economy\\nAnother way Gaijin entices you to spend real money is through the economy of the game. In this game, you have a multitude of purchases you have to make to progress and do good. These purchases are facilitated by the in-game currency you earn through play. There are many upgrades that you purchase in this way for your vehicles that bring you onto a level playing field because most people will have the upgrades and will put you at a severe disadvantage. For instance, just unlock that new shiny tank that you\\'ve been grinding for weeks? Well now you need to get the upgrades for it. One of the upgrades is a fire extinguisher. Take a shell to the fuel tank and it set your tank on fire? You need the fire extinguisher. It is one of the most crucial upgrades you will need. Bomber drops a bomb on your tank in spawn and takes out your engine? Guess you\\'ll be sitting in spawn for the whole time you want to use that tank or bail out early and pay full repair cost. Oh what\\'s repair cost? Only the most infuriating aspect of the economy. Its pretty simple, your vehicle blow up? You pay in-game currency to repair it so you can use it again. You want to know how repair costs are determined? Oh funny you should ask. They have a base cost that is then raised based on the VERY upgrades you need to do good. How is base cost determined? Who knows, its completely arbitrary. Have a tank that Gaijin thinks is too good for the tanks it faces? Lets just up the repair cost on that so you lose money every time you want to use the awesome tank you spent weeks grinding. Yes, once you get to higher tier (4+) more often than not you will be losing in-game currency instead of earning more like you did in the previous tiers. All of this together is meant to force you to buy premium or buy the currency outright. This wouldn\\'t be so bad if the prices weren\\'t so sky high ridiculous. Want premium for the month that will cut your grind in half? Cough up $10 a month. Don\\'t have any enough in-game currency to buy that F-104A? That will be $20 dollars to just BUY the jet. You still have to pay to select a crew for the jet and even more to for the upgrades on the jet that should come standard. You\\'re looking at about $35 to get just 1 jet airworthy.\\n\\nGripe #3: The Time Machine/Veteran Vehicle? Mo Problems\\nThis gripe could actually be two gripes but they are so closely related I\\'ll bunch them together. So to start with vehicles have arbitrary battle rating that Gaijin gives each vehicle so that they can matchmake their games and attempt to have balanced games. The only problem is that these battle ratings are often historically inaccurate and would never take place in the real world. Battle ratings exist to punish good vehicle designs. Here\\'s an example, remember my Tiger I H1 from above? It has a battle rating of 5.3. The way matchmaking works is this tank can be placed against any other vehicle within 1 full point of it. Now \"Wait\" you say \"Doesn\\'t that mean you have the opportunity to stomp lesser tanks?\" Yes that is a possibility but most of the time that won\\'t happen the way the game actually carries out matchmaking is that it will \"uptier\" you. What I mean by this is say you were in that Tiger I H1 90% of the time you are going to be placed in the higher 6.3 battle rating games. Now beings that you are in a German tank, you\\'re going to primarily see Soviet and American vehicles pitted against you. So what are some vehicles that exist at the same battle rating as your Tiger from these other countries? First one that comes to mind is the PT-76B. The PT-76B is a 1950s era Soviet APC/ARV. A 1950s vehicle going up against a vehicle that was design a whole decade prior. This is extremely broken in play as the PT-76B has access to more modern munitions that will slice through your Tiger like butter and has better acceleration due to its low weight. Absolutely broken. For the Americans you have a slew of Shermans with 76mm high velocity guns. Never mind the fact that most Shermans at this point still had 75mm guns that shot slow rounds. We\\'re sending your Tiger against vehicles that were meant to contend with your big brothers the King Tiger and Panther. Lets move the examples over to my other grind, American planes. I have a F-86F-25 Sabre. I regularly encounter AV-8 Harriers. A jet that was produced for Korea is going against a 1970s jet that is still in service today. You will get eaten alive by the air-to-air missiles that other jets have that your Sabre does not because they either weren\\'t invented yet or Gaijin added your version of the Sabre in before they embraced modern vehicles and their modern armaments. That\\'s right, I can go find Sabres that were added more recently in other countries\\' tech trees that have air-to-air missiles but the COUNTRY THAT DESIGNED THE JET AND THE MISSILES THE OTHER JETS HAVE does not have a single Sabre with missiles. This illustrates that Gaijin does not care about making veteran players happy. They only care about releasing the next vehicle to bring in more cash so they can line their pockets.\\n\\nIn summary, do not download this game, do not give this scummy company your hard earned greenbacks, and most certainly do not think they actually care about your criticism. These issues have persisted in the game for years and they have not lifted a finger to correct them. There are many more issues I could of discussed but these are the three that come to the top of my mind that infuriate me the most about this game. You could google \"gaijin.net agent\" or \"war thunder shill\" to get a quick glance at a couple other issues.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This. Game. Will. Break you.\\nI only have 90 hours on the Steam version of WT, but I have been playing this game since before Ground Forces came out (before tanks were added, and the game only had planes). Back then, it was pretty good. But as time went on, Gaijin decided to enter a competition with EA for Most Scummy Developers...and won. The grinding is unbelievable; you can forget about driving any of the cool tanks you recognize or flying any of the famous planes. If you absolutely MUST have the cool vehicles, then I hope you either have a lot of disposable income, or you\\'re willing to sacrifice a whole year of your life playing this game.\\n\\nIf you\\'re like me, you\\'ll start out patiently grinding, but eventually, inevitably, this game will break you. They say certain games are designed to be literally addictive- this is one of those games. You will suddenly find yourself willing to spend money you don\\'t even have in order to buy your way to the next level of aircraft, or pay just to have that new tank you unlocked \"upgraded\" so it becomes actually useful. You will become tempted to spend \"just another\" 5 bucks to make your pilot an ace, or to make your tank crew well-trained. You will be tantalized with pretty war machines to crack open your wallet once more, just so you can buy a \"premium\" vehicle that Gaijin will end up nerfing or even deleting a couple months later.\\n\\nThe entire game is designed to tease you and make you give up your money. There are shiny, premium vehicles galore. You can pay premium currency to skip past boring vehicles. After unlocking a new vehicle, it will barely be able to move or maneuver and will even be unable to repair broken parts...but you can make all those problems go away with another $5. Tired of boring one-tone paint for your tank? Buy a snazzy new camouflage. Have you finally reached the cool, high-level vehicles? Oh no, if they die in battle it costs you more money just to repair them than you make in that battle. Better spend another few bucks. Want to make your vehicle able to be used more than once per battle? Give Gaijin some money and you can do that. Are you tired of only being able to have two decals on your vehicle? Money can fix that! Do you just want one badass plane or tank to use forever, and you don\\'t care about any other vehicles? You can buy most high-level vehicles for $40 or more.\\n\\nThe jokes and memes are true, this game makes EA games look generous. Don\\'t play it. Even if you are the most pure-hearted, anti-microtransaction player who has locked all their money in an underground vault, don\\'t play it. The game is thoroughly engineered at every level so that you have to spend money to make the game fun enough to keep playing.\\nI barely went into detail. If you want to know the full pain, read some of the other long reviews.',\n",

Unique, engaging gameplay, fresh concept, good balance of grind and microtransactions. Friendly developers loving their game and not at all greedy. Paving the way of new generation in MMO games.\\nI cant exactly put my finger on the exact moment when the game turned to worse. Maybe it was introduction of Abrams, maybe it was much earlier. No matter. \\nAs it stands now its aggresively monetized shitfest with developers that dont play their own game, dont communicate with playerbase and terrible moderators that filter out criticism causing more harm. Every patch logical and understandable changes are mixed with bad not well thought features that progressively make whole game worse and worse.\\n\\nGame is still solid in certain aspects and playing certain vehicles is fun. But on the whole i wouldnt recommend it to anybody.\\n\\nToo much focus was laid on monetization and somwhere in this pursuit of dollars terrible thing happened - game has lost its charm and became a chore to play. It was a long ride War Thunder. I will keep good memories.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Update:\\nSince posting my below review it should be noted:\\n[list]\\n    [*]None of the below mentioned issues have been fixed, or even remotely addressed. The developers are fundamentally and completely deaf to any and all community feedback and/or taking basic quality assurance measures in maintaining the game.\\n    [*]Multiple new, game breaking issues have been introduced, and game balance continues to deteriorate. Additional pay to win premium vehicles have been introduced, as well as extremely unfair ingame events based around squeezing money out of players through the game\\'s online marketplace,\\n    [*]The game continues to be based around a single core design concept: strongarm players into paying exorbitant amounts of money through intentionally damaging the quality of the core gameplay loop and dangling solutions in front of the player that must be repeatedly paid for.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThe game is, has been, and will remain utterly terrible.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nAs a disclaimer, I exclusively play this game for the ground forces mode, so won\\'t be addressing the air combat or naval modes, though in general many of my larger points carry over in some way.\\n\\nFirst off, what this game does well:\\n[list]\\n    [*]The modeling of the vehicles is amazing. Both in terms of detail and (mostly) in terms of handling, the models and effects for each vehicle make for a truly beautiful experience, especially when compared with other competitors in the armored combat game genre.\\n    [*]The actual basic gameplay mechanics of the ground combat are excellent. The realistic way in which vehicle damage and dynamics are modeled gives the game a weighty feel that captures the subject matter with enjoyable heft. Driving a tank in War Thunder feels much more fundamentally appealing than in other competing games such as World of Tanks.\\nThe rush of successfully scoring a kill in armored combat is awesome, and has kept me coming back for more despite the game\\'s many glaring flaws.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWith that out of the way, here are some of the reasons I do not recommend anyone pick up this game, even at the entry price of free:\\n[list]\\n    [*]The ingame economy and progression system is an exploitative, broken, and endlessly aggravating mess that has been terrible since the game first launched and has received only the tiniest of improvements over the many years it has been in active development. The rate of gain for \\'Research Points\\', the experience points used to unlock new vehicles, and \\'Silver Lions\\', the currency actually used to buy things, are both horrifically low, with the express goal of getting you to purchase \\'Golden Eagles\\', the game\\'s shiny play money that costs real money and can be used to effortlessly breeze your way forward so long as you\\'re willing to drop hundreds if not thousands of dollars (US, or your regional conversion) into the game.\\nRewards for gameplay are terribly low in the first place, but only get worse when you realize that [i]the game makes you pay to repair your vehicles and buy more ammunition after each battle[/i]. That\\'s right, if your vehicle is damaged or destroyed in a match, you have to pay Silver Lions to repair it. Even worse, each vehicle has unlockable ammo types, which are almost always much better than the vehicle\\'s free stock ammunition, each round of which will cost you more Silver Lions to purchase. This gets especially bad with high tier vehicles, the constant hype machines that the game uses to lure people in, resulting in many matches where you will lose significant sums of money if you miss a shot or have your vehicle damaged or destroyed. Given that the whole point of the game is to fight other players using, you know, tanks with guns on them, you will generally end close to 50% of your games looking at being charged for your insolence in thinking you can actually play the vehicles you spent hundreds of hours grinding to use.\\nAnd the vehicle grind? If you want to have the privilege of driving that shiny M1A1 or T-80u you had better be prepared to play every day for several years to top even one nation\\'s tech tree, which will probably be soured in the end because of the game constantly introducing unbalanced new units instead of fixing any of the glaring issues with the economy and progression system.\\n    [*]The balance. There is no balance. Vehicles are thrown with minimal concern across the Battle Rating (a number used to quantify a vehicle\\'s power and match it with similar vehicles) field, constantly leaving you fighting much more powerful units as you painfully claw your way up the tech tree, only to finally reach top tier and...\\nThere is also zero balance at top tier. New units are introduced constantly to keep the game rolling on announcement hype, with little concern for their performance or the meta they will create. The only pitiful excuse for balance the developers do implement is in increasing the costs for repairs and ammunition for over-performing vehicles, which does nothing but ensure that players who pay real money for in-game currency (did I mention you can just straight up buy Silver Lions with Golden Eagles? No? Yeah.) have a quantitative advantage in being able to operate overpowered units in every match, while those who refuse to invest their life savings into the game are left out in the cold, unable to pay the repair costs on vehicles they spent hundreds of hours earning.\\nIt gets even better when you introduce aircraft into the mix, because all modes for ground vehicles are actually \"Mixed Battles\", which let aircraft and helicopters join in on the fun. What I mean by \\'join in on the fun\\' is that in most matches where you play a tank you will end up being killed by a plane dropping a bomb on you rather than being destroyed by another tank. This only gets worse in top tier matches, where helicopters can hover at extreme range from the battlefield and one-shot-kill tanks using anti-tank guided missiles, which they get a large number of, meaning that you have to spend half your time trying to enjoy playing a ground vehicle constantly looking out for and dodging air vehicles. The developers\\' fix for this? Introduce overpowered anti-aircraft ground units, which are of course top-tier vehicles that you are required to grind for.\\nThis is all made much, much worse by the design of the maps that you do your actual fighting on, most of which look very nice, but are some of the worst I have ever seen in terms of game design. Sight lines are nonsensical and cover is scattered around seemingly at random, with many maps allowing enemy vehicles to find ways to shoot into one team\\'s spawn locations from the mid point of the map, leaving players respawning late in the game to be instantly annihilated. And added bonus is that there\\'s also nothing to prevent aircraft from camping players leaving their spawns, meaning that you might not even get the chance to see your enemy before a bomb or missile exterminates you 10 meters from your spawn point.\\n    [*]The bugs. There have been reasonable improvements in the game over time in the bug department, but there still remain many annoying issues that will swoop in to disrupt your experience. The game\\'s physics engine is a common culprit, ensuring your tank is launched into the air by a rock or killed by an enemy shell that ricochets through the Nth dimension to somehow wipe out your vehicle. It\\'s less of a pain point than the above points, but it does happen, and it will ruin your day.\\n[/list]\\n\\nAll in all War Thunder offers a unique and compelling gameplay experience that I do not recommend anyone check out, because it serves only as a lure for a terribly unfair monetization scheme backed up by countless glaring issues in basic game design that will leave you  gnashing your teeth and swearing profusely far more often than delivering the tantalizing enjoyment that the game might otherwise deliver.\\n\\nIt\\'s not worth your time, and it\\'s definitely not worth your money.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Update after 3 years: \"The game got worse, now on top of the already existing unparalleled anti-consumer practices, they added battle passes and drove the prices in the player market to extremes. The game requires now ALL your free time, or a large part of your wallet. Even in that case, you will never be able to get all the vehicles, so if you have a completionist urge and are not interested in spending 2000$ for a vehicle, stay away.\"\\n\\nOriginal Review\\nI am playing War Thunder since the beta, when unlocking planes was actually enjoyable and there were no \"stock\" useless vehicles. Many \"new\" simpleminded fans that defend Gaijin don\\'t know that this game didn\\'t have a research system back then, while now it even has the same spotting mechanics of World of Tanks. Although they\\'re more refined, like pretty much every aspect of the game. This one can be considered as a semi-sim with also an arcade mode.\\n\\n[i]I own a Premium Account since release and most premium vehicles. Please read it trough the end, because this review is not about the quality of its gameplay, it goes beyond that. I hope Gaijin will notice the reviews and understand why the population has dropped trough the years, with an average of 80-100k players online before the 1.37 (when there was no research system), to an average of 30-40k (with tanks too). Triple the content, less than half population.[/i]\\n\\nAfter all the miscommunications (bugs being fixed a year after the community notified it, disliked events, introduction of loot boxes to get old-limited-events vehicles and more) and the continuous mocking and hostility of the moderator [b]Stona[/b] towards members of the community, even when they only ask for changes to the balancement or japanese prototype tanks (they have a poor tree and are unplayable), I thought that I had to write a new review for the game.\\n\\nWhat can I say, the War Thunder has gone a long way since then. New nations, an entire new tank-based game (Ground Forces) and the announcement of the both ships and helicopters in the near future. It\\'s sad to see the player base dropping costantly every year, since the 100k+ that were when we had only planes, to 20-30k.\\nUnfortunately, while the content has slowly got better, the progression has not. I also made the horrible choice to grind Japan. While the first two tiers are enjoyable by free2players too, the higher we go on the research tree, the worst it get, to a point where dying may even give you a negative amount of money. To me, with a premium account and 50€ premium tanks with extra rewards, it may not be a problem, but it is to anyone else. The grinding for research points gets tedious since mid-game for tanks and late-game for planes, and you have to consider also the amount of money needed to do everything: \\nDo you want to buy an unlocked vehicle? Buy it. Do you want to equip it to a crew? Pay (even 290k for top tiers). Do you want to shoot? Buy the ammo, Is it broken? Buy the repair service. What about events? Pay for the ticket.\\nSure, it is immersive to pay for some features, but all of this balance create a lot of issues to other players. \\n\\nAnd what about the modifications? When you research and buy a vehicle, it doesn\\'t come at his max potential. It\\'s a stock vehicle, with basic ammo, a worst engine and whatsoever. If you\\'re interested in planes you should be good, your plane will be usually worse than the others but you\\'ll be able to play and slowly spade it (i.e. max it). Oh you\\'re interested in tanks?\\n\\nThen [b] welcome to fucking hell.[/b]\\n\\nTo make a tank playable you usually need at least two upgrades: Parts and FPE. Parts is an upgrade that let you repair your vehicle, FPE is an extinguisher to put off the fire. To get the FPE you first need to unlock another upgrade, so a total of 3 upgrades are necessary. MANY tanks are also useless at their battle rating (another issue which I\\'ll describe later) and to make them playable you\\'ll need advanced ammo, which may request up to 4-5 upgrades first.\\n\\n[i]\"Hey but I just unlocked the parts with one match\"[/i]\\n\\nHeh, sure it\\'s good to play at Rank I-II, when you only 2-5k research points each. At Rank V-VI it becomes 16-24k, even 40k in some cases.\\n\\nImagine having to grind 16k (Average f2p gets 2-3k I think, when it actually get kills. A premium player with a premium vehicle usually get 10k) without penetrating ammo, without being able to repair as soon as something hit you and with the survivability of a dodo. What if I matchmake your tank to an higher battle rating? Owww damn, your tank exploded right away, it was expectable indeed. Pay me 8k please to repair it.\\n\\nRepeat that for every new vehicle you\\'ll unlock. Welcome to Ground Forces. Fortunately you can pay to buy a Rank IV/V premium vehicle and enjoy the bonus rewards and a fully spaded tank. 49,99€ over your sanity. And don\\'t forget to buy the experience for your crew or they will suck. Always, even after 200hr you will not have enough experience to max a single crew and you\\'ll pay real money to do that.\\n\\nLast, about that battle rating I mentioned: it basically represent the strenght of a tank on a fictional \"tier list\".  It influence the matchmaking. Whenever you queue the game uses your highest rated vehicle in your formation and searches for other players with the same battle rating OR a fluctuation of +1/-1. If you use a 6.7 tank, you may end up with other tanks from 5.7 to 7.7.\\nObviously the chance you will end up in a 7.7 match are 80% and guess what, most tanks will become extremely hard to play and - if lacking FPE/Parts/ammo - the may become completely useless.\\n\\nMix all of that and do your math. It\\'s a well-made game, fun, varied and with both arcade and simulative modes, but this is really infuriating and has to stop. Get back on track.\\n\\n\\nGaijin will never read this, but by making these two small changes they would make it surely more fun and bring back the community. The reduced matchmaking would be compensated by bigger numbers. I\\'d also remove the \"Parts\" from the game, but I guess that\\'s too much to ask to Gaijin.\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]+50% rewards to all vehicles (they use visible % under every vehicle to balance the rewards)\\n    [*]Reduce the matchmaking from +1/-1 to +0.7/-0.7.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThere are more than 1000 vehicles right now, at least 3 more than when it started. It\\'s time to reduce the grinding to these new standards. Even more if we include the upcoming ships, the italian army and the mentioned \"two new nations in the next years\". How is a new player supposed to reach rank III/IV in three different modes and multiple nations?\\nMost new players stop after third/fourth rank of a single nation. I am sure that letting them focus on more nations wouldn\\'t reduce the income, they will probably end up buying more premium vehicles.',\n",

       "  'review': 'DON\\'T TOUCH THIS. War Thunder is the most addictive, yet toxic game i haver ever played. Only reason anyone plays this is because this is because there is no other game like it. Ofcourse there is world of planes, tanks, ships. But none of them have the \"realism\" theme that WT has. You play and get hooked with how good the planes look and it\\'s pretty easy in the start with you being able to get a new vehicle every 10,20,30 matches and upgrades every 2nd match. But then you get to 4.0 and then the grind hits, you need to play for hours every day just to make any progress or keep up with one tech tree not mentioning 1 or 2. Which is when people just pay for premium accounts, and new vehicles. I mean we get it, you have to put food on the table, but This. This is just greed, if you want to ever see jets you\\'re going to have to pay, if you want to finish a single tech tree without paying? \"Play\" for 6-8 hours every day for years and you might get to cold war era tech. Eventualy you get bored and leave, but then find nothing else like WT and eventually come crawling back to this psycho abusive bitch girlfriend of a game. IF there was ever a single company that would announce a game with the same concept, and didn\\'t abuse it\\'s playerbase and listend to them even for one time, it would take about 2 weeks for everyone to forget this game',\n",

       "  'review': \"*3200 hours* As you can see I have devoted way to much time into this game and I will likely continue because I feel that I have already invested too much to just drop this game. The biggest issue with this game is the devs, or atleast their corporate. (Now don't think i'm just some commie that doesn't like capitalism). Gaijin constantly says that they wont do this or wont do that but they turn right around and use some loop hole to claim that they didn't break their promise. This is most visible with the KA-50 helicopter. They claimed they would never add top tier premiums then about a year later added the KA-50, which is a helicopter that is put one rank below top rank and .3 BR lower than top tier. It sits behind a $50 price wall. They do shet like this all the time. The community gets mad at them and Gaijin just goes look at this new thing for you to spend hours of your free time to get and the community shuts up and licks it all up and acts like nothing happened till something else happens. Gaijin is inconsistent with what they say when it comes to balance. They have just left the game mode that started this thing on the back burner for years. And with all the issues this game has they just add more crap and wont fix their game. The community has been asking for a much needed BR decompression but Gaijin refuses and continues to make their game worse by adding more and more. this game could be so much better if Gaijin would listen to the player base and try to make things better rather than pat their bottom line constantly, so you have been warned play this game at the risk to your own sanity. Clearly mine left long ago.\\n\\n*5328 hours* Please help meeeeee just end it now\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I genuinely once believed in Gaijin to be a reasonable company that would put aside moronic and neanderthalic greed in place for a game that could bring in a larger audience and expose to a larger audience the appeal to being an armchair weapon and vehicle historian. However ever since 2012 my hours used in this game have only proven me wrong as time has gone on, I\\'ve unlocked almost every vehicle, every achievement, and yet everytime I play this game I feel like a battered house wife in an abusive relationship with a husband who sells his wife just to make his own business gain more profit. As such I always have strong feelings for when a change is implemented and when the game is \"rebalanced\" for the sake of \"fun\". The game isn\\'t fun, the game is in fact a chore to play. You genuinely have a better chance to get a part time job and just buy a T-72 irl, that\\'s how much the grind is in this game. By the time you would have spent 5 years irl saving up money to buy a soviet armored car, you would have gotten the same vehicle in this god forsaken game. The game always remains with potential to become far grander in scale and if anything far more entertaining in execution. However, gaijin as a company is no worse in greed than EA. EA by comparison, has far more respect from me than Gaijin simply due to their transparency to their choices and their greed, I at the very least am given an explanation as of to why such changes are applied to an EA game, however with Gaijin it\\'s just radio silence no matter the change. One day you will have a new vehicle working just fine, and the next patch the vehicle is upside down and flying into the sky just like the 1.64 patch with the flying upside down churchills... I genuinely believe you have a better chance working and slaving away in a part time job at amazon than you would spending the same amount of time in this game to get a high tier vehicle. As such, in conclusion, save your time and money, just play something else',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have a hard time recommending this game right now, and I will explain why....\\n\\nAt least here on steam, I don’t have to worry about being bullied by Gaijin for writing a critical review. I really want to like this game. Unlike a lot of kiddies who post on the forums, I am much older. I am a gamer from the 80's, growing up on simulators from the 80's and 90's like F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Interceptor, Birds of Prey, Their Finest Hour, Knights of the Sky, etc. These were on the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, etc. \\n\\nIf you are younger and unfamiliar with these titles, look them up. It will give you an idea of how long I have been around flying the cyber skies and coming from an experienced point of view.  I guess that's why I am amused when kids try to lecture players who have been flying sims for decades before they were even on the earth. So, for the younger among us, you can learn something from your elders. \\nWarthunder is very frustrating, it has the potential to be a really good game, but instead is held back by Russian nationalism and left over cold war era mentalities. \\n\\nI have spent many hours and money on this game, I have supported them financially and really have given them time to fix their problems, unfortunately they continue to run with a delusional narrative. \\n\\nOften you will hear people claim there is a Russian bias to the game. Well, to be blunt, yes, it true. The only people who argue otherwise always prove to be A) of Russian decent themselves and take it personally, B) Are apologists for Gaijin and tote the typical fan boy nonsense, or C) They use Russian tanks or planes and are comfortable in their over powered vehicles, afraid they will be taken away. \\n\\nRecently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…\\n\\nSo what does this mean exactly?....Basically he is saying they’re going to fudge the facts for the sake of Russian ego?\\nI take issue with Warthunder because Gaijin continues to claim they strive for “historical accuracy” however they have shown no real attempt to make that so. \\n\\nThey make disparaging comments about German WWII tanks, planes and tech of the era. They claim their hardware was inferior to Soviet hardware, and all the publications that say otherwise is pure “western propaganda”.\\nAny objective student of WWII history knows the Germans were known for having very advanced superior equipment. There is a reason Both the U.S. and the Soviets were grabbing up as many German scientist and tech as they could at the end of the war. \\n\\nThe Planes and Tanks\\n\\nWarthunder has dishonestly taken Russian planes that were underperforming or produced in low numbers, and exaggerated their abilities. They also have a whole SEPARATE development team for the Russian planes vs the rest of the planes. What does that tell you? \\n\\nThe P-38 lightning doesn’t perform anything like its real counterpart, I thought, “man, this plane flies like crap”, so I did some research. I found out that Gaijin gave the P-38 a heavy bomber/fighter flight model, they assigned the A-20 flight model to the P-38 lighting! But wait, what did they do with Russian planes that had unfinished flight models? They were simply void of any drag penalties. Instead, they left out variables on the planes, causing them to perform UFO like Arial maneuvers. \\n\\nThe bombers are all nerfed with bomb load capacity, however without any explanation, the Russian Yer is conveniently left without the same changes, and is allowed a higher capacity. \\n\\nALL U.S. Navy aircraft are atrocious. They don’t perform near to their real models. The  F-4U Corsair, which was nick named “whispering death” by the Japanese can’t be flown more than two minutes without it beginning to overheat. \\n\\nThe P-63, which was not a very good plane in general, is given super capabilities. Gee…is that because the Russians used this plane in the war from Lend Lease? Well, what does this tell you? If you look up the P-63 for the Americans, and the P-63 for the Russians, WOW!....the P-63 for the Russians is magically superior in performance despite being an export of the same plane. \\n\\nThe bombers?....They use to perform ok. Now their destroyed with a massive nurf where a couple of shots from a machine gun will explode a B-29! Its truly ridiculous. \\n\\nWanting to see for myself, I began to fly Russian planes. Sure enough, the ease in which I could fly around and destroy the enemy with ease was absurd. I shook my head in disgust and quit right there. I later came back and tried again, yet the same thing is happening in tanks as well. You have T-34’s driving around pawning Tigers for crying out loud. \\nThere is so much examples of this, we could be here all day. This is only further supported by their absurd forum posts where they talk about Soviet tech being superior to all other nations in WWII. It really is amazing how strong their bias truly is. \\n\\nThen, Gaijiin behaves like a bunch of KGB thugs. If ANYONE brings up anything deemed slightly critical on their forums, ALL dissent is immediately locked, silenced and deleted. Threads are deleted or locked, and people get banned, simply for holding an opinion they don’t like. Google Gajiin extorion scandal\\n\\nThat behavior alone truly is disgusting. Here is a real kicker though….look at Gaijiin rules for the games. They state that “historical characters who violated human rights are not permitted to be mentioned”. \\n\\nHmm…so History they don’t approve of is out, talking about history is out….but here is the best part. Hitler is a no no…can’t talk about him. But wait!......Stalin, a monster who arguably was just as bad if not worse than Hitler, killing 20 million or more of his own people, he is perfectly fine! In fact, Warthunder will even let you put the words “For Stalin” in Russian on the side of your tank or plane! YAY for double standards! \\n\\nTeam Work?.....foget about it! You have kids flying around ramming, or...while you are working on a plane, they will show no dicipline or respect at all. Rather then hold off your wiing, they will try to fly in front of you while your shooting, and take your kill! Now, 3 things happen here. A} They fly infront of your fire and get hit, then you get penalized for team damge. They also will idiotically accuse you of twam killing. B) they dont get hit by your fire, but cause you to have to break off to avoid a collsion and screw up your kill. Or C) they collide into you, and then accuse you of ramming them. \\n\\nThere is no mutual respect for team work in this game. It would help if they would implement coms for the whole team, and allow more then 4 players in a squad. Another nice feature would be the ability to fly in the same plane. Firends should be able to get in a bomber together. \\nAs of now, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad seems to be clearly much better. \\nIn the end, this is a good game that could be great. It really could be. Unfortunately, it’s undermined by its own developers who have been spoon fed Communist era propaganda to the point of absurdity, who then turns around and can’t help but put it in their own game, only to pull oppressive tact by silencing anyone who dares to point out such nonsense. \\nI have been waiting a long time for them to get with the program; unfortunately I am most likely waiting in vain. \\nWarthunder has become nothing but a propaganda mill, with Delusional re-writes of history where Red Army planes filled the skies and dominated over the Luftwaffe and all other nations. It’s a joke and insult to call this poor excuse of a “simulator” anything close to being “historically accurate”…only in the world of Commie make believe is this game close to anything historical. \\n\\nSadly, I’ll probably still play this game, only to be constantly reminded of how great it could be. I have given Gaijin about $100.00 of my money, and sadly I will never get its worth.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]This is an extensive review of what to expect going into another Free-To-Play game and its business practices. This review is aimed for new players looking to get into the tank part of the game.[/h1]\\n\\n[i]Note : If you are interested in aircraft or ships, skip this one.[/i]\\n\\n\\nThe game is developed by a Russian company, Gaijin - they work with another company to make the vehicle models and other individuals and contributors to get real data/information on how they performed in real life and how to best represent that in-game.\\n\\n[b]The Positives Side : [/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The graphics are stunning. Very accurate models, world detail and the new Dagor 5.0 engine did wonders for the game and they\\'ve promised even more optimizations in the recent Russian stream. The overall feeling is quite good, although the warlike atmosphere (such as smoke clouding the skies) could be a bit better. \\n[*] UK, USA, Russia, Germany, France, Japan and soon Italy will be participating in ground battles. Each nation with their own playstyle, shells, armor layouts making for a refreshing experience.\\n[*] Accurate ballistics and armor composition make for a tactical tank combat that requires knowledge before player skill. In-game stat cards give an overall idea of what the tank is capable of, how much punching power it has and what type of it can deal with. It\\'s quite a steep learning curve for the first hundred hours and even by then you\\'ll still have questions about how to deal with certain targets and what to look for. [i]Hint : Look for answers on youtube and reddit, not in-game.[/i] Rome wasn\\'t built in a day and you will certainly not understand War Thunder\\'s mechanics early on. \\n[*] The tank models are really well made. I mentioned this before and I would like to emphasize on the \"weight\" of the tank compared to Wargaming\\'s World of Tanks. You can really feel like you\\'re driving a tank and not Mario Kart. The pacing is slow in two game modes, and a bit quicker in the other one (more below).\\n[*] The sounds are excellent. From 12.7mm Anti-Air guns, to big 150mm Sturmpanzer cannon - deeper, realistic and satisfying shell sounds are what help with immersion when playing this game. \\n[*] Three game modes to please every tank player - Arcade, Realistic, Simulator. All have their differences ranging from engine power (with Simulator being the closest to real values and arcade having extra power) to aiming assistance. \\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] The Negative :[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Gaijin has to be one of the worst offenders in gaming history. If you have an extensive gaming experience you are already thinking of Nexon, Trion, EA, and half of the developers in the MMORPG market. The one thing they do not have compared to Gaijin is the [b]grip on a niche audience[/b]. You see, there\\'s no competitor to War Thunder in the entire gaming industry. World of Tanks and Armored Warfare target a different audience - one that likes arcade style hitpoints, peak-a-boo style of tank play. The audience of War Thunder is completely different. You have community members who spend an absurd amount of time finding documents, conducting research unlike in any other community you\\'ll ever see. Because there\\'s no competitor on the market for a realistic war game with tanks and aircraft/ships, [b]they own this entire audience and they know it[/b]. This company has pulled of unprecedented levels of unprofessionalism and lack of communication with the playerbase that would\\'ve grounded [b]ANY[/b] company including the owner of this store you\\'re reading this review on. Constant lies, fabricated \"sources\" and documents, selective feedback. I could go on forever here, but EA has that stigma because it was Star Wars and that hurts Americans, not because they\\'re worse than Gaijin.\\n[*] Infurating matchmaker - The matchmaker is set to +- 1 battle rating. What this means is that having your best tank a 3.7 Sherman you will at worst be matched with players that have either a 4.7 vehicle as their best, or at best with players who have a 2.7 tank as top. In lower tiers this is not really an issue, you will learn and adapt to a different playstyle. However as you move up into late World War 2 vehicles where armor really matters and further into Cold War T-54s the matchmaker becomes such a problem to the point of frustration. Depending on the game, your best tank will not be able to penetrate frontally any of the enemy teams excluding cupolas and machine gun ports (if they have one). The community has been asking for a +- 0.7 battle rating matchmaker for [b]YEARS[/b], but they haven\\'t listened and never will. Good luck fighting an American T29 heavy tank hull down on your Panther D, you will never win.\\n[*] When you get a new tank, you get a stock performance which can be further improved by researching modules such as \"Engine\", which gives a better acceleration, \"Brakes\" that help you break quicker and allow for quick retreating if you\\'re caught off-guard and many others. Among these modules you have two culprits where one of the shittiest player frustration mechanic in the game is - \"Parts\" and \"Fire Prevention Equipment\". Without the first one, you cannot repair your tank, unless you\\'re sitting on your objective. If you take a shot and your gun breech is damaged, you\\'re out of combat for the rest of the game, since shooting with a broken gun breech will detonate the shell inside your own tank. If you take a shot to your transmission you\\'ll be stationary the rest of the game. If a similar situation happens 20 seconds into the game...you can see how fun that might be. The best is FPE - if you get shot in your engine or fuel tanks, you\\'ll be set on fire. You guessed it, without this module you\\'ll continue burning until you\\'re dead. The removal of these two modules has been asked since closed beta - Gaijin refused.\\n[*] Community management - No developer reads the international forum in English. Instead there are moderators who \"forward\" suggestions to them for review. This is fine, they\\'re not required to know English, it\\'s an absurd request. The moderators on the other hand are absolute morons and worthless human beings on a power trip. If they do not like your suggestion your post will never appear. Your communication with the developer is entirely gone because no one heard it - not your fellow players who could upvote that or give feedback to you on how to improve it, or why your idea is totally wrong and you should come back with a better one. Radio silence, it\\'s gone. They shut down opinions they do not like or that highlight the Russian favoritism that is present in game (there\\'s plenty of evidence of this, ask me below if you want) and ban everyone that talks back. Truly one of the worst forums out there.\\n[/list] \\n\\nSomething to note about the community in-game : I was a bit surprised coming from World of Tanks and it\\'s cesspool. Most games go without anyone talking other than radio commands \"Attack X\", \"Defend X\", \"Follow Me\" etc. Very rarely do you get dirtbags and flame wars, it\\'s surprising in a PvP game. Usually it\\'s someone venting in [ALL] about bias, rarely personal. They\\'re far more talkative in Simulator Tank Battles, really nice as well. Overall a decent community I would say, on reddit too if you ignore some of the usual internet types. \\n\\n[b] Final thought :[/b]\\n\\nThe game itself is excellent, there\\'s nothing like it which is why I\\'ve played it for so long. It\\'s interesting, you also tend to learn things you never knew just by playing and talking to other community members - tanks, the war, other projects, prototypes and so on. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone however. The further you go, the sadder you\\'ll feel about what a company like Grinding Gear, Digital Extremes or Obsidian could\\'ve done with this. This is the best war game on the Steam store, made by the worst company.',\n",

       "  'review': 'after around 8000 hours total playtime, i cant recommend this game. it sucked me in, it removed my soul. it caused me years of addicting frustration. now there is absolutely nothing left holding me. the grind is insufferable, the stock grind encouraging you to spend real money unless you are willing to play a vehicle for 10-100 games to unlock its full potential, the higher the tier goes the worse it gets. and also the more noticable the stock syndrom becomes. this game is beginner unfriendly, bad match making. Gaijin over the years has turned into nothing but a greedy company. they used to care alot more about the game  back in the days, and in my opinion, the moment they decided to add the IS6 it all went downhill, because what followed after sooner or later were top tier premiums. before they never touched that, there werent nearly as many power creeping ridiculously viable premium machines. let alone beginners ruining high tier just because they opened their wallet, its ridiculous, pathetic, and infuriating. the only good thing i have to say about this game is arcade tanks nowadays and arcade/realistic air for props. jets are a no go. the more modern jet games all end within 3-8 minutes starting the moment you spawn on the runway. the f100 era and alike are barely playable because of guess what, pay to win jets you can see, that have missiles you cannot defend against in most subsoncis, let alone most super sonics, of course its also the premiums that get the good missiles and counter measures 90% of the time.\\ni have never seen a game thats in such a pathetic and awful state as war thunder.\\ntouching anything above ww2 era honestly just makes me suicidal. blatant and obvious cash grabs, there is absolutely nothing else to this game anymore.\\nsure the game might be fun for the first 100-1000 hours for any beginner that decides to stick with gaijins BS but the flaws sooner or later will be noticed by said beginners to a point where they cant enjoy the game anymore either.\\nand dont get me started on the piss poor map design, its nonexistent, its either brawl maps or maps where you camp at 5KM distance, and both suck. the map designing is just as bad as in world of tanks lmao.\\nthe only time where jet gameplay for super sonics becomes fun is the EC maps (basically gigantic maps) but they only happen rarely in the rotation.\\nthen gaijin has poor noodle coding, where a bug fix causes 2 new bugs. a new feature causes 5 other bugs.\\nits a never ending nightmare at this point.\\nreally just dont ever start playing this game for the sake of your own sanity, and if you do, i can assure you that anyone will be fed up within 100-1000 hours even if they turn into a god tier player with a solid 5-10 KD.\\nmy PoV is being an above average player, but lets be real here 95% of the active playerbase currently are just average players with a 1-1.5KD.^\\n\\nupdate 1,\\nnow there has been a very fun memory leak with all games modes except for air realistic/arcade\\nmeaning that you gotta restart the game every 3-6 games of ground, helicopters, and naval.\\nhow long has this problem existed now? i dont know the specific time but lets just say the last big patch did that, or maybe even the big patch before that. all of my friends who play wt experience the same memory leak issues btw.\\n\\nas you can see and like i described above, new bugs just start showing up, and this time gaijin doesnt even bother fixing something as critical as that.\\nhow unexpected.',\n",

       "  'review': 'would be the best online tank/plane game there is IF, Gaijin wasn\\'t as greedy as they are. They\\'ve become increasingly money hunrgy, and have now launched their own \"market\" where you can buy tanks/plane, that were preaviously only available if you put in a lot of time to do a challenge in a specific time.\\n\\nnow however they offer their own \"lootboxes\" where you can get these vhicles and just sell them on their own market (which uses their own curency ofcourse, that you can\\'t turn into real life cash). The people that originaly went through the effort of getting these vheicles then get nothing but a big middle finger in return. Because they know long time players wont leave (atleast not completely, mabye just a break for a few months) because there\\'s no other game out there like it.\\n\\ni just hate to see a game i\\'ve played so much slowly go down the shitter, just for some easy cash instead of fixing big issues that have been there for the start. Instead of fixing the gameplay or adding more stuff to do, like new game modes, They just add more tanks/planes... ect. because that\\'s how they get some easy cash.\\n\\nalso they may have added helicopters and boats, but you gotta PAY TO TEST THEM FOR GAIJIN. Boats should have been releaced a year or two ago, but no, they know that if they keep it in \"closed beta\" they\\'ll earn way more money off it, because then the people who love the game and have seen most of what it has already, will have to buy a 40$ hellicopter/boat instead of just playing the regualr old cluster fuck that is tank or air realisitc battles. so now both boats and planes are in beta, and probably will be for another century..\\n\\n\\nI just rambled through this entire review, but i really care for the game and the community, but the devs are as shady as you get, one of the tips they give new players is \"spend some cash\"',\n",

I understand that I have many an hour in this game, however the last 1000 hours have largely been of the same line ups with no noticeable progress in research. this game will leave you bitter and unwilling to do what is actually fun.

No game simulates armor, ammo, penetration and post pen damage like War Thunder.\\n\\nBut the developers are greedy, even for a FTP game design.\\n\\nBalance is a mess, the grind is impossible, even as a premium account player, within reasonable time frames.  Repair costs are ridiculous and the game is, in part, balanced around the repair costs (which is stupid).  A conventional 4 engine bomber can cost 30,000 to repair while a modern jet bomber costs a third of that.  Say what?\\n\\nThe Battle Rating system is too compressed so that when you fight tanks a full BR higher than you, you can be in an early post WWII tank fighting IFVs with ATGMs.\\n\\nI am a high hour, premium account player, and for some reason more than 85% of my games are uptiers and more than 50% are FULL uptiers, making it challenging to research new tanks and make SLs to pay for repairs.\\n\\nI love it. I hate it.  Don't play it if you value your sanity.  I used it as an anger management tool.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'When I first died in this game I was killed by a savage grunt called Krosh the Chop. He killed me in an outpost when i was fighting 4 captains at the same time. So he became a captain. I was mad so I decided to hunt him down but when I went to his nemesis mission he absolutely destroyed me because fighting savages in this game gives you cancer. With all that rage I decided to go after him for the final time. I interrogated a worm and learned that.. Krosh will instantly die to fire. I always fought him next to hundreds of grog barrels but never decided to shoot one. So I find Krosh and lure him to a grog barrel and shoot it. He burns to death. \\n\\nWhen I was going to Shelob\\'s cave in Cirith Ungol a familiar orc screamed \"ranger!\" It was Krosh again. He had cheated death but he was different this time. Instead of being called Krosh the Chop he was now called Krosh the Flame of War. He was wielding burning axes, his face was burnt and he was immune to fire this time. Sadly for him I had just learned how to kill savages so I used my new skills on him. He was not a strong target.\\n\\nAfter 30 In-Game hours I get a quest about killing a necromancer. When I arrived in Minas Mithil to kill the necromancer I see a familiar Orc between all those level 50 orcs i slayed recently. An orc that I used to mourn. A level 8 orc to be exact. Instead of attacking the necromancer i decide to see who this guy is. Turns out he is the one and only, Krosh the Flame of War. But this time instead of killing him I decide to recruit him. I hit him twice and he breaks. I recruit him and he joins my ranks as a level 14 captain. \\n\\nI train him and send him to fight pits for him to level up. Surprisingly he is very good at slaying anyone thats twice his level. I force him to murder all other captains in my ranks even the ones that sent me gifts. It was all going well until he came across Az-Agur War Master. A level 62 Olog. It was a very close battle but sadly Az Agur crushed Krosh under his giant mace. I kill Az Agur as soon as Krosh fell. I attempt to revive Krosh but I fail.. \\n\\nIn the loving memory of Krosh the Flame of War aka Krosh the Chop. May he rest in flame.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is perfect to me, here\\'s why: \\n\\nAfter I had gotten the ability to recruit enemy captains, I saw there was an achievement to shame an Assassin Captain until they become deranged. I attempted this with one called Dûsh. The second time I saw him, his title was rebranded to \"Dûsh the Shamed\" and he told me how terrible his life was now and how all the other Orcs were laughing at him, after which I fought him and shamed him again. The next time I saw him he became \"Dûsh the Unshamed\" and told me how he reveled in the title and embraced it and Orcs respected him more, he became even more powerful than he was at first, and I got a sense of comradery and respect for Dûsh. I chose to shame him again. \\n\\nThe next time I saw Dûsh the achievement I desired popped up, except this time Dûsh wasn\\'t speaking anymore, he was just making noises that sounded like a cartoon airplane stalling in the air (which made me laugh everytime I heard them, though now I realize they may have been his way of expressing his suffering). This is when I recruited him to be one of my captains. After some short time, he betrayed me. I had it coming. I deserved it. I thought I\\'d be able to recruit him again, except this time he had Iron Will, which meant he was unrecruitable and couldn\\'t be friendly ever again. It was either I shame him again, or him and I fight to the death. Not being able to repeat the same mistake I made already, I thought to myself \"So this is it, old friend\" and fought him. I won. Defeating him gave me a very powerful legendary although the price was far from worth it. I just wanted Dûsh back. \\n\\nAll of this isn\\'t part of the game\\'s story, it\\'s unscripted, it\\'s made up from randomly generated logic-branches of code that is nearly guaranteed to be impossible to get for anyone else, let alone my other playthroughs. The story Dûsh and I shared is special, it\\'s our story. I\\'m sorry it had to come to this, Dûsh. Forgive me, old friend',\n",

       "  'review': 'Middle-earth: Shadow of War is one of my favorite games of all time for one massive, outstanding reason.\\n\\nThe Nemesis System\\n\\nTo this date, I have yet to encounter anything as dynamic, fun, unpredictable, and exciting in a story driven combat game as the Nemesis System.  I have over 300 hours in Shadow of War, and out of that 200 hours were spent after I had completed the main campaign and 2 DLCs, completing every collectible and questline.  200 hours after the game was essentially \"completed\".\\n\\nThe experience of how your character interacts with the uruk enemies and how the enemies interact with you and each other is simply spectacular.  An example out of dozens I could give:  I return to Nurnen after several tours of duty in the other provinces, holding off numerous sieges and having to replenish and restructure my army\\'s ranks.  Upon my return, I face an all out insurrection in my ranks.  Three of my captains and a warchief all decide to betray me in a coordinated ambush to start a full-on UPRISING against me.  In the process, they bring one of my still loyal captains out and kill him in front of me.  In total, I\\'ve just lost 5 captains in an instant and gained 4 new enemies.  The next 2-3 hours were spent systematically hunting down every one of these traitors and punishing them in different ways.\\n\\nOne I outright killed in the first battle.  He got off easy.  One I forcibly re-recruited and demoted.  The other 2 I shamed into absolute despair.  One\\'s mind broke and I killed him, only for him to cheat death and return for more punishment.  The last one I forcibly recruited so I could execute him by making his head explode.  Through all this, I put the fear of Mordor through the rest of my ranks, and there has yet to be another uprising like that since.\\n\\nThe orcs (uruks and ologs) remember everything that happens to them.  They remember if you threw them off a cliff or burned them.  They remember up to a point how many times they\\'ve killed you or how many times you\\'ve had to run from them.  They even call each other by name and have rivalries and alliances within their own ranks.  Sometimes a warchief will step down from his high place to defend one of his favorite bodyguards.  Sometimes an assassin will track you from one province to another and ambush you when you least expect it.\\n\\nAnd the best part?  None of this was scripted.  All of this happened after the main campaign was long, long over.  The Nemesis System rewards the creative and adventurous player with amazing encounter after another.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a fan of Lord of the Rings fighting and stealth games.\\n\\nIf you like exciting and interesting AI enemies with personality and unpredictable behaviors.\\n\\nIf you\\'re a sick bastard who enjoys killing, torturing, and mind controlling the evil.\\n\\nLook no further.  Buy Shadow of War.',\n",

The full story is about 5 pages long and occured over roughly 4 hours of gameplay, so I'm opting for list format here. Note: A 'Death Threat' draws an orc out of hiding and increases their loot, but levels them up considerably. 'Shaming' lowers their level and makes them easier to recruit/convert to your side. Okay here we go...\\n\\n1) I recruited an orc assassin named Zugor the Kingslayer\\n2) I also recruited an olog-hai tank named Az-Adar the Pit Fighter\\n3) They became blood brothers (super-duper orc best friends)\\n4) Az-Adar became my favorite fighter\\n                ...fast forward to good part...\\n5) I decide to do an ambush mission for orc xp.\\n6) The ambush grows out of control (at this point it's me, 3 friendly captains, 3 enemy captains, plus armies)\\n7) Az-Adar shows up (Yay, help!)\\n8) Az-Adar betrays me (F**k)\\n9) Zugor teams up with Az-Adar (Double f**k)\\n10) I kill Az-Adar, Zugor is now royally ticked off.\\n11) I defeat and shame Zugor, Zugor flees (battle ends)\\n12) I send Zugor a death threat\\n13) Zugor is now Zugor the Unashamed (Legendary stats + a new culty look)\\n14) Zugor kills me\\n16) I send Zugor another death threat\\n17) I defeat and shame Zugor (He flees)\\n18) I track down and ambush Zugor (with the intent to convert him back)\\n19) Az-Adar (no longer dead and a legendary badass as well) shows up mid-battle as an undead abomination (Zugor's culty new outfit apparently granted him Dr. Frankenstein powers).\\n20) I kill Zugor\\n21) Zombie Az-Adar is now super ticked off and gains crazy health and damage\\n22) Epic 'Big Boss Battle' fight scene ensues\\n23) I defeat and shame Zombie Az-Adar\\n24) Zombie Az-Adar flees, but loses “Iron-Will” (I can mind control him again)\\n25) I ambush Zombie Az-Adar a final time\\n26) I recruit Zombie Az-Adar with mind control\\n27) I use Zombie Az-Adar to take over the entire region and kill everything\\n28) I promote Zombie Az-Adar to Overlord\\n\\nTL;DR: Two randomly generated orc NPCs made a better story than the entire campaign.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"What I love most about this game is that your encounter with every single orc has the potential to turn into an epic story.\\n\\nThere was this time when a berserker decided to bury his axe into my stomach, and he was promoted to a captain. Upon respawning, I decided to track him down and re-arrange his face with my sword. Our brief encounter ended with him being thrown off a ledge and falling to his death, I thought nothing of it at the time.\\n\\nLittle did I know I would encounter that same orc time after time again, the dude just wouldn't stay dead. Regardless of the injuries he sustained, he would always be back. I recognised this orc's admirable endurance for punishment, so naturally I decided to dominate him. \\n\\nHe served as my bodyguard for many hours, and we went on countless conquests together. We attacked and defended forts, cut down enemy captains whilst adding others to my army. This orc began as a grunt, and has risen through the ranks, becoming a captain, an epic captain, and finally a legendary warchief. His bloodlust seemed endless, and unfortunately that was the case.\\n\\nRecently I was wandering around Gorgoroth and tracking down an enemy captain. The fight was brutal but eventually his head was separated from his body, and his supporters fled. I was low on health and learned a valuable lesson moments after as my favourite orc decided to betray me.\\n\\nPerhaps it was my fault, I'd aided this orc in all his encounters and made sure he was victorious. I assigned him as a warchief, helped him become legendary, and inadvertently deluded him into thinking he could take on the Bright Lord.\\n\\nHis followers were slaughtered, and I regretfully executed the masterpiece I had created. Or did I? Perhaps he survived his fatal injuries like all the other times. If so, I look forward to introducing him to my Drake.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Is Shadow of War worth buying in 2021?[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Short Answer: YES!![/b]\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2238331578\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2232829285\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2265216731\\n\\n\\n[h1]Shadow of War is one of the most enjoyable game I have ever played[/h1] \\nEven after all these years I still go back to play it again once in a while. This game doesn't end when the story is over. It's absolutely worth getting, especially on sale. The online portion is still played by many. It’s not pvp though so don't expect that. The Online conquest is a sort of pve game mode but the forts which you can attack are set up by actual people, so you'll never really find the same setup all the time. You can send your overlord on an online pit fight or you fight against other people’s fortresses that they've stocked with, usually, their best orcs. Online vendetta is similar but is more like missions where you are going after an orc from other players’ game who has killed them. You can also defeat and recruit orcs from other players forts. The same way, if any of your precious orc unfortunately dies in any of these online conquests you will lose them for good.\\n\\n[h1]The Nemesis System and combat gameplay are what keep me coming back[/h1] \\nThe combat is similar to the likes of Assassins Creed and the Batman Arkham games but much better in my opinion. The abilities, combos etc are really fluid and satisfying. It’s not just hack and slash, you have to use your brain before going after different types of orcs. Higher tier Orcs will have multiple immunities, rages and strengths along with certain weaknesses. You can have to exploit them in your advantage, by tracking down a Worm. For example, there are orcs who are immune to arrows, executions, fire etc. Fortress captains tend to have more strengths than weaknesses, so you have to be careful with that. You have to plan your ambush/attack and prepare before joining a fight.\\nThanks to the unique, intricate & superbly designed content generator named ‘Nemesis system’ I never got bored at finding interesting AI orcs with personality, unpredictable behaviour and catchy, comedic/provocative dialogues. Not to mention certain death defying orcs who just would not stay dead. No matter how much punishment they go through they still sometimes resurrect and ambush. You might think that the best thing to do here is dominate and recruit them but they can still betray you later!! The Nemesis System also rewards creative and adventurous players with new story lines and breath-taking encounters one after another. The system even turns some orcs into truly memorable enemies.\\n\\n[h1]Furthermore[/h1]\\nThe game’s visuals and landscapes are sublime. The story can easily rival the masterpiece that is The Lord of the Rings trilogy. This story driven game also has some intriguing plot twists that is worth mentioning.\\nThe in game unlockable gear sets including rings, bows, swords, armors, cloaks, daggers, hammers, masks are quite remarkable. I didn’t have to grind very hard to get them. \\nWhile playing the game I became addicted to fighting Orcs, hunting them down, confronting those that betrayed me or killed my Captains. After levelling up and acquiring new sets of skills/abilities I felt a sense of unique and divine Godly power….it’s hard to describe with words. I also formed a bond with Talion not just to avenge the slaughtering of his whole family but through his morals and belief in a better world – a better Mordor.\\n\\n[h1]DLC[/h1]\\nThere are two DLC available which are slightly different as you play different characters (Eltariel & Baranor) in them. You get Nemesis expansions: a number of new Tribes, new orcs, tribal weapons, legendary gear sets, new fortress & regions and obviously new missions. They tie this game’s story nicely with the earlier story of Shadow of Mordor.\\n\\n\\n[h1] Any gripes?[/h1]\\nAlthough certain aspects of the game like brutal killing, torturing, and mind controlling the evil can be fun for many people but might be little too much for certain faint hearted ones 😂\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nIn my honest opinion, even if you are not a big fan of Lord of the Rings or not much familiar with it, it’s a pretty safe bet you'll get your money’s worth in Shadow of War definitive edition.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Genuinely one of the best games I\\'ve ever played. It starts out a little boring, since the only thing to do aside from the main story is killing orcs, but once you reach Act II, the game really picks up, since it allows you to have many interactions with the same orc captains, and form relationships with them.\\n\\nThe combat is fluid and fun enough to keep the typical person entertained through Act I, but it\\'s not really what the core of the game is. The core of the game is the Nemesis System. Basically what the Nemesis System does is that when an enemy kills you, they get more powerful, but more than that, they remember that they killed you. Not to mention that your enemies can occasionally cheat death if you kill them, and they\\'ll remember that you killed them, so they\\'ll come back with a figurative axe to grind and a literal axe in their head. I feel like the best aspects of the Nemesis System could best be demonstrated through stories.\\n\\nOne of my late-game nemeses was Zoruk Runnybowels. Yes, his name referenced his diarrhea, trust me, he was more intimidating than he sounds. He was the bane of my existence throughout Gorgoroth, but eventually I got together a team of 3 of captains that worked for me, and sent them all to murder Zoruk dead. We succeeded! Then he cheated death almost immediately, and went right back to kicking my ass, except now it was personal for him.\\n\\nHe killed me, and that\\'s when I discovered that he had killed me so many times he got promoted to Warchief. I could draw him out in a warchief mission, but instead I continued building my army. I eventually had an army whom\\'s strength I trusted, and we went to capture the fortress. This was where I finally put an end to Zoruk Runnybowels. We captured the first of 4 victory points, guarded by Zoruk, and he began running to protect the next point. I would not allow this.\\n\\nI shadow-strike pulled him back to me, and we participated in a 1v1 battle. I actually even killed some of the grunts who came to help me, because I felt that would be unfair to Zoruk, and I wanted him to know he lost. In a video game. I felt like I had something to prove to an NPC.\\n\\nSince we\\'d already captured the victory point, no grunts came to help Zoruk either, and I managed to bring him down to zero health. He fell on his knee, and I was prepared for the coming QTE to land the finishing blow, when he started giving a speech. I don\\'t recall exactly what he said here, but I\\'m just gonna say he quoted Thanos and said \"You should have gone for the head.\" He got back up, revealing he had the Death Defying trait, and by now he had adapted to most of my different types of attacks, so he kicked my ass.\\n\\nI tried a second attempt to capture the fortress, and things went similarly at first. We captured the victory point, I got a 1v1 duel with Zoruk, but instead of bringing him down to zero health, once he was broken I grabbed him. Since we were in Gorgoroth, there was a river of lava running right down the streets of the fortress, so I tossed Zoruk into the lava.\\n\\nI went on to capture the fortress, and finally breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that Zoruk was finally gone... Until he cheated death again, coming back as Zoruk the Flame of War. But that\\'s a story for another day.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Prologe:\\nHoly Moly, this game. Where do I even start.\\n\\nAt the very beginning, I guess. \\nLast weekend I decided to get Shadow of Mordor in the Humble Bundle. It was cheap and I wanted to look into it for a long time. I liked the idea of the nemesis system and wanted to experience it myself. Maybe I would even like it? Oh past-me, little did you know...\\nI ran through the game in like 15h. The nemesis system was awsome, but the game was way too easy after a few hours of playing. I didnt need to prepare for fights anymore and almost everyone standing in my way. The only hard fights were the ones with my nemesis. So I read some reviews about Shadow of War. \\nI read about the Nemesis Difficulty, the Improvements that were made and the much less clumsy controlls. Building an army with the dominated orks and capturing forts and regions?? Sign me up!\\nSo, while finishing the last few quests of SoM I was already downloading SoW in the background.\\n-----------------\\nThe Nemesis System:\\nThis game is EVERYTHING SoM wanted to be, and way more.\\nI am playing Shadow of War on Nemesis Difficulty, and I would everyone advise to do so. Here is why:\\nYou will get smacked around, you will get burned, poisoned, killed A FRIGGIN LOT.\\nBUT... it will force you to use the whole range of the nemesis system to strike down your enemies.\\nYou will need to study them, you have to outmove them and use every little weakness they have. You will need allies, you will need them at the right place in the right time, with the right weapons, damage types and abilities. This game became the most fun and addicting strategy-assassins-creed-batman-mixup, with probbably the most dynamic game world I have every experienced.\\nThe Orcs and Uruks will fight against you, yes, but whats way more important and amazing to watch: They will fight against each other for ranks, they will ally with each other, betray each other... if you give them the time and the space they will restructure their whole army from within without your help. Its an completely independent eco system of individuals. Every orc has its own unique characteristics and cant be compared to any other one. They are procedural  generated, yes, but it just doesnt feel like they are. Some you will hate, some you will like... and there even will be some who you are willing to save in a battle, because they are potential allies (or are already yours) and you dont want to lose them. You can steer the outcome of some of their fights, eliminate or recruit the orcs, give them orders to kill someone or spy on their commander... you can never controll the whole system, and thats exactly what it makes so unpredictable and exciting. This game offers the most interesting version of chess that I have every played in my life.\\nThere is so much more to say, I cant cover every part of the system. It just would consume to much time. Just one more thing: IMO this system is revolutionary for videogames of the future. It will be hard to go back to generic boss fights and boring and forced encounters in other games. \\n\\n-----------------\\nThe Gameplay:\\n\\nNot only the dynamics of the nemesis system are amazing (even tho its the very best part of the game, not even a question IMO), but also the development of your character. The skills that are available to you give you full controll over the playstyle you want to use. You want to go full berserk? Sure! You are more of a stealthy player and want to kill you foes without someone noticing? We you covered! You want to rely on your trusted allies and buff them, or ride beasts and kill with their help or from their back, or you want to power up your spectral form to smash everyone around you with special and elemental attacks, or you are more of a far fighter and would like to strike them down with your bow and arrow? Do whatever you like! Oh, you want to do all of this in combination? Well, you need some more levels for that but... hey, what gives, knock yourself out, mate!\\n\\nThe freedom this game offers gameplaywise is sheer incredible.\\n\\nDid I mention that you can buff and differ your attacks and playstyle with looted weapons, armor and other items, too?\\nOh, and if you like one item in particular... well, just upgrade it to your level and take it with you into the next battle!\\nIn this game a whole lot of micromanagement is needed... and I love every last bit of it!\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------\\nEpiloge:\\nYou want to hear something funny? It took me about 25h tho conquer the first fort... not because it was so incredibly hard, but because there is so much to do, and if you are willing to do all of it this game probably offers hundreds of hours of playtime. Well, what can I say... It suck me in completely.\\nEverything you just read happened and is offered by the game till the middle of Act II (there are 4). There is probably much more to come. After the first conquer the map opened up again... and it blew my head straight off.\\nBuy it, experience it, love it. Surely it worth its 40 Bucks, but somethimes its on sale for about 15. Thats one hell of a deal. \\n\\nThank you for reading this far and I hope you liked this hyped up review. \\nThere would be so much to say, but for now I am done and I think I need a shower. \\nOver and out.',\n",

       "  'review': 'As an avid Tolkien reader and a lover of WB Arkham-style combat, and being someone who really enjoyed Shadow of Mordor, I have a lot of conflicting feelings about this game.\\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed it and I think the game + the DLCs at $40 is worth the value.\\n\\nWhat the game does right:\\n- Combat is smooth and fun.\\n- New abilities that make fights feel a bit more diverse and creates situations where you really have to think your way through a Captain fight.\\n- The design, graphics, sounds, and music are fantastic.\\n- New armors and weapons/new gear sets.\\n- Orcs all have a ton of personality, and encounters feel very organic.\\n- The Nemesis system adds just the right level of challenge and personal investment when you get a really tough Captain.\\n- Skins which let you visually appear as other characters.\\n- Eltariel (this might be an unpopular opinion)\\n\\nWhat the game doesn\\'t do so well:\\n- While orcs have a ton of personality, a lot of them are too silly, and in some places, completely lore-breaking.  I realize that the intention is to be fun, but a lot of orc personalities really kill the feeling of dread and anticipation in finding that next brutal Captain.\\n- It\\'s hard to tell, but the game seems like it could still use some optimizing, even in 2021.  With less than half of my VRAM being used, I still see frame drops in places where it seems like there shouldn\\'t be.\\n- The story itself is rather short and not quite satisfying to get through.  In particular, the DLCs are very short with sequences that are disappointingly easy to get through.\\n- After awhile, the game feels like all you\\'re doing is micromanaging and min/maxing your Captains to grind through the endgame content (which is very repetitive).\\n- I don\\'t agree with some of the creative liberties the writers took with the story of Lord of the Rings.  The attempt to weave Talion\\'s/Eltariel\\'s/Baranor\\'s stories into the story of LOTR itself does not always integrate well, and at times is just a complete deviance from Tolkien\\'s writing.  The writers definitely know their lore, but the decisions on how to create a new storyline from it just fall flat at times.\\n- The story sequences which should provide the biggest amount of buildup and amount of closure all feel rushed and unsatisfying.  There were several characters throughout the story who I wanted to see more of, and they just sort of disappeared without a mention when their short arcs were over.  \\n- The loot box fiasco at launch I think hamstrung this game from the start.  WB\\'s inability to read the \"climate change\" of gaming at the time, and not learn from the boycotts that had already happened against other games caused (what I believe to be) poor decisions to be made from a product prioritization perspective.  The loot boxes gave nothing of any real value and caused launch to make this game feel like a generic army builder mobile game.\\n\\n\\nSo.....do I recommend it?  If you\\'re a Middle Earth fan, it\\'s gotta be a yes, but get it on sale.  It\\'s still incredibly satisfying to hop on, slaughter hundreds of orcs, and call it a day.  If you\\'re a Tolkien fan and are looking for a really solid lore-friendly story....I\\'ll say your mileage may vary, but I still think you\\'ll have fun with it.  For all the gripes and critiques I have, I still think I\\'ll be playing this one from time to time until the next one comes out (if it does).  Various difficulty modes do help in offering variety in gameplay experience, but they can\\'t really make up for the less-savory parts of the story and dialogue.',\n",

       "  'review': 'So I just finished the game 100% and I feel conflicted.\\n\\nI\\'ll just start by saying: I think it\\'s a good game. It\\'s fun. I would never spend 80$ for it but I don\\'t think I\\'d spend 80$ on any game nowadays. But I do recommend the game.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played Shadow of Mordor and liked it, you should play this game. It\\'s (obviously) a lot like the first game, except everything is better. It\\'s a lot more fun, there\\'s more stuff to do, the gameplay feels even nicer, the nemesis system feels more important, fortress assaults are tons of fun (although they do get tedious, more on that later). \\n\\nIf you\\'ve never played the first game (this is a sequel), then it doesn\\'t really matter. A lot of what you do in this game is similar to what you do in the first game. The story of the first game was more compelling to me in the first game but it doesn\\'t really matter. They do a fairly good job of putting you in context.\\n\\nThe first thing I would like to address is the story... I love Tolkien\\'s universe. I love the lore. Even then I really cannot claim to be that savvy about it, I read some of the books, know a few things about the ones I haven\\'t but I can\\'t claim to know that much about it. Even then, everything about the story in this game feels off, to the point where not long after starting it, I found it almost cringy. At some point I was almost frustrated with it. Truth is, this is not much more than an elaborate fan fiction.\\n\\nMy understanding is that Monolith wanted to make a cool game and decided to bend everything else around it to make a good game. No matter how fucked the lore is in this game, I think they actually did a pretty good job in that regard.\\n\\nIt might be an odd comparison but it reminds me of \"Black Flag\". You know, the Assassin\\'s Creed game that everybody refers to using its subtitle because the only reason it\\'s an assassin\\'s creed game is to profit off of the franchise\\'s name? It was a pirate game and it did an excellent job at that... So why make it have anything to do with Assassin\\'s Creed? That\\'s a bit how I feel about Shadow of War, honestly.\\n\\nI feel like there\\'s so little that actually makes sense lore-wise that they might as well have made their own game. They were clearly not limiting themselves seeing how they warped the lore to suit their game so just imagining what they could have produced if they weren\\'t tied to something that already exists. I see it as playing it really safe by using a well-known franchise.\\n\\nThe target audience is very clear too. The depiction of everything is based off of Peter Jackson\\'s movies. Things are made to be very epic and gritty and cool and full of action. Things like the Eye of Sauron or Sauron\\'s armor are taken directly from the movies as well. The game is targeted towards people who saw the movies, liked it and want some sort of expansion on them while being able to murder orcs.\\n\\nNow, as frustrating as I found all of this at first... They did a pretty damn good job at it. The protagonist feels super bad ass, you unlock new abilities that expands how you fight, what you can do and make you look even cooler. You\\'ll even want to switch between abilities depending on what you\\'re doing or who you\\'re fighting. Having an immortal ultra bad-ass protagonist makes no fucking sense lore-wise but it feels cool so whatever. When you accept that the game is not cannon at all and just appreciate the exaggerated action and speeches and all, it\\'s fun.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen people talk about bugs and honestly in 40-60 hours of play time I\\'ve had my share as well: Getting stuck in invisible collisions, falling out of world, game soft-locking when a captain\\'s talking etc. It\\'s annoying but I\\'ve seen a lot worse. I think that people complaining about this don\\'t realize how elaborate all of this is and how insane the idea of producing a bug-free game is. You have no idea what the game was earlier in development and I can tell you that the end result is outstanding, all things considered.\\n\\nThe level of polish is actually insane. Not being able to skip a lot of the cutscenes is sort of frustrating but even after playing for so long... I\\'ve rarely heard the same lines more than once. This is incredible to me and always made me curious to hear what the next orc was going to say. Even the speeches the Overlords make, how their lines change if they\\'ve killed you once or more, if they got promoted etc. It makes the game feel very alive. It does something that so many games fail to do: It makes you feel like your character and the characters around him are real and have personalities.\\n\\nYou also have to appreciate the quality of the PC release. Just like Shadow of Mordor, the PC port/version is so well made. There are tons of options for graphics settings, the game is well optimized (despite people complaining it runs poorly), the way Render vs Display resolution is implemented is one of the best I\\'ve seen on any game. There\\'s an option that dynamically adjusts render resolution to maintain a specific frame rate and it works very well.\\n\\nI did not have any problems with micro-transactions because I didn\\'t buy them. You absolutely don\\'t need them, the game is not that hard and it doesn\\'t really take that long to reach max level. The fort assaults are super fun but near the end of the game that\\'s essentially all you do (that\\'s what everyone is referring to when they say the game is grindy). I have to admit I had fun up until the last 4 ones or so. It was getting frustrating, long, I was tired of the game \"pausing\" to let captains speak one by one when there are 10 of them and the \"true ending\" was disappointing.\\n\\nThere are already a lot of people who have talked about all these things in great details. What I can say is that gameplay wise, the game is fun and will be fun for a good 40-50 hours, which is more than I wanted anyway.\\n\\nLove it or hate it, it\\'s another one of those action-adventure game except it\\'s very well-made, well-polished, the interactions with orcs are fun, gameplay is fun. Get it when it\\'s cheaper and includes all the DLCs, the expansions are 20$ each for very little content right now, I haven\\'t played them myself and honestly can\\'t be bothered for that price.',\n",

       "  'review': '[u]What I liked: [/u]\\n[list]\\n    [*]More depth in the Nemesis System\\n    [*]Sieges and Dragons\\n[/list]\\n[u]What I didn’t like: [/u]\\n[list]\\n    [*] End game is pointless and boring\\n    [*]Loot aspect was weak in design\\n[/list]\\n[u]More in depth: [/u]\\n[list]\\n    [*]The main concern me and I know everyone who wants to buy the game but hasn’t. Does the game still have the lingering effects of the pay to win at launch? I can say no; the grind isn’t any longer than the first game. So if you are worried about that don’t be.\\n\\n    [*]So a lot of the new systems they added were meant for people to buy like money, orcs and loot. I never had problems of finding orcs, loot or money. If you just play the game normally, you’ll never run into issues. The only way these can be grindy is if you go in the “end game” that will require a lot of investment in maximizing your stuff, but the game isn’t that good to warrant playing it for beyond the main game imo.\\n \\n    [*]Now onto the actual game, the combat is basically the same with some new powers thrown in the mix. You also have a hammer as a ranged weapon if you want. The loot that you get changes how you look and later in the game you go, the cooler they look.  The sets that you get and how to upgrade them were really stupid. They only level up at set levels and by recruiting a certain type of orc. It’s not really worth the hassle as the bonuses aren’t really that great. Don’t expect Warframe, Diablo level quality here. The progression is very basic and personally feels lazy.\\n\\n    [*]The nemesis system is improved from the first one, more variation, more stats, types of bosses, and easier to read what they are. This system really makes the fighting and banter feel personalized and forces different tactics to overcome them. I don’t think I ever heard the same dialogue used more than once or twice. They did a good job here.\\n\\n    [*]The other main reason I was interested in this game was the sieges. The main campaign gives you I think 5 or 6 sieges to do, with some defending thrown in there. Here you pick your army commanders, up to 5, pick what you’re taking into battle, like what type of catapults, archers and soldiers. If you time it right you can take out enemy commanders to weaken their base like no alarms, weaker walls or no catapults. They gave the right amount to play because after you beat the game this is all you do. The seiges are somewhat more spectacle than a real seige. You still do basically all the work.\\n\\n    [*]The main reason for the paid content was for after you beat the game. Here you get progressively harder sieges that require you to recruit higher level orcs, get better gear and spend a lot of currency that is no longer buyable to help you out here. I did like 3 sieges before I gave up on the boring grind, the game isn’t that good to warrant playing it that much.\\n\\n    [*]Overall the story is weak and I skipped over most of it, the combat is that batman arkham style that you will either love or hate. The improved nemesis system and siege combat with some looting that wasn’t all bad, was fun enough for the time I played. The end game and loot progression felt tacked on and is a huge boring grind. If you didn’t like the first one, this won’t change your mind. Otherwise it’s fun dumb game to play and chop orcs with while you wait for another game to play.\\n\\n [/list]\\n\\n[h1]My Score: [/h1]\\n[b]C [/b]\\n\\n[b]Paid: $17 [/b]\\n[b]Completed in: 29 hours [/b]\\n\\nGames similar I recommend: \\n[list]\\n    [*]Batman Arkham Series  [url=https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/208650]Arkham Knight review[/url]\\n    [*] Assassins Creed\\n    [*] The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt [url=https://store.steampowered.com/recommended/recommendgame/292030]review[/url]\\n [/list]',\n",

       "  'review': 'I was fighting with some PITA enemy captain who was immune to vault/execution/poison/flame. I was swarmed by minions and also got ambushed by 2 other enemy captains. I made a mistake and I was nearly killed but avoided death by the last chance mechanism. Just as I was going to strike the final blow, I mistakenly pressed spacebar and tried to vault over the goddamn captain. Not surprisingly, he pushed me off and immediately countered me. My health bar depleted to zero and I collapsed on my knees. Just as I was watching helplessly, him raising his spear to deliver the final blow, suddenly A GIANT TROLL appeared behind me, grabbed the enemy by his head, lifted him to waist level and just like the Mountain squashed the head of Oberyn Martell in GoT, my bodyguard, WHOM I DID NOT CALL UPON, painted me with the enemy\\'s bashed skull pieces and brains, alongside with blood.\\n\\nAs I got up, he turned to me and said \"I AM ALWAYS HERE WHEN YOU NEED ME BOSS, WHETHER YOU CALL ME OR NOT\".\\n\\nThat\\'s why I love this game. The amount of epic moments, the randomness, the fun, the humor and the gore. This game has an insane replay value, no encounter is the same as the previous one. They really nailed to create a really dynamic world and random encounters all throughout the game. \\n\\nThis is why I play this game when I need to blow off some steam, when I have limited time to play.

       "  'review': \"[h1]A solid game that will live through the years[/h1]\\n\\nThe greatest thing about Shadow of War, but also Shadow of Mordor and pretty much all the LOTR-related games?\\nEveryone can pick them up, and really love and enjoy them even if they're not into the lore of 'em.\\nYou see, LOTR was never my thing, it's one of the fictional universes i could never really bond with, so i don't know much about the lore itself. I did see some movies, and made some Gandalf memes in my days but that's all my interaction with this franchise.\\nHowever, LOTR games were always goddamn amazing in terms of actual gameplay, they managed to keep having a constant good and satisfying gameplay throughout all these years.\\n\\nI have to admit, i barely paid any attention to the story, and with me not having much knowledge about LOTR space, there's not much for me to say about it. I even skipped a big part of the cutscenes, well... except for Shelob's (:D)\\nIn SOW, you get some new weapons and skills, there are some new enemies, and overall the world is much much bigger, however, i would've preferred even more weapons and less skills, because at times, these new abilities feel like they were there just as an extra, something not necessary that tends to cause more annoyingness in the long run.\\nThe world or i should say, worlds, are very well crafted with unique beauty, each with its own charms, quirks, strategies.\\n\\nAt first i was put off by the game, maybe i was too accustomed to the previous game and was expecting the exact same thing. While there aren't major changes, there's some new UI stuff that might feel weird at first.\\nI'd say it has good hardware optimization overall. The game also works fine with a mouse but i'd really recommend you to play it with a controller, it's less confusing at times.\\n\\ntl;dr - Gameplay is solid, and you don't need to be a fan to enjoy it, you can have as little knowledge about this universe as you have of building a spaceship, and you will still get few dozen hours of fun out of it.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'As a huge fan of Shadow of Mordor, and the middle earth universe in general, I have been waiting 3 years for the sequel to SOM to come out, and whilst its not a bad game (I actually think its better than SOM), I don\\'t feel that I can recomend it, at least now, based of the large number of issues I have with the game.\\n\\n\\nFirst of I will start with the positives\\n\\n+ The game is much larger in scope than SOM with more areas to explore (Five in total, compared to SOM\\'s two)\\n\\n+ A much better loot system that replaces the runes of the last game. There is now armor and weapons.\\n\\n+ A better story, which feels more Lord of the rings than SOM\\'s story\\n\\n+ More varied orcs with new attack patterns and new olog-hai (trolls)\\n\\n+ Large fortress battles\\n\\n+ A few new skills and improvements to the SOM formula, like auto picking up arrows and double jump\\n\\n\\nNow sadly onto the negatives, and I have alot of them :(\\n\\n- The game is very buggy at the moment and as far as I am aware there has not been a single patch released for the game on PC (I am not 100% sure)\\nTwice have I failed fortress assaults because my character has glitched into the enviroment and I am unable to move.\\n\\n- The maps are actually smaller than the ones in SOM (but the total mass of all 5 maps is bigger than the 2 in SOM) and they just arn\\'t very memorable. Appart from the forts which vary a bit, 4 of the 5 maps are basically the same, with different skins over the top. There are pretty much no memorable locations on any of the maps except the Minas Morgul map.\\n\\n- The controls still feel clunky, and the gamepad controls have too many actions on too few buttons. For example, on an XB1 controller, A is to sprint, jump, climb jump, roll, volt over an enemy and a few more moves. This means that when you are in combat you end up doing the wrong moves, like trying to volt an enemy instead of dodging an attack. There are also too many enemies at once and its pretty much impossible to attack a certain one, the game will just attack anything it wants.\\n\\n- Far too many reused assets. As a huge AC fan, I am used to seeing alot of reused assets going from game to game, and I don\\'t have a problem with reusing assets, as long as there is enough new stuff to make it feel fresh. The problem is that this game doesn\\'t have enough. \\nThe combat animations are 95% the same as SOM, the background music and combat music has been copied over from SOM, one of the 5 regions of the game is in the same region as one of SOM\\'s maps with alot of reused textures and models.\\nAs someone who played SOM for over 200 hrs between PC and Xbox, I have to say this game starts to feel stale way to fast.\\n\\n- The end cutscene is hidden behind a grindwall. To access the real ending of the game you are forced to defend your fortresses 20 times in a mode called \"shadow wars\" at the end of the main story. After 2 or 3 assults it starts to get boring real fast, and every single attack feels pretty much the same. Since it\\'s the end of the game there is nothing left to do except repeat the fortress assaults, and when there are bugs like the ones mentioned above it really starts to piss you off.\\n\\n- The loot boxes. Like I said above the ending of the game feels purposely hidden behind a grind wall to make the player want to buy loot boxes. There are also adverts all over the main menu and the pause menu and even pop-ups on the army screen telling you to \"buy\" new orcs from the market.  \\n\\n- Poor optimisation on lower end PCs. My Rig is running a 1080Ti, so I have not experienced this one first hand. That said, many friends running lower ends cards, as well as other reviews I have read say that the game doesn\\'t run that great on lower end PC\\'s. I wasn\\'t going to add this since it hasn\\'t effected me, but I decided to just to keep people informed.\\n\\n- Alot of the orcs use the same dialogue, which was never an issue in SOM (for me), and it makes alot of the enemies you face feel the same as other enemies you have already killed. I have run into 7 orcs during my playthrough which all have the same story about how they were bitten by a spider and they all look the same, with the same orc character model with a spider web stuck to their faces.\\n\\n- The orcs talk too much during sieges, let me explain what I mean. \\nLike in SOM, every time you run into a named orc from the nemesis system, the gameplay will pause and the orc will talk to you for 10 - 20 seconds, usually saying something about how hes going to kill you and eat your face. The problem I have is that when you attack an enemy fortress there are usually 6 warchiefs in charge of the fort that you will have to kill. Each warchief usually has 2 bodyguards, which means there are about 18 nemesis enemies in total in every fort. Every time you run into one they will start to talk to you, and there is nothing you can do while they talk to you for 10 - 20 seconds, and there is no way to skip it. This means that during every fortress assult you have to listen to 18 orcs telling their boring stories about how they are going to kill you. This really ruins the pace of the assults as they are ment to be huge scale battles with tonnes of enemies to kill, and having the game pause once every few seconds as you run into another orc captain really ruins the pace. Simply adding a skip dialogue button would fix this problem and I don\\'t know why the devs havn\\'t done this.\\n\\nTo summarize, I don\\'t think this is a bad game. I even think this is a better game than SOM. But sadly the game has too many problems and not enough new things for me to recommend it at the £45 / $60 price tag. If the game is patched and some of the issues are fixed I might change my review to a positive, but as of now I honestly cannot recommend this game.\\n\\nIm sorry if this review comes across as very negative, but its because I had really high hopes for this game and I want to see it succeed. It just has too many problems for me right now :(',\n",

       "  'review': \"Shadow of War...man this game. I still remember that day, it was early in the morning, i woke up early that day because it was the first day of high school. I was searching my YouTube for videos to see when the trailer of the game appeared in front of me. I clicked it because i had already played Shadow of Mordor and knew the series. I was blasted away, i then watched more and more videos, clips from the story from the gameplay i didn't care. I was hyped up. In that moment, i decided... I wanted to play this game so god damn much, but at the time i didn't have the pc to support the game. I waited for 2 long years when at last on December 2019 i bought a new pc, and guess what game i bought and played first. Yep, Middle Earth Shadow of War. My favourite duo Celembrimbor and Talion were back to kick some ass. Oh boy the new and updated Nemesis system was just amazing. I kept playing the game for months on end i completed everything including all dlcs and achievements. 100% completion. Then for dozen more hours i was just wondering around the regions of Mordor killing everything in my path. I had so much fun with the orcs and their unique personalities. I want to replay it on Gravewalker difficulty. Yes I'm a masochist. I recommend it with closed eyes. Buy It.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So torn on this game. I loved it maybe 75% of the way through..once you reach the last act though it\\'s just the worst grind of a game with an incredibly unsatisfying ending.\\n\\nEverything written here is of my own opinion. Take it for what it is\\n\\nGameplay: The gameplay is great...for awhile. If you\\'ve played the first one, then you already know the Nemesis system is great and makes combat fluid. The only problem is now there\\'s just so many enemies on screen at one time it can be kind of craz and you might get blindsided/execute the wrong enemy. Just a little thing. In regards to the enemies, they get old fast. There are maybe 5 variations? And after the first 10 hours or so...the speeches that they give before they fight you are super annoying and unnecessary. Wish they would have added a skip option. \\nTowards the latter half, it is a grind of a game. And that\\'s not a bad thing, I love to grind out games and build up the character. But it didn\\'t feel fun after a while, even the side quests themselves felt boring and derivative.\\n\\nGraphics/Visuals: Game looks great, can\\'t complain.\\n\\nStory: Torn here as well. I loved the LOTR movies, and was excited to hear that they would be bringing back Talion and the lore for a 2nd run. The only problem is, by the 4th act they really dropped the ball. I won\\'t spoil it, but it just felt so unsatisfying as a resolution. It felt like they just rushed through it, through together a final act, added a HUGE grinding section of a game that can take HOURS to complete. and i mean HOURS. all to really just see this last scene and...you\\'re just left wondering \"...THAT\\'S the ending?\" Save yourself the trouble: stop playing after the end of Act III, and just watch the ending on YouTube. I honestly didn\\'t even finish the game after i realized what the end-game was. They REALLY want you to buy lootboxes...and while it isn\\'t necessary, it\\'s just annoying how much weight they put on the micro-transactions\\n\\nStarted out loving this game, now i can\\'t recommend it to another person for FULL price. if it\\'s on sale, then go for it. But i would definitely not pay full price like i did knowing what  i do now.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Man, this game is a mixed bag. If you’re expecting a game with even a shred of narrative decency, you’ll be sorely disappointed with what is essentially collectable orc Pokemon. The story is a garbage fire, the characters are as compelling as a bowl of lumpy rocks, and the progression system is entirely arbitrary. The real heart of Shadow of War is the orcs; dynamically generated characters who are absolutely bursting with personality. If not for them, Shadow of War would be an unbearable slog of poorly constructed narrative scraps which would make Tolkien roll over in his grave.\\n\\n[b]Characters and Story[/b]\\n\\nLike I mentioned above, the story is an absolute waste of time. I dreaded every single one of the mandatory and nonsensical story missions. For anyone who missed the last game, Shadow of Mordor ended with the sequel bait of building your army to confront the Dark Lord in Mordor, and this is exactly where Shadow of War picks up. Unfortunately, SoW addresses this mandate in the worst conceivable way. \\n\\nIn order to fight Sauron, Celebrimbor decides to craft a new ring of power. This is alright I guess, though the exact attributes of this ring are never fully discussed. I guess it just does what the normal ring does with the exception of being ‘less evil’. Naturally Talion/Celebrimbor immediately lose the ring to the new sexy shapeshifting Shelob, the giant fucking spider from the main Lord of the Rings Trilogy who apparently can magically teleport the wraith of Celebrimbor around for some reason. How can she do this? Who cares - look at those tits! She yoinks the ring and presumably just stares at it for a while before giving it back to Talion (all you have to do is ask for her to pretty please return it!). This introduction pretty much sets the standard for the rest of the game. Nothing makes any sense, nothing is explained, and there’s absolutely no narrative tension. \\n\\nI think the following interaction sums up the quality of the story pretty well. It happens just after entering the second act. Talion hears some funky noises coming from the forest and asks whats up. Celebrimbor explains that he’s hearing the forest of Carnan, and that Talion should just ignore it and keep branding orcs. Of course, you immediately head on over-\\n\\nCelebrimbor: “Yo Talion, don’t mess with the Spirit of Carnan. She’s an ancient protector of the forest who’s already pissed that orcs are using her pals as firewood. How about you just try and be nice for like 30 seconds.”\\n\\nTalion: “I bow to no vegetation.”\\n\\n*Proceeds to chop up non-hostile tree elementals for literally no reason*\\n\\nThis pretty much sums up the Celebrimbor-Talion relationship throughout the whole game. Celebrimbor says something that makes sense, Talion does the exact opposite. It’s as if Talion has the IQ of a piece of french toast (though the french toast probably has more personality). His character truly is insufferable - he’s either droning on about “the people of Gondor” or preaching shitty little monologues about “building an army” and saving the world. Absolutely no characterization here; I wish we could have played as wraith dad. \\n\\nThe other good characters are mostly just as bad. There’s an elf lady who does strong independent elf things, a sad soldier from Minas Ithil with abandonment problems, and an African-American gentlemen who just kind of pops in sometimes. Gollum also makes an obligatory appearance for a little while. Development is lacking overall.\\n\\nSome of the cutscenes are also very poorly done. I remember an instance early on when African-American gentlemen, Talion, and a group of Gondorian soldiers were to ambush a captain near a fighting pit. Besides the whole area being mysteriously devoid of orcs when the area was swarming with them just a few seconds before, the camera work was just awful. You get a close up shot of the captain and right behind him is a dude from Gondor, bow fully strung and aiming at the ambush point. What the heck WB? Things like this are very immersion breaking throughout the game.\\n\\n[b]Combat and Progression[/b]\\n\\nBasically Assassins Creed on crack. Pretty fun, no complaints here. This game lets you ride drakes. \\n\\nSkill progression is smooth and and doesn’t require a great deal of effort. I had almost everything unlocked before ending the second act. Their are some fun Celebrimbor lore challenges throughout the world where you relive (?) the wraith's past, but these don’t really give you much advantage other than a few gems and a skill point. There are also collectables dotted throughout the world which let you access lore on Shelob or open certain doors, but these are all optional. \\n\\nShadow of War also lets you equip armor and weapons for Talion, but this mostly consists of wearing a piece of gear for a little bit and then chucking it once a better piece pops up. Nothing really memorable here.\\n\\n[b]The Orcs[/b]\\n\\nThis is the main selling point for Shadow of War. Across the board orcs are fantastic. The nemesis system is vastly improved from the first game, allowing you to forge more meaningful stories with your own randomly generated orc buds. It’s a rollercoaster of emotions to watch your favorite brain damaged Olog with a flaming club lose a fight to some skinny dude with an explosive crossbow. The only thing that kept me playing this game is an unstoppable urge to brand all the Pokem- I mean captains in the area and see their quirky personalities. Much has been said about the dreaded fourth act, but if you’re down for branding orcs for an eternity it’s not so bad. Building and conquering fortresses is great, and it's really fun to watch your hard earned orc children blossom into warlords of their own. Generally a great experience in the orc department.\\n\\n[b]Loot Boxes[/b]\\n\\nThey exist, but why would you buy them if the most fun part of the game is collecting orcs? It’s like paying to be sad. \\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\n\\nPick up Shadow of War on sale for 30 bucks in 2018. The orcs are great and the combat is fun, but the narrative hernia is a real bummer. Come for the orcs, stay for the orcs. On the off chance orcs aren’t your jam, don’t buy this game.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Alright, this game has a special place in my heart, it is probably the single most addicting and satisfying game i have ever played. cutting your way through Mordor 1 captain at a time has never felt better. i have come back to this game countless times for more, in fact, i'm re-installing it to do so as i write this. on sale or not, this game is worth every cent, no doubt. so i'll end this with a story i fondly remember that could only really be experienced in this game\\n\\nI had an orc named Gund Giggles, he wasn't the brightest, but he had a funny name, so i liked him regardless. after a long conquest of a fort with him helping me all the way, he was promoted to overlord of said fort after. Unfortunately, his position was short-lived and was killed in a defense not to long after by a Olog i don't remember the name of. losing him made me reasonably upset so i tried to track the bastard down and after 15 minutes i found him and engaged, but he was resistant to all my powerful tools, and killed me as well, but to add insult to injury, he BROKE MY GODDAMN SWORD. from this point i went from upset to pissed, he took my favorite orc, and now my best weapon too. i came back with a not as good, but still formidable sword to do it again, and keeping in mind his weaknesses, i took him down on my second try, recovering my sword, which was now reforged to the highest possible level, and avenging my best orc.\\n\\nExperiences like these are what make this game unique, and i HIGHLY suggest you play this game yourself.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Middle-Earth: Shadow of War is a sequel to 2014's Shadow of Mordor. Initially criticized by its heavy MTX format, Shadow of War developers have removed every form of microtransactions from the game (while still keeping loot boxes than can be acquired completing online, optional missions). Briefing finished, let's go to the review.\\n\\n[h1]Technical Aspects[/h1]\\n\\nMiddle-Earth: Shadow of War runs in 'Firebird', an expansion of the LithTech Jupiter EX from the previous game, and just like it, [b]it's a really scalable engine[/b]. Shadow of War runs very well and has a great number of graphical options, including a resolution scaler based on the desired FPS target (30 - 144). Overall, SoW doesn't look like a console port at all, and it does a great job as a benchmarking title for your new build. I ran it in 3 configurations: GTX 780Ti + i5 6600K, Ryzen 3 2200G (with its iGPU, OC'd to 1500MHz) and a Ryzen 1200 + RX460 4GB, [b]all of them were able to achieve a steady framerate with decent looking graphics, including the R2200G and its iGPU[/b]. I feel however that Shadow of War has issues with RAM management. Often, after long-playing times you could see some stutters and RAM numbers going wild, but given that it's an open-world game, with larger areas loading periodically, that's somewhat expected - I'd really recommend that players with 8GB or less to restart the game after 2 to 3 hours, it will make for a much more enjoyable experience.\\n\\nShadow of War is a beautiful game, especially in Núrnen, its second region. If you have some bandwidth to expend, you can also download HD texture pack and a 4K cutscenes packs to make your experience even better. If you don't, be ready to see some bad looking textures every here and there in minor locations, but overall, it still is a good looking game.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\n\\nShadow of War expands on the gameplay of its predecessor by allowing you to take control of orcs and building an army while invading and defending forts, offline and online. Of course, that's not the only change. \\n\\nIn the combat aspect, [b]SoW now encourage different character builds and play styles[/b]. Also expanding from SoM, close to its end, the game doesn't turn to be too easy as online challenges and the enemies generated by the Nemesis system [b]will level up along you[/b], so while most Orcs will be easier once you reach level 40, 45, you will still be challenged every now and then. Now, talking about the combat in itself - [b]its smooth and works, but it surely gets repetitive, especially when it comes to animations[/b]. There's about 5 animations for finishers, 5 for stealth attacks and 5 for brutalizing enemies; Monolith could've improved this by doubling this number because when you see all those five variations for the 100th time (and that will happen sooner than you'd expect) they won't be the same and the combat will stagnate. [b]Of course, SoW allows multiple approaches - instead of battling entire armies to reach a captain or a warchief, you can just bring him over to you with the right Archer upgrades[/b]. Or maybe if you prefer to use wild beasts to conquer the warzone, you can also focus in the Hunter skill-tree that allows you to summon beasts like Caragors and Graugs. \\n\\nAlso, [b]I can't go without mentioning the revamped domination system[/b]. Just like in Shadow of Mordor, you can take control of enemies in the middle of the combat and they will fight for you. This time however, you can also dominate captains, recruit them or shame them. Recruiting them will insert them in your army to fight for you and from there you can order them to kill other captains or upgrade them using coins that you get from killing enemies and completing missions.\\n\\nExploring the open-world is also pretty smooth but not without its flaws. Sometimes, especially when there's a large number of enemies in the screen all rounding you, the system to target enemies have a priority list that doesn't always work in the way that the player wish and sometimes, while jumping in a fight you can end doing the wrong thing as there's a wide-array of commands assigned to a limited number of keys.\\n\\nJust like its predecessor, SoW allows the player to travel through a Caragor (a lion-horse like creature), Graugs (giants) and a new addition to the roster are Drakes, flying creatures that can spit fire. For travelling using those, you will need to invest in the Hunter skill-tree so if you're like me, that is okay walking around on foot, it's completely skippable. I myself found mounting to be too messy to control and skipped it.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nShadow of War story continues from where SoM ended. [b]Celebrimbor forged a new ring and [b]he and Talion knows that it's time to fight Sauron[/b]. Sooner than later, it comes clear that they will need to build an army to fight Sauron's own army and your adventure starts from there. [b]The game has four subsets of main-quest missions - Bruz', Carnán's, Gondor's and the main ones)[/b][/b]. All of them rewards in exclusive skill unlocks for one of the skill-trees and I do recommend completing all of them before heading to the final missions, they provide a lot of XP and can make the online missions much more enjoyable.\\n\\nNow, for the story itself it is, well, mediocre, until the last mission. [b]Most characters are completely forgettable, Ratbag is back, sure, but you see him in two or three missions and he goes dark once again, and so does Gollum[/b]. Bruz is quite a funny guy and probably the best character after Talion and Celebrimbor and that's it. Idril's story is one of the worst I saw in recent times and Baranor is plain boring. [b]The way that the game works with them is not really ideal[/b]. \\n\\nAs stated above, Shadow of War, in my opinion had a good ending. I saw people calling it unfair and disappointing and that is understandable. The true ending is locked through a very hard and not that intuitive mini-game that takes hours to complete and before getting the ending you get might not be seen as I did by some players [b]that had a different vision on Talion and Celebrimbor tale[/b]. \\n\\n[h1]Nemesis System:[/h1]\\n[quote=IGN]In Middle-earth: Shadow of War, the Nemesis System is the structure that Monolith has built that generates endless possibilities for the enemies you will face, the way they will act, and the stories that will grow as they face you again and again.[/quote]\\n\\n[b]The Nemesis system was impressive in Shadow of Mordor and it's even more impressive here[/b]. There's brothers who will avenge their siblings, orcs will have different classes and different backgrounds, and they will betray each other or fight between themselves in their lust for power. [b]Your followers will bring gifts to you in form of captured orcs that have information regarding enemies or they will get tired of you and will betray[/b]. \\n\\nAnd this is where the Nemesis missions enters. Now, captains will be doing duels between themselves, training gangs of orcs or hunting beasts in the wild. You can help them in their tasks so they can increase their levels or catch them when they have their hands full fighting against the world. \\n\\nWhile you may see orcs that look close to others between regions, they will have differences, even if really small ones. Maybe they're specialized in using venom instead of fire weapons, or maybe they will be invulnerable to stealth instead of invulnerable to arrows (or maybe both). It's interesting to see what the Nemesis system keep generating, especially in online where other people orcs can be transferred to your game by dominating them there and bringing them as captains to one of your fortresses. \\n\\n[b]SCORE:[/b] 9.0/10 - SoW is fun, big, and the Nemesis system along the online iterations makes up for a great game. It has its flaws, and the gameplay could've been expanded further. Nonetheless, Shadow of War is a must-play, I don't know nothing about LoTR, but I enjoyed to see Talion's tale coming to an end.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b]UPDATE:\\nWB and Monolith have removed pay to win elements from this game, including lootboxes. I shall keep this review negative however, as a lesson to Publishers and Devs alike that this kind of behavior will not be tolerated.[/b]\\n\\n\\n[h1]Tl\\'dr version: [/h1]\\n\\n[b]An amazing improvement upon the original, completely contaminated by some of the worst industry practices we have yet seen. Make no mistake, if the consumer base does not stop this now, we will be seeing not only microtransactions in $60 games but further degradation of the base game for them to wring every last ounce of money from us. DO NOT BUY THE LOOTBOXES.[/b]\\n\\nYou can follow me, and see the rest of my work here:\\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/StarSide/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\\n\\n[h1]Elaborated version:[/h1]\\n\\nMaybe from that you can already tell I will not just be talking about the base-game of Shadow of War for the whole review. Most reviewers policy is to separate industry practices from the game to judge the game \"on its own merits\". Well, here\\'s my issues with that. If you are compromising the product on purpose, in order to drag the game out, or purposely tear the game apart in order for you sell us content later down the line, that is most definitely an already compromised (ethically and mechanically) product. \\n\\nIf WB had kept their grubby mitts of this game, I would most definitely have given this a positive review. However, since that is not what they have done, this review will remain negative. \\n\\n[b]Microtransactions.[/b]\\n\\nSome in-depth analysis here. Firstly, the infamous loot box situation. You can buy orks from loots boxes, not just getting them out in the in-game world. This completely breaks in-game immersion and the economy of the game. You can either choose to ignore the loot boxes and go at it vanilla, where you\\'re missing out on possible high-level minions, as the game was obviously intended, as the level of orks you find are introduced on a gradient; the higher level you are, the better orks you will find. Additionally, what are essentially ads for the lootboxes keep popping up in game, where you are prompted to go and buy them. Also, if you want any hope of being \\'competitive\\' in the online game mode Shadow Wars, you\\'ll need some super powerful orks, something the lootboxes have the slight possibility to help with. \\n\\nConsequently, you will notice every dynamic in the game becomes centered around these things in some form of another:\\n\\nYou want an high level ork? Cough up! \\nYou want to upgrade your weapons and armor? You\\'ll need additional gems to do that, cough up!\\nYou want to play multiplayer? Better have some good orks, so cough up!!\\n\\nWhether the game would have been constructed like this without the cancer that is WarnerBrothers getting their claws into the mechanics of the game is completely moot. \\n\\nNow, with that out of the way, let\\'s talk about the game.\\n\\n[b]Story.[/b]\\n\\nYou a lord of the rings lore fan? This is going to be a rough ride. \\nThe game, for better or for worse, plays fast and lose with the canon to such an extent you wonder why not just set this in the time of the silmerilian and call it a day. However, if you can get past the desecration of established law (which I can), the story is actually quite compelling. \\n\\nFollowing on the last game, Ranger Talion and his ancient dead elf-friendo Calimbrimbor have made a new ring of power, just like Saurons. Great! What could go wrong. Turns out quite a lot actually. What follows is an epic, continent spanning war between the \\'Bright Lord\\' and Sauron. All sorts of shenanigans ensue! Just don\\'t get too disappointed if you were expecting high-brow Shakespeare. \\n\\n\\n[b]Movement and Combat.[/b]\\n\\nLike Shadows of Mordor but better. Everything is back from the last game, but with added upppf. Movement is buttery smooth, and really the game plays just like every other third-person openworld, Arkyum style game. Speaking of which, the combat system is straight outta Batman, which isn\\'t a bad thing. \\nCombat is fun and Talion\\'s wraith powers are suitably beefed up from the last game. \\n\\n[b]The Nemesis system.[/b]\\nI was going to add this to the last section however, it more or less is one of the most original ideas in the last decade in gaming. Essentially, the Nemesis system allows every individual ork to remember you, and everything you\\'ve done to them. Burn that ork captain in a fire, he might come for you later on. This is extended to the \\'meta game\\' aspect for creating armies. Your generals might betray you, or save your life. This creates some of the best dynamic stories in gaming really. However, sometimes the betrayals get a little too common, and you\\'ll find yourself trying to game the system in order to keep your orks on your side. \\nI won\\'t say anything more, it really is something better to experience for yourself. \\n\\n[b]Sound.[/b]\\nNot the best, not the worst. Voice acting is passable, with a few exceptions. Talion seems mostly asleep during his cutscenes, the voice actor is clearly phoning it in for his paycheck at this point. On the other hand, Calimbrimbor is the star of the show. His gravely tones are both charismatic and slightly scary, especially when he gets all shouty. \\nCombat noises are also quite good. Swords ring and the screams of orks will pervade your ears constantly. In this universe, all orks seem to have a slightly comical British cocny accent. You\\'ll either love it or hate it. \\n\\n\\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\\nNot concentrating on the poor industry behavior, this is a great game. However, I will not simply segregate them out of the review, because this stuff definitely effects the end product. Great game! But make a statement and wait for this to get to a low price. And DON\\'T, DON\\'T, DON\\'T buy those damn lootboxes!!',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have about 72hrs logged in SOM and I love that game. I have really been looking forward to SOW with many new features. I have to note that I have not completely finished the game because the ending cinematic is hidden behind a grind that is just not worth it for me. The last stage is fortress sieges over and over and over again... I would have understood defending each of your fortresses once, but the way it's designed is very grindy and boring. I quit after finishing stage 6 of the Shadow Wars. This just seems like a way to push you towards the micro-transactions, which I hate in a single player game. I have not accepted the EULA for the marketplace during my entire play-through and the game really tried to push me into it with many warnings and notifications.\\n\\nPROS\\n+ Better loot system\\n+ Armor customization and looks\\n+ Skill system\\n+ New enemy type (olog-hai)\\n+ New captain types and encounters (singers, ambushers, blood brothers...)\\n+ I have not experienced any crashes (opposed to what other players are experiencing)\\n\\nCONS\\n- Controls are sometimes inconsistent (especially the double jump distance seems to be very varied)\\n- The armor and weapons you wear does not appear in the cut scenes (it always reverts to the default armor)\\n- There are very little new animations and models (gets repetitive very soon)\\n- The micro-transactions / loot boxes\\n- The same dialogues from orcs (which can fortunately be disabled)\\n- The Shadow Wars stage grind for the ending cinematic is way too long and in my opinion not worth it\\n\\nIn conclusion SOW is not a bad game, it just doesn't bring enough new features like SOM did. I will not even be finishing the Shadow Wars stage and rather watch the ending cinematic on youtube. The Shadow Wars stage seems like a wall put in the game just to force you to use micros-transactions.\\n\\nI can not recommend it for the full price, just wait for some sale or until it gets to the price of SOM (GOTY edition can be had for ~5€).\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It's effectively more of the same. If you like SOM, you'll like SOW. The sequel has all you'd expect from a successor; better graphics, new abilities, improved gameplay etc. If you're a newcomer but familar with Assassin's Creed, then simply think of that but with a Lord Of The Rings reskin. If you're not familar with either the first game or the Assassin's Creed franchise, then for around £30 I recommend picking this game up. It's a little bit of an open world / sandbox.\\n\\nThose are it's good points. Time for the bad.\\n\\n- The story isn't exactly something that'll blow you away. Not terrible, but clearly there to weed you through learning different combat mechanics, learning new abilities etc.\\n\\n- It's very repetitive. Fortunately the combat is slick with enough variety to try out a few things or simply enjoy the spectacle, but it all boils down to run here...kill orcs...rinse, repeat.\\n\\n- The controls can be very sluggish. You stick like glue to practically everything, and sometimes you may want to jump one way but end up somewhere else or crawling a wall or GRRR. Also, using the mouse slider by default to allow you to sprint faster is a poor design decision because A) Not everyone has a (functioning) mouse slider, and B) Not everyone has one of the mouse sliders where you can just let it continue rolling after pressing down a button. It looks clunky repeatedly having to flick it up to move at a decent enough speed.\\n\\n- It's grindy. Not too bad in the early stages but you can see why they introduced...\\n\\n- Lootboxes. They have no place in a single-player only game. I'm not as up-in-arms as most peope are about microtransactions as they do have their place in the industry (IE. Free-To-Play games and / or cosmetics only), but for this game their implementation is wholly inappropriate.\\n\\nFor that point, and that last point ONLY, I'm rating the game a thumbs down. Not because it's bad (IT ISN'T), but simply because I can't condone a business practice that is hostile towards customers.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Middle Earth: Shadow of War is the sequel to Shadow of Mordor, my favourite game of 2014, which was set in the world of Lord of the Rings, and combined the Batman Arkham style third person combat with an innovative Nemesis system used to create interesting unique orcs to fight against. This sequel is pretty much the same game, but on a larger scale. The player once again controls Talion, the undead ranger of Gondor, who is being kept alive by the ghost of the Elf Celebrimbor, to continue fighting against the armies of Sauron and Mordor.\\n\\nTalion has a wide range of abilities available to use during combat. In addition to basic sword and bow attacks, and moves like dodge and counter, he has a rage meter which builds up by dealing damage. When full, you can either perform an execution, which will instantly kill a basic orc, or deal high damage to an orc captain, or you can use an energy blast which is an area of effect attack that can be upgraded to deal fire or poison damage. Shadow Strike allows you to aim your bow but instead of firing an arrow, you can teleport to that location and melee kill an orc – also useful for getting yourself out of danger when surrounded by enemies. You can shoot campfires to cause an explosion, and can shoot an enemy in the foot to pin them to the ground and prevent them moving for a short time. You can chain multiple stealth kills together. You can dominate orcs and force them to fight for you. And you can dominate wild animals – caragors, graugs and drakes, and ride them into battle.\\n\\nThere are two types of orc to fight against. Basic grunts can be equipped with a sword or club, bow, spear and shield, dual wield axes, and some ride their own caragor, but all are weak and die from a few hits. Captains level up over time, have much more health, and several strengths and weaknesses which you can identify by extracting intel from grunts. They could be immune from, scared of, enraged by, or killed instantly by any kind of attack, including stealth, headshots, fire or poison. They might wield their own fire or poison weapon, and could be protected by a gang of orc bodyguards. Figuring out how to take advantage of their weaknesses adds a tactical element to the combat.\\n\\nYou can collect loot from killed captains, in the form of better armour and weapons that have special properties which will influence your playing style. For example you could have a percentage chance to regain health or do fire/poison damage on critical hits, or you could regain bow ammo from stealth kills or headshots.\\n\\nWhen a captain is low on health, they can be mind controlled and forced to join your army. You can assign them as your bodyguard and summon them to fight alongside you. Or you could send them on missions to kill other enemy orcs. If you dominate a captain who is the bodyguard of a war chief, you can turn them into a spy, and then when you attack the war chief, the spy will betray their former master and help you kill them. However, dominated orcs can also betray the player, especially if you attack their blood brother.\\n\\nCaptains have alot of personality, and they’ll talk to you before a fight, threatening to kill you, or taunting you if they’ve already succeeded in a previous fight. I recruited one who was “mindless”, he only had a single line of dialogue, and everywhere he went he just kept saying “I don’t know. I don’t know”. I also fought against a couple of bards, who sang every line of dialogue like a song. However, over the course of the game you have to fight dozens, possibly hundreds of captains, so eventually I forgot which ones I had a personal history with.\\n\\nCombat quickly becomes chaotic in a good way. You’ll often enter a mission intending to kill a specific captain, only to notice there\\'s a second captain nearby, plus a few grunts. Partway through the fight, a third captain might join the fight. Eventually you’ll kill one, maybe dominate another and command him to stay and help you. By now you’re getting low on health. Suddenly a fourth captain appears with some caragors and a few more grunts, and this same fight that started about five minutes ago just keeps on going until you either retreat or get killed.\\n\\nTalion effectively has infinite lives, because Celebrimbor will keep resurrecting him, however dying does have negative consequences. Orc captains will level up and gain new abilities, which makes the next fight against them more difficult, and new captains will appear to replace the ones you\\'ve killed. When near death you can perform a last chance QTE to stay alive, unless the enemy orc has the \"no last chance\" ability. Sometimes your own orcs will appear at the last moment to save your life by killing your enemy just before they deliver your deathblow.\\n\\nThe story is pretty good, as you carry out missions to help the soldiers of Gondor, and an Elven assassin called Eltariel fight the Nazgul. Voice acting is mostly good, especially from Troy Baker as Talion and Laura Bailey as Eltariel.\\n\\nA large part of the game involves building your army of orcs to assault fortresses in five open world areas. The ultimate goal is to kill the orc overlord who commands the fortress, and take ownership of the fortress. Before that, its a good idea to kill or dominate the war chiefs who defend the fortress to make the final siege mission easier. And before that you’ll probably want to kill or dominate the war chiefs’ bodyguard captains. It took me 38 hours to complete the game, but during the last few hours the fortress capturing did start to feel repetitive. Especially in the final chapter when Sauron attempts to recapture your fortresses. If you lose the siege defence missions – which are really difficult because the game throws lots of really high level orcs at you – you’ll then have to spend another hour working through the whole captain/war chief/overlord hierarchy again to re-recapture the fortress.\\n\\nOther minor complaints include the fact that when you’ve captured a fortress, the surrounding area is still filled with enemy orcs. Although you’ll see a few friendly orcs too, I didn’t feel like I’d actually made the area safer. I quickly got bored of fighting grunts in the open world, so I just ran past them to the next quest location. Riding drakes sounds cool, but unfortunately the control scheme during flight is terrible, feels slow and unresponsive and this ruins what should have been an epic fight against a powerful enemy. And in another mission, I actually dismounted the drake because it was easier to kill orcs with my bow. \\n\\nWhile moving around the open world, the parkour controls can occasionally be a bit weird. I sometimes wanted to jump off a roof onto another ledge, but for some reason Talion would jump in a completely different direction to what I was pressing. This can be annoying when you’re trying to be stealthy but you unexpectedly land next to a bunch of orcs. I also noticed that Talion has a problem realising that you want to climb a thin pole and he’ll decide to jump past it, and he really struggles to climb through windows, instead choosing to climb up the wall around the window.\\n\\nWith the exception of these minor flaws, I didn’t suffer from any bugs or crashes, I was able to maintain a constant 60 FPS and I played with my xbox 360 controller which worked great during combat.\\n\\nShadow of War is a good game, and I recommend picking it up, especially if you’re a fan of Lord of the Rings. I waited almost a year to play it because of the controversy surrounding the inclusion of microtransactions at release. These have now been removed from the game, and the progression of levelling up Talion and his orc army felt fine to me.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I never really bothered to write a review for this game, mostly because everyone and their grandma has heard of it. But I do have a few things i want to say.\\n\\nFirst of all, I can\\'t really say anything about the game that nobody has said before, but go ahead and look at my playtime. I don\\'t think I would put this much time in a game I hated. I feel like that says a lot. If you want a long, detailed review, there are lots you can find. I personally liked Angry Joe Show\\'s review of the game.\\n\\nSecond, this game was released October 9th, 2017. Today, on July 17th, 2018, there was a free update released to the main game, which includes but is not limited to:\\n-The removal of it\\'s microtransactions, after public complaints and the stunt that EA pulled with Battlefront 2.\\n-Bug Fixes\\n-Balancing\\n-Makes the Last Act of the game far less tedious and repetitive\\n-And probably more that I can\\'t think of.\\nRegardless of their reasoning behind it, even if it\\'s just PR, the fact that there have people listening to the complaints and addressing them up until this point, and potentially more in the future? That\\'s really cool. So really, many of the problems that people have had with the game in the past are now fixed or lessened.\\n\\nThird, if you get the game, I highly recommend you get the \"Blade of Galadriel\" and \"Desolation of Mordor\" DLCs at some point. I personally did not get the Tribe dlcs and it seems to me like a waste of money, so I would recommend you stay away from that, but I can\\'t stop you if you want to.\\n\\nSo yeah. It\\'s a cool game. I felt like writing this. If you think \"Hey, this game looks pretty cool\", that\\'s because it is. It\\'s good.',\n",

I rushed to revive him, but in the fevered pitch of battle I too was slain- my dying vision clouded by that singular orc, Mozu.\\n\\nMozu took a mount after the battle, and a new name- Mozu the Shadow. As he was a recent recruit to the captains, and he looked to lead mounts, I thought he might make a good recruit. I interrogated some of his own to learn that he was terrified of Morgai Flies. I infiltrated a feast of his, and managed to capture a rival of my own to fight on my side- another giant. After I ambushed Mozu, I dropped a nest of the flies on his head, causing him to quake with horror and flee. I tried to give chase, but neither luck nor haste was with me. Frustrated, I ordered the large orc I had convinced to defect, Ur-Lasu, on an assassination to finish Mozu off.\\n\\nI next met Mozu on that very assassination- I wanted to tip the scales. Mozu was different now, though- he still rode his carragor, but his flesh was riddled with boils, and his face was overtaken by a hideous hive. He was no longer Mozu the Shadow- he was now Mozu of the Flies. The flies I had dropped on him previously had infested him, and his fear of them was now absent. As well, his weapons dripped with poison from the flies- which I did not anticipate. His orcs overtook me, and with a well-placed throwing axe, He felled me.\\n\\nThis led to a promotion- he was now warchief. I noted, though, that he had a weakness- his blood-brother, Hork. Hork had also been there at the siege, and had clashed with me for some time- but I shamed him and let him go. Hork had his mind broken by me and his body abused, but I offered to make amends- the price of which was his blood-brother Mozu's skull.\\n\\nI then set out to cull Mozu's remaining allies, his two other bodyguards. I sent Ur-Lasu to kill his bodyguards, and with my help the deeds were done- two more captains came to the slaughter, and only joined the mincemeat. Enraged, Mozu showed himself- mounted on his Carragor, and speaking plain that the vendetta was no longer about power- it was something more personal. \\n\\nA thug that Mozu had brought with him murdered my bodyguard in the insuing melee- Mozu's poison had left me to retreat and leave him to the mercy of the thug. His life bought time- time enough for a swift revenge against the giant. His advantage lost, Mozu fled.\\n\\nMozu then set a trap for me- not knowing that he was the one in danger. When I came to the trap, I remembered something- how Mozu had changed over the long campaign of assassinations I had waged against him. So, I used one of his own tactics against him. When he and his men charged me, I fled. From the rafters, baileys and merlons, I lept again and again into him, peppering him with stealth attacks- before finally hitting him with a fatal execution.\\n\\nIn his dying moments, he turned to me and swore that his death meant little- for his blood brother would avenge him. Moments later, he was cut to ribbons- never knowing that his blood brother Hork not only would not avenge him- but had led to his demise.\\n\\nHis brother did end up rebelling- but his death was swift.\\n\\nAnd this was the end of his story. Had he not cheated death.\\n\\nMozu, cheating death, jumped me after I assassinated a Ulug- in my weakened state, he finished me off, and taunted me in his moment of vengeance for slaying Hork.\\n\\nI wasn't pleased to learn of Mozu's return, so I sent an Ulug to kill him, and joined in on the ambush. When I came to it- it was he that ambushed me. However- I was not the same ranger he had terrorized before, and he was less of the orc that had done such terror. The battle was quick and painful- and he fell quickly. When I finally finished him off, I felt- sad. But hoped that Mozu's legacy would finally rest- a lowly orc that had achieved so much so fast, fueled only by our mutual spite.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Remark prior to reading:\\n- I do not care for the hype- nor the hate-train. I judge as I usually judge: based on nothing but my own opinion.\\n\\nI didn\\'t pre-order and kept my distance from this one until my favourite Reviewer (Gamestar) finally convinced me, and I\\'m with them 100%.\\n\\nI really liked \"Shadows of Mordor\" except his many shortcomings. And I\\'m not even a big Tolkien or Lord of the Rings-Fan. So I\\'m speaking purely gameplay-wise.\\nBut Mordor left me \"meh!\" after like 10 hours. Those 10 hours were great, but after that it just went boring and repetitive. \\nThe usual problem of the usual Ubisoft-\"Formula\" of totally uninspired \"map-clearing\".\\n\\nBut with \"Shadows of War\" they really removed those shortcomings. Mostly. I would have bet they relied on former success and just go for a quick cash-grab.\\nEvery Meter (or foot) you\\'d take, there\\'s something to do. And most often not just for the sake of having something to do, but for skill-points, \\nspecial skills or story or just moneyyyzzz.\\nAnd \"recruiting\" Captains to join your army, assigning them jobs, helping them complete missions, slowly raising your force to wage war in a region and all that is really motivating. And overall a damn fun to do!\\n\\nBut beside all the shining glory there\\'s an UGH! behind it:\\nLoot-Boxes. Yes. Sucks. They should be quartered, hanged and burned for that. But who can blame them. I guess those boxes alone are flushing\\nat least a Million bucks into their cash-registers. So who wouldn\\'t tread that path? (Except CD Project Red who simply did it with pure excellence)\\n*BUT* they are really not needed if you enjoy the game for the gameplay and not just for rushing through the story. The \"Endgame\" will be\\nhidden behind a \"grind\" (which is good if you actually enjoy the game, or else...why play it?) or a paywall. Legendary Orks will help, yes.\\nBut finding them is the thrill. Just buying them. Meh. Probably gets boring very fast.\\nNormal loot-boxes with items or Orks up to Epic (one level below Legendary) are buyable with ingame-currency which is not hard to come by.\\nAnd if you\\'re OK with that, you can even cheat your money and edit your Orks. IF you are ok with that and are in a rush.\\n\\n\\n(I only fear that these not-really-super-needed-loot-boxes are just slowly a test for our stupidity and will increase in necessity with every game. Let\\'s hope not)\\n\\n\\n(!) SIDE-NOTE: If you really don\\'t want loot-boxes or any online-content at all in your SINGLE-PLAYER-game, then simply decline\\nthe TOS the FIRST(!) time you start the game (it\\'s bound to your account and you cannot change it later!). You then have the total and complete\\nsingle-player-experience. No boxes, no revenges, no invasions.\\n\\n\\n[u]The good (what to love):[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*] Something to do whereever you go. And on top of it are weekly challenges and Vendettas (IF you accept the TOS)\\n[*] This game is flooded, literally, with Orks. Rarely you just see a handful. There are TONS OF THEM. \\n[*] Many skills with many modifiers to pick. Some hidden behind a level, some behind a quest, some behind collectibles.\\n[*] Collectibles are actually useful to collect and provide nice boni. Not just to stretch time.\\n[*] Much options in the menu. Tweak the game to your rig. Even got adaptive resolution scaling to provide constant FPS at the cost of resolution. GREAT!\\n[*] Well thought out keyboard-usage and fitting on-screen-helps/tips. With so many abilities it\\'s nice to be regularly reminded of them and HOW to use them with the few given keys.\\n[*] Dominating Orks? Creating your hidden army before raiding a camp and then with one button making them all your minions at once? Awesome!\\n[*] The new Nemesis-System and overall rework of the whole Army-system is great. Really well done.\\n[*] Graphically more than adequate and nice-looking if you care for that. Every region has its own unique look.\\n[*] In addition to the wolf-thingies and the troll-thingies you can now ride dragon-thingies. And they even have some special attacks and skills. Yay!\\n[*] Loading-times are acceptable. Once you\\'re in a region there\\'s barely any loading-times except for some quests. \\n[*] Loot! In Mordor it was boring. Here it\\'s a LITTLE bit like Diablo. You constantly find yourself comparing stats and upgrading your stuff. There are even the usual sockets to put crystals in. And the usual 3 x low = 1 time higher, and 3 x higher = etc. Keeps you going!\\n[*] Not enough to do already? Avenge your friends (and strangers) who have been killed by some Ork. Kill those Orks for a Chest to open (with some items in it).\\n[*] The new army-system is really impressive. So goddamn many Orks. And everyone\\'s kinda unique although randomly generated.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[u]The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*] The characters are so bland, stereotype and boring. Except the Spider-Lady, and the Ringsmith maybe. That may be totally just me not being a LOTR-Fan anyway. So probably you\\'d see that differently.\\n[*] May be just me, but once you get your hand on some Legendary items you just sell everything below. As you can upgrade the legendarys every 10 Levels AND they give set-Boni as well.\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n[u]The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):[/u]\\n[list]\\n[*] Loot-boxes. Please. Stop. Noone cares for my opinion, especially not those you decide, but....please. STOP.\\n[*] No targeting. While being nice to have a few keys less it sometimes really pisses you off. Trying to induce one specific treatment to one specific Ork can be a chore. You have no real influence who you\\'d target/attack.\\nCan sometimes be really frustrating when you\\'ve seem to have won the battle but then fail to finish the right target off twice in a row and you get hit from wherever and die. \\n[*] Those \"speeches\" when you face a new Captain+ or when he\\'s retreating: Cool for the first five times. And then...you can\\'t skip it. It can really grow ANNOYING to wait for their random insults to end. \\n[*] I know nowadays everything is console-dumbed-down and then just adapted for PC. But, no direct access to inventory nor quests with a key-press. Nope. Go to the main-menu and select it there. WTF?\\n[/list]\\n\\n\\n\\n[b]Recommended?[/b]\\n\\nIf you liked Mordor, YES!\\nIf you liked Mordor but don\\'t want to invest time to see the end AND don\\'t want to spend money? Nah.\\nIF you liked Mordor and don\\'t care to see the end as long as you\\'re having fun for 10, 20, 30 or more hours? Sure!\\nIf you haven\\'t played Mordor but like Action-RPGs with Stealth-mechanics (which you don\\'t HAVE to use) like Dishonored? See above.\\nIf you don\\'t like the usual Ubisoft-\"Formula\" of clearing maps: Nah, maybe not.\\n\\nJust be \"warned\": If you don\\'t LIKE to spend many many hours in a game you enjoy, you will be forced to pay money to see the end, or you just don\\'t.\\nThen again, who cares. The Story isn\\'t THAT interesting anyway.',\n",

       "  'review': '87 hours, and wow am I aware of every single minute of it.\\n\\nSome games are games you can lose yourself in.  I still genuinely can\\'t believe that I\\'ve got almost 800 hours in Fallout: New Vegas.  Did I play it a lot?  Sure!  Does it really seem like I\\'ve played it the equivalent of 50 days straight with no breaks (other than 8 hours sleep a day)?  No, it really doesn\\'t feel like that.  This game, good as it is, doesn\\'t have that.  When I\\'m not in the midst of a battle - which to be fair, I usually am - I\\'m excruciatingly aware of the passage of real world time I\\'m putting into this game.  Primarily because there\\'s very little sense of progress.\\n\\nJust to state it up front, I enjoyed this game, but it\\'s a slog.  The act of making your progress and retention of said progress contingent on randomness is a novel idea, and I don\\'t hate it, but . . .\\n\\nThe thing is that the lion\\'s share of this game is one singular goal.  Take over areas to secure regions and build and army to fight Sauron\\'s.  That\\'s it.  That\\'s the goal.  And having a clear goal is fine.  And there are sidequests outside of this, but I\\'m not motivated by caring how they pan out, because you already know that they\\'re not going to affect your main quest.  You just want those extra perks.  I love story, but I was searching for a way to skip the cutscenes because I just.  Did.  Not.  Care.\\n\\nThe passage of time made cutscenes obtrusive and painful.  Literally painful.  I was pained to watch these unfold because there were no surprises.  Nazgul will sneeringly threaten and you\\'ll resist, people will offer vaguely worded prophecies or warnings with zero context, making the information definitely useless to me, and if Talion isn\\'t getting the point he makes literally no attempt to request clarification because that\\'s not how Middle-Earth characters work - at no point in the books, movies, or either of the \"Shadow\" games does anyone ever stop to say, \"OK, back up.  Look, I think there\\'s some crucial context missing here, and I\\'m gonna need you to elaborate, let\\'s put this in layman\\'s terms, OK?\"\\n\\nYou\\'re battling through hordes of orcs and oh my god, [spoiler]do NOT go back to the city area after it\\'s been lost[/spoiler] because the supposedly-random \"Death Defying\" and \"Iron Will\" traits will be absolutely common.  Just about every orc you fight will go back to full health once you beat them once, resist joining your team, die, and then come back to kill you again.  It\\'s highly irritating.\\n\\nI wanna be clear, when you\\'re not going from place to place (which with fast travel and how fast you run on foot, is minimal) the game is fun.  Fighting is fun.  And I actually like the orcs!  There are a ton of them I was like, \"You know, I really hope I can get you in my army because you seem great.\"  The attributes are a little weird, though.  I got killed by an archer who was pretty verbose about how glad he was to kill me, and then he became \"the Screamer\" and just shrieked as a means of communication.  \\'Twas odd.\\n\\nAnyway, the game looks great, it sounds great, the mechanics themselves are fun.  The skills are a treat, the side quests offer some nice variety.  The gems you can use for upgrades are interesting and can definitely be a help depending on your playstyle.  It\\'s just a slog.\\n\\nIf you want a game where you\\'re really motivated to get into the game world and change things one way or the other, or to really feel like a part of the story yourself, like you\\'re having an impact personally (rather than just by default checking off bits of what the story requires to progress and having the same experience as literally everyone else) then this game will likely feel like a slog to you, too.  If, however, you enjoy the repetition and the fighting and running into orcs in the wild and trying to get 100%, this is probably right up your alley.  For the completionist mindset, this game\\'s almost certainly a treasure.  There\\'s a lot to complete with a lot of variation and none of it is impossible, but some of it is very challenging.\\n\\nFor me, these Warner games are great at giving me a game that I\\'m invested enough that I NEED to finish, but have 0 interest in ever playing again.  Even the DLC I bought, it\\'s like, \"Additional stories?  Y\\'know what?  I\\'m good.  Let\\'s leave it where it is.\"\\n\\nStill, recommended for ONE playthrough.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is made in layers of gameplay and that\\'s what I like that much.\\n\\nFirst layer you play the story till you reach act 2 (it took my 8 hours to finish the tutorial) then you\\'re done with basic tutorial, where you play a story and you get introduced basic element of gameplay like your skills, the map, the collectibles (wich most of them are puzzles so they\\'re not just collectibles) and so on.\\n\\nThen you reach layer 2 where you can build your army of orcs, you can use them to perform various actions and even intervene in other orcs affairs, all with direct interaction and gameplay where you can take part directly (mostly by kicking asses)\\n\\nAfter that you play a siege against a fort (all this during other story missions completely separated from other layers of gameplay at least till the end of the tutorial).\\n\\nThe siege imagine like a Total war Huge scale siege in real time where you play the part of the champion commander and you help your army to conquer various victory points around the fort. During this siege nothing is just there for the fuck of it, you can go anywhere attack from anywhere and fight anything that moves in this huge map with tons of units around, nothing is for show, everything is part of gameplay, at first you think it\\'s a cinematic bceause cmon it\\'s just too much, but then you transition in control and you undertand it\\'s freacking for real. (example of subtetly during a siege, u can assign prior to the event an orc to spy and backstab an enemy leader controlling a victory point upon your arrival at said point, if he succedes or not is another story, so chose well, OR you can just take them all in your army and bash the fort, for every enemy you kill prior the siege or assimilate in your army that are actually in charge of something for the enemy, the fort loses logistics and siege engines or traps and you gain them (if you didn\\'t kill it) based on that particular foe and what he was assigned to,!!AWESOME!!)\\n\\nWhen you are done with that you get to the last boss (the warlord) and you get to fight it, kill him...or...get in control of the fort, assign your hierarchy and the new warlord if needed with relative bodyguards to him , you captains etc etc etc because you know...you might get attacked one day.\\n\\nBefore the siege you can assign upgrades to your orcs of choice (that you bent to your will waaay before this) and give them unique upgrades like assign them to command a company of a specific kind of intantry or siege beasts or whatever you like (based on that captain traits and class)\\n\\nWhen you are done with this you notice the map like a total war game where you unlock adiacent zones (that you must explore and play in them) where the story progresses and you can build further your army to conquer those zones too one by one by forging your army and bending more captains to your will (all with your freedom of upgrades choices) and doing more sieges and more difficult.\\n\\nYou get to train your orcs and equip them with kinds of weapons or traits or mounts. (There\\'s Haredrim too). your troops are active and present and visible in the map and your named warriors are doing activities in which you can help them if you wish to guarantee a reward for you and them (and maybe avoid death if you really care about a particular warrior)\\n\\nEvery orc has its own strenghts and weaknesses and you must consider them before assigning them missions (in which you\\'ll obviously take part if you wish or just watch from a distance how they play out and maybe let the enemy kill your orc because maybe you don\\'t like him and then bend to your will that enemy orc weakened by your allies). They also have beautyful characterized randomized cosmetics and personalities with awesome procedural dialogues that actually talk about what you are doing using all the names of the characters you bring with you for insults considerations and so on, in other words they are alive, seriously (and btw they remember things, what you did...even bad things) also they bring with them the marks of combat and injuries..crazy. You can make an orc Deranged by repeatetly shaming it, basically you create a monster that\\'s totally out of his mind, or acts like a baby and beats like a train. The orcs talk in the open world about stuff that really happened concerning your actions and your interactions with you, you can notice that using stealth and spying on them.\\n\\nThe Orcs learn your combat moves and they get better at countering your moves if you spam them continuosly, and even make fun of you.\\n\\nIf you get killed by a trash orc in the map it gets the first lowest position in the hierarchy of the enemy and becomes named usually underlining his achievement in killing you and how he did it, if no slots are free he\\'s gonna fight a duel and if he wins he\\'s gonna get it, retaining his appearance (with armor maybe) and class and traits he most likely had when he killed you.\\n\\nYou level up choosing your traits and your abilities that best suit your playstile or situation.\\n\\nYou drop loot which then you can level up by completing challenges. There\\'s Sets, rares, legendaries and so on.\\n\\nYou get to socket your equipment with gems that you can upgrade with various effects (diablo 3 style seprated by armor , rune, weapon effects) .\\n\\nYou can order your Orcs to train in the Fight pit against other orcs to improve their skill, get rewards for you or money (and actually watch the match like a mortal kombat round), or make them your personal bodyguard if you wish. (I\\'m going around with a huge ass troll clad in heavy armor with a gang of berserkers that I .... IIIIIIIIIIIII choosed for him as mob).\\n\\nYou can order your orc or orcs to ambush another enemy orc activity changing EVERYTHING, from dialogues to outcomes. And you get actually to play that, so \"what ifs\" are a reality.\\n\\nYou can go online and test assault other players fort to boost your army (the target player won\\'t lose progress to my undertanding but I\\'m not 100% sure, get informed if it may bug you, but I know you can disable online features just in case).\\n\\nYou can get your orcs to fight other players\\' heroes in the Fight Pit.\\n\\nAnd much more.\\n\\nThe story is great, The characters very well designed (Shelob is awesome), the combat is extremely fun as well as the exploration and the animations are so beautyfull you\\'ll forget you\\'re playing a game.\\n\\nIt runs great on a gtx980 in 2k everything on ultra with the HD texture pack.\\n\\nYou have millions of hours of FUN.\\n\\nYou can customize every detail of your UI and gameplay experience.\\n\\nThere\\'s 3 expansions (Yes I used the word EXPANSION not DLC for a reason).\\n\\nThe game is freacking LONG.\\n\\nI another player gets killed by an orc you get to fight him and have access to his procedural created orc which are unique to each player)\\n\\nMicrotransactions are gone.\\n\\nThere\\'s Nazghuls, drakes, all sort of monsters and shits.\\n\\nNow this game does alot of things in a fun genuine way and I\\'m astonished how well they play out. It\\'s freacking awesome. \\n\\nI never expected this game to be at this level, I can only imagine what this studio could make if they were to make a Warhammer fantasy game.\\n\\nMy advice? Just buy it, it\\'s worth every penny.\\n\\nBear in mind in my review I talked about 50% of the game, I didn\\'t mention the story and other stuff.\\n\\nCons: The game is around 130gb, of CONTENT. So yeah, it\\'s not even a con.\\n\\n           The targeting system takes time to get used to, there\\'s no target lock so you need too aim at specific characters when fighting or ambushing, but nothing game breaking, you\\'ll get used to it. If it bugs you you don\\'t deserve this game and move along.\\n\\nThis game might look boring to someone or repetitive, that\\'s because they don\\'t know or played the game enough to understand what you can actually do. Gamers are used to have the Devs hold your hand and lead you to the end of the story with nothing else, this game is different, it needs to be played with a less casual mindset.\\nIt has nothing to do with AC.',\n",

Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor took me by surprise. The game was really enjoyable. Enjoyed every bit of it. Middle-Earth Shadow of War takes everything done right from shadow of Mordor and improves it by an unexplainable margin.\\n\\nThe story starts right after the ending of Shadow of Mordor. The ring maker and Talion (The main character) have forged a new ring, which attracted some new foes and friends. The story was rich and was enjoyable. They have improved the story. Completely different direction.\\n\\nMost of the gameplay aspects stayed the same, but some new ones were added which enriched the gameplay even more. The animation and gameplay felt more fluent and cleaner than Shadow of Mordor. Surprisingly,  The famous nemesis system got a HUGE BUFF. It was a really interesting and fascinating invention/system in the shadow of Mordor, But it truly shines in Shadows of War. No wonder why did, Wb patented it. It's MAGNIFICENT. Truly and worthy selling point.\\n\\nThe combat of this series is a mixture of the Batman Arkham series with the assassin creed. Surprisingly It's stealth mechanism and gameplay is way way better than the whole assassin's creed franchise. XD\\n\\nNemesis system spices things up since every orc you encounter has a different personality, different weaknesses different strengths which makes every encounter memorable, challenging and new. It's not just beat them up, it's thinking and dominate. You could spend hours playing the game without getting tired. Sometimes you will make your foes run away and sometimes your foes will make you run away. Sometimes it feels like you're playing as DARTH VADER in the lord of the ring universe (literally).\\n\\nThe visuals were superb. The whole world-building was extraordinary. The game has 5 regions where the shadow of Mordor only had 2. All of the 5 regions are different from one another. All of them are filled with non-repetitive activities. (depends on perspective) One is a forest base where another one is located near a volcano. Swapping out one region to another is a refreshment. New visuals new challenges in each region.\\n\\nAs I said the game is full of activities. It will take a pretty decent amount of time to finish. If you just want the story then it will take around 30 to 40 hours. But if you want full completion then it's more than 80 hours of gameplay. Cherry top on all of these is that this game has online PvE. Meaning it's endless. I aimed for completionist and it took 100hours! And I didn't even realize 100 hours have passed, it's that good. The value for money is unimaginable, even 60/70$ games don't have this much content nowadays.\\n\\nThe end game meaning the shadow wars might get a bit grindy. But it is necessary to get the true ending. One which connects with Lord of the ring directly.\\n\\nDid face some bugs but they were one time only, so nothing to worry about.\\n\\nSo if you couldn't tell already I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO EVERYONE.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Manswine!\\n\\n  Oooh, lookee what we got ’ere. A filthy, softskinned maggot squirmin’ about on the ground, tryin’ to dig up information for this lit’l ole’ gob ’o software ‘Shadow of War’. Well, if it’s dirt you want, Gamewalker, you came to the right orc. I’ll be more than happy to slice your head open with this sharp axe ’ere and fill it with all kinds of useful tidbits about this game. Yeah, I’ll pluck out those juicy lit’l eyeballs of yours and bob them into a vat of boiling facts and features, then squish the remains into your ears so you can hear how entertaining this game is and… and… then I’ll tear off your boots and make you eat your own feet while cracking your buttcheeks open to bite out your… your… rect… umm… uhh… Ohhh, just read it and bugger off, already! Geeeaaaaaah!\\n\\n  The first thing you’ll encounter when you start up SOW is the intro theme song. It’s a short piece, but a thoughtful, moody composition and gives reassurance you’re about to embark on a deep gaming experience. In addition to the music, sound effects and excellent voice acting, there are other aspects to admire, some of which were improved upon from it’s predecessor SOM, most notably the size of the download file. 107Gb. Stop rubbing your eyes, it won’t change what you just read. 107Gb. Save them for all the crying you’ll do as you wait for it to ever finish. If you have a crappy connection like me, you must resolve to the fact you can’t do sh!t on the internet for the next 30 hours. It is, however, remarkably stable for a game of this size, only crashing once 62 hours in because I didn’t run the file integrity checker. Sadly, the save file did not survive.\\n  \\n  Once in, you’ll find yourself playing a grieving, recently deceased ranger of Gondor, Talion (or, as they called him at the tavern Hard ’n Stiff, ‘Talion the Stallion’). On top of this, he’s also possessed by the wraith of Celebrimbor, an elf with a grudge against the main antagonist, Sauron. Think of him as a strong-willed, yet naggy wife no exorcism can remove. Still, he offers useful information to keep Talion advancing along with the main plotline.\\n\\n  The gear he gets to wield and wear reside under an interface of mediocre design. After you pick them up—and you’ll pick up plenty—they each go into long, long scrolling lists with no end in sight.  If you want to remove them, you must pay for this service. What?!? Instead of forcing us to deplete our hard-earned game funds for their disposal, why not just let us sell them?\\n  Like many RPGs, the gear can be improved, although in this game it took a rather bland design approach. Collecting augment gems is good in theory, but when there are five tiers, 2-5 requiring 3 gems from the previous tier, you’ll need to collect 81 t1 gems to acquire one t5. Despite this daunting task, however, there are quest rewards giving higher tier gems as a shortcut, making it somewhat less painful. It’s not until you can mount a graug will you reduce this from a slow, repetitious nightmare to a hilarious stomp and smush farming fest as you clear out entire Uruk encampments with your three-toed 7k horsepowered rototiller. I had all of the top gems by level 30. (Shhh! Don’t tell them I did this.)\\n\\n  Character progression is borderline cliché, but it gets the job done. Most of the skills are useful and provide new and entertaining feats to perform in the game. Skill point allocation isn’t balanced, however. By level 38, I had—what I believed to be—all the useful ones. By 50, I had 20 extra. Hey! Can I sell these too? [i]Sigh.[/i]\\n\\n  Controlling Talion is one of the best features of the game. The player motion is smooth, especially in combat, and you’ll want to explore every buttcrack and crevice to be found in all the beautifully crafted maps spread throughout this seemingly seamless game. However, before you can even begin to immerse yourself in this amazing kinematic experience, you must first pass… The Keyboard Remapping Test. At first, it seems like any other game: click on the ‘W’, then click on ‘NUM 8’ and ‘Woohoo!’ you can now move Talion forward with your shiny new movement key. But—for some neuron-disconnected reason—it doesn’t quite work this way. Take this disturbing example: If you remap the key to enter stealth mode, sixteen other keys will also be idiotically remapped to enter stealth mode and—for whatever reason—flush your neighbor’s apartment toilet. “Ha ha! Flooded your bathroom!”\\n \\n   There are numerous feats your hero can acquire to battle his foes, and it’s a simple task of paying attention to the visual clues—both deliberate and as a consequence of the rendered scene—in order to triumph amid a swarm of thirty, angry orcs. I couldn’t get enough of this to the point I was picking fights just to do combat, even if I got no advancement beyond a few augment gems. Screw the plot! Clang! Clunk! Smash! Smush! Stomp stomp stomp! Aaaaand… off I go to Combat Anonymous.\\n\\n  The foes you’ll encounter are just as interesting. As indicated by the intro, named orc banter—before they attempt to dispose of you—is hilarious. At first, I thought it would wear me down early in the game, but there are so many of them, it wasn’t until about level 40 I kinda wanted them to shut up and let me smash their heads in. One taunted me for so long, I expected to see an arm come up followed by the other tapping a finger on a wristwatch. He finally ended his babbling bitchboast by declaring he’d rip off all my skin and make me eat it. Kinda meaningless since, at that point, I’d already nibbled off a good portion of my right cheek in frustration. But, it did give me an opportunity to stretch out my neck and get the feeling back in my right shoulder… then eat a bag of popcorn… and half a jar of peanuts. Later, upon reflection, I realized this was by design, and they were shamelessly feeding on my frail and delicate addiction. You… sweet, beautiful bastard designers.\\n\\n  The final ‘boss’ battles—and some of the earlier ones—were tedious, rolling around on the floor like a circus chimp, desperately trying to interpret the clues to defeating the two remaining foes. “Ok, numpad+ numpad+ numpad+. Roll around roll around… squeal like I just got a banana up my butthole numpad+ WHACK! Witch king slap to my head! Owww! That hur… wait! Was that ‘NUM’ I saw? Should I drain… numpad+ numpad+ WHACK! Aww crap, I’m dead I… What? Hit the right mouse button to dodge the death blow? I did! Repeatedly! Nothing happened! Geeeaaaaaah!”\\n  Did you know a keyboard can sail quite far once it clears the window sill? That landscaping guy six blocks down the street? BAM! Beaned right off the deck mower and into a Morgai nest.\\n\\n  As you may have guessed—despite all the whining—this is a positive review. The game is entertaining early on, but then wears you out with what I felt was too long of a level grind as you built Talion up in preparation for the aforementioned cut-and-dry nature of the ending battles. But, I suppose they all come down to those final moments, don’t they. Admittedly, it’s way better than breaking down and deciding on a lame [i]deus ex machina[/i] conclusion where Sauron plummets to his death in a tragic outhouse accident because someone forgot to install the toilet seat. “Ha ha! Soiled your robe!”\\n\\n  This impressive production will entertain you for about a hundred hours and, if you have more talent than me to get through those tough final battles without dislocating a knuckle joint, you’ll appreciate how the ending climax ties into the original LOtR storyline.\\n\\n  I recommend this game to [i]all[/i] manfilth.\\n\\n  I can’t wait for the third installment of this franchise – Middle Earth: Shadow of Shelob’s Boobs',\n",

       "  'review': 'Shadow of War yielded plenty of hours of entertainment; however, it all blended into the same nebulous blur of indistinct violence and forgettable story. The moment-to-moment action was enjoyable enough, but after it was all said and done, I left the game with a sense of disappointment at the squandered potential. Of all the games in my library, this is one of the more deserving ones of a \"Neutral\" rating, rather than the restrictive \"Yes\"/\"No\" currently available on Steam reviews.\\n\\nI\\'m not a big fan of the Tolkienverse. Its aesthetics and thematic trappings are appealing, but otherwise not hugely my thing - so my interest in the game hinges almost exclusively on its own merits. This is where, unfortunately, it falls somewhat flat. The narrative is dull, and has you essentially completing favours for a rotating cast of unlikable and unwilling allies, with few redeeming qualities besides their usefulness to your warlord efforts, playing once again as the equally unlikable and unwilling Talion in his quest to defeat the boring and predictable order of whoever to protect the land of whatever - none of it is made to matter, with what little narrative progression there is occuring mostly in rigidly segmented cutscenes. At no point do you make choices that are woven in with the game\\'s events, thus isolating you from the rich moral quandaries explored by the greater LotR fiction. Your primary mechanical engagement is therefore violence, be it through direct combat, stealth, or subjugation of orcs for your own side, gathering them like Pokémon to bolster your own forces to defeat Generic Evil Lord.\\n\\nHow does the combat fare? Overwhelmingly AAA-game-design-by-committee, it provides fantastic spectacle and feature breadth, but lacks the depth to keep things interesting past the first five hours. Indeed, other than minor variations on existing attacks, those first few hours will show you everything there is to see. It\\'s impressive to behold - explosions, fire, ice, swarms of spiders and drakes, endless orcs charging at you, dismembered limbs and heads flying everywhere - and the sense of chaos is palpable. This is a game in which the butterfly effect can send minor events spiralling out of control, and it\\'s genuinely fun to see a small fire attack snowball into an entire camp igniting in a rampaging blaze, as the flurry of flames and destruction cause bedlam like few other games can... and yet, it\\'s surprisingly dull to actually play.\\n\\nThere\\'s unfortunately not much more to the game beyond its superficial dazzlement. The combat itself is rather shallow and sloppily implemented. Some examples of basic design rules that are needlessly broken: Player animations are random, rather than predictable, preventing the development of timing mastery; enemies can attack you from off-screen; damage triggers don\\'t match with certain animations or sounds, causing frustration and weakening the sense of importance of each hit; many of the multiple-choice upgrades have objectively best options; some weapon types are objectively better than others of the same rarity; Talion will often target completely different enemies to what you had in view or to which you pointed the thumbsticks. There are more, but the greatest offender to me is the poor combat feedback: Weapons sound weak and generally indistinguishable. Much like the combat, strikes come across as mushy and unremarkable, and the weight and satisfaction of impacts is so diminished that, despite it being a mere auditory illusion, you feel weaker and combat feels less engaging. Sadly, animations don\\'t line up greatly either, neither for Talion nor enemies. Compared to games with similar combat like Arkham Knight, it\\'s a significant step backwards. It sounds like a minor complaint, but when stretched over 40+ hours, I cannot overstate the importance of good feedback during combat, and sadly, Shadow of War misses the mark. Coupled with repetitive encounters filled with generally samey enemies employing repetitive strategies, it soon all becomes sadly forgettable, failing to provide opportunities to use tactical approaches during its endless fights, which eventually start to all play out the same.\\n\\nThe Nemesis system returns with some upgrades to enemy variety and use, but it\\'s ultimately the same as Shadow of Mordor: An interesting idea that barely ends up mattering because of how simple it is to switch between different playstyles without any long-term investment. Freedom of choice to this extent theoretically expands player agency, but does so at the cost of strategic depth by allowing you to switch between powers and equipment at any time, thus negating the need to actually prepare for the fights against special orcs with unique traits, and consequently robbing them of their significance or long-term impact. It\\'s really cool seeing orcs with unique traits, especially if they return bearing the marks of your previous fight, but like the combat, the spectacle is forced to make up for tedium.\\n\\nThe fortress system is promising - and it actually succeeds quite well. Despite being a bit too grindy, you can capture and defend fortresses by progressing through multiple layers of defenses, using specialised equipment and units to gain an edge. Among others, you\\'ll deal with traps, ogre-mounted cannons, beast charges, drake fireball bombing runs, wall destruction, and more. You can weaken defenses by assassinating commanding orcs in advance, but I found that doing so made the sieges less interesting and challenging. Though not the deepest system around (and certainly nowhere near as strategically interesting as it should be), fortresses provide literal and metaphorical structural constraints to combat, which emphasise unique mechanics and player dynamics and create memorable moments. It turns out that chaos is as its most enjoyable when guided by the rules of siege engagement.\\n\\nNot much space left, so a quick overview of the rest of the game: Graphics are decent for the time and hold up, though I recommend using a sharpening filter as the TAA implementation is quite rudimentary. Sound is okay, though you will hear the same barks repeatedly. The open world is much more varied and topographically exploitable than Shadow of War, though the game never does anything interesting with it. Quests are absurdly repetitive and unfortunately grindy. Stealth is close to pointless due to the minute proximity at which enemies spawn, undoing your efforts. Loading times and performance are good, provided you have enough VRAM to meet the rather inflated requirements.\\n\\nAll in all, Shadow of War is [i]fine[/i]. It\\'ll never be anyone\\'s GOTY, but I get the distinct feeling that its developers don\\'t expect it to. It casts a wide net, throwing mechanics and systems at you without much consideration for their true purpose beyond growing the bullet point list of features on the back of the box. It won\\'t leave a lasting impact, and in my 43 hours I didn\\'t encounter a single moment where it tried to examine a meaningful theme or concept - but that\\'s okay. It\\'s a big, dumb, AAA slash-em-up with towers, collectables, skill trees and meaningless quests. If you\\'re after McDonald\\'s rather than a dinner at the Ritz, this is the game for you: Turn off your brain, put on a podcast and enjoy the flashing lights, and you\\'ll have a perfectly serviceable time. It\\'s just a shame that such a strong license and collection of grand ideas adapted from other franchises ended up producing such a remarkably unremarkable game.\\n\\n[h1]★★★☆☆[/h1]',\n",

       "  'review': \"Alright so I have not done a review for a game before however I will try to be fair in my review of this game.\\nI will try to keep a specific format and there will be a tldr at the bottom.\\n\\nMiddle Earth Shadow of War has been one of my favorite releases of this year. Being a fan of mature and realistic fantasy, especially Lord of the Rings, this game holds a lot of both fun and appreciation for the effort that went into it. I will seperate this review into six categories, in chronological order; Game design/gameplay, world design/exploration/progression, story(spoiler free), art, music/vibe, and economy. For each of these I will list off the pros and cons that go with them;\\n\\nOkay so Game Design. There is a lot to talk about in the games design, from combat with both the main controlled character and that of the orcs on the sides of the player character and the enemy, as well as the games most marketed feature, the nemesis system.\\nCombat in this game can be fun, however it is not without flaws:\\n\\n-Pros: As Talion combat can feel very unique. You have several different ways to fight and you really rely on the enviroment. The learning curve is not too heavy, and at most difficulties you will be scanning the environment around you to combat different orcs. This awareness of your surroundings and your ability to adapt and capitalize on a variety of different mechanics and tools at your disposal makes combat feel a lot more interactive and appealing to continues with. For orcs vs orcs combat may vary based on the intelligence of the ai for that orc and their own skills, and finding orcs who excel at either form of combat or even both definitely blends well with other parts of the game. Combat never overly bores me, but it still has its flaws;\\n\\n-Cons: The main issue of having fun with combat as talion vs orcs is that after a good while of gameplay, most orcs are all the same. There are six different archetypes of orcs, and it does get rather repetitive. It is better that it should be simplistic in this case, and for certain there should not just be 10s of types of orcs you all have to be aware of how to fight, but after a while all you have to understand is what that orcs specific strengths/weaknesses are and how to generally fight them. This isn't too great of a detriment to the fun of it, but combat with orcs will certainly just end up repetitive over time and you won't be really playing the game for a unique plethora of enemies to fight, you'll likely be playing it for the nemesis system. Orc versus orc is not really an exception either, in fact in orc vs orc I would argue is even less varied. Combat varience is not the games strongsuit and as I said not what most people will play and stay for, instead it will be for the most marketed attraction of the game, the nemesis system;\\n\\n-The nemesis system, if you've not heard, can be generally explained as 'your enemies and allies will remember what you do and react accordingly'. Among the things this game accomplishes well, the nemesis system is certainly one of them. Using a complex series of ai this system allows a sense of realism and immersion with the orcs in the game, having their reactions to the things you do give a sense of personality. For the pros of the system;\\n\\n-Pros: The nemesis system in game allows you to find orcs you really like and forge a bond with them. Not many games can boast of a relation between you and the npcs in them at a level of depth such as this, and its a breath of fresh air for innovation of game immersion in the industry. Most people play with this system in order to try and get different orcs of different personalities whether by using the 'shame' mechanic or 'cheat death' mechanic. Definitely a system many would love other games to have, though the complexity of the ai required to create such a system does rather limit it to larger developers.\\n\\n-Cons: Repetition, that is that after a while, mostly concerning late game, you will find that there unique orcs, names, and personalities are far and few between as most spawning will probably be similar to others you have already found. Frustration can also be a very big thing since if you lose an orc you really liked, and they don't respawn, it is very annoying.\\n\\nWorld Design/Exploration/Progression: The game itself is very large, and the design of the world is of course based off of Tolkien's own, yet not every part of it holds up to such a standard. Exploration is not what you seek in this game and the progression system is, while not being too bad, is not the best either.\\n\\n-Pros: The broader world of the game definitely looks and feels nice, there are parts where it looks good and finding your way around the five different maps can be cool. The game does not have too high of a learning curve and the progression system is fine, certainly not terrible but nothing which feels too rewarding or fun TO progress through.\\n\\n-Cons: The maps, honestly, are not that varied. You will not be looking too intensely at every detail of them, care for exploring any hidden parts of it, or really spend time caring about the place you are in beyond another area to play with the nemesis system in. As for progression, after a certain point you are only getting skills you don't already want in your build and won't likely use often, meaning leveling up doesn't feel rewarding after the point you have all you want out of it, and progression can require a lot of grind and time.\\nStory: For those who care for the story of a game in Lord of the Rings, you may be disappointed in some ways. This game certainly holds true to the Lord of the Rings and respects the series, however the writing may fall flat in some areas.\\n\\n-Pros: It feels like LotR! This game, as I said, definitely respects the series and the writing, while not being done by Tolkien, is still decent enough that you can be engaged with the games story. You will likely enjoy several characters and how they act and the story is indeed appealing to follow.\\n\\n-Cons: Where the story falls flat, however, is in the predictability and development of some characters. I will not downright say that the story is bad, especially on the basis of it being a different righter, but there are for sure several stereotypes or predictable actions which some characters take. Character development mostly centralizes around Talion as well, so that other side characters really don't get used well, and I do understand that others do not like how some end up. Regardless the story is certainly fine and it holds its own as a good part of the game.\\n\\nArt: The game looks very nice and is not too bad looking at low settings, but machine requirements can take away from the experience for those with low end computers.\\n\\n-Pros: It can look very pretty and very realistic, especially with the 4k resolution pack(free) and you will likely not be disappointed with the look of the game.\\n\\n-Cons: You can still play with a poor graphics card without lag, but to actually get high end graphics you need a really good one, so don't expect the game to look too good with a low end machine.\\n\\nMusic/Vibe:(gonna shorten it from here)\\n\\n-Pros: Good atmosphere, nice to listen to\\n\\n-Cons: Nothing outstanding, some tracks repeated from first game\\nEconomy:\\n\\n-Pros: Nothing too hard to grind for and no hidden percentages/terrible rng in place, not unfair\\n\\n-Cons: Lootboxes exist, and while it certainly isn't pay2win as most lootbox orcs are not viable or interesting, they are still very unneeded and greedy.\\n\\nTLDR: The game is fun, and for those who have enjoyed the first one they will enjoy this one, however it falls flat in several places and is riddled with flaws. If unsure don't buy for the full price, but if you have the money and its on sale, go for it, its not a game that will hurt most people to play. \\n\\nLastly, I trimmed a lot of fat in the review, and couldn't say everything, but I hope you found this review helpful! :)\",\n",

       "  'review': \"❝ Lovely fortress you have here. Correction: lovely fortress I have here. ❝ \\n-A random orc\\n\\n[h1] 💻 Description: [/h1]\\nShadow of War nowadays is considered a [b] must [/b] have game for the diehard fans of the L.O.T.R. franchise. Even though it does not follow the story of the book, it describes an amazing adventure that can please even the most demanding players. Like its predecessor, Shadow of Mordor, the game is an epic story-driven action RPG game, where you utilize the power of the ring to its full potential. You fight and recruit armies of orcs that sometimes lead to epic battles, alliances and even betrayals. I enjoy the game in its highest difficulty since it adapts to the needs and the playstyle of the player.\\n\\n[h1] 📖 Setting: [/h1]\\n[h3] Summary [/h3]\\nIn Shadow of War, we are following Talion who is still infused with the ancient lord Celebrimbor, in their attempts to defeat the Dark Lord. This time, both travel to Mount Doom, where they forge a new Ring of Power, free of Sauron's corruption. Celebrimbor believes that the ring could be controlled, thus giving the wielder the ability to become the new King. Talion, who is not as interested in power, believes that Celebrimbor`s cause is just and they both decide to face Sauron and his Nazgul army in Mordor.\\n\\n[h3] Development [/h3]\\nShadow of War’s plot is a very delicate matter. As mentioned before, the game sometimes even completely breaks the lore, with the addition of characters like Shelob or the necromancer Zog etc… The fanbase was quite mad with some of the character progression, and the ending frustrated the hell out of the community as well. I agree with some statements, but not all of them are accurate for the reasons mentioned below. During your whole playthrough, the stronger emphasis is on the relation of Talion and Celembrimbor. Both begin to question their motives, as according to them, peace should be achieved differently. Celembrimbor’s opinion revolves around control, whereas Talion’s opinion around freedom. They both make valid points and force the player to question the morality of the cause, thus giving a neat touch to the interactive nature of the game.\\n\\n[h1] 🕹️ Gameplay: [/h1]\\nThe free-flow combat as well as its parkour aspect are both thrilling and mesmerizing at the same time. You can really ‘feel’ the power of the ring, as its combos and the surprising changes in certain ‘loved’ (by fans) abilities leave a special charm. The skill tree in my opinion is very well made and you can always switch playstyles to adapt to your different needs. Last but not least, the game revolves around repetition, grinding and careful planning, that’s why it takes time before Shadow of War reveals its true potential.\\n\\n[h3] Progression [/h3]\\nI enjoyed the different unique personalities you encounter during your playthroughs, both by ncps and protagonists alike. The main cast express feelings that can be relatable to our own. Their interactions concerning death and defeat, approach those of the true world, thus making their conversation more memorable and appealing. Furthermore, their adventures are not l. The lore has been tweaked, depending on the needs of the game. Shelob, as we all know is not considered a valid character in the books. On the contrary, she is just a deadly spider. This is not the problem though. I personally welcome changes, as long as they are properly made. However, certain plot holes can not be unnoticed. For example, the ability to summon Balrogs by certain [b] special [/b] orcs was baffling to me. How the hell can an orc move a stick and at the same time revive a demon? At least explain the process. Overall, the plot is decent but I cannot compare it to its supreme [b] gameplay [/b] style.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898678773\\n[h3] Scaling [/h3]\\nEquipment is primarily obtained by defeating Orc Captains and completing missions in Shadow of War. More difficult Orcs with higher rarities will drop gear that matches their rarity. You can upgrade the gear in the future, to match your level by coins or by completing a given [b] challenge [/b]. Legendary armour sets provide bonus stats, making Talion a deadly machine. During your adventures, you will encounter orcs with different specialities and levels. The rarity varies from common to legendary. What rarity Orcs spawn at, is out of your hands, however, it is worth tracking them down and claiming them as your own. That's why, look carefully at the nemesis system, since some orcs are very rare to encounter! Most of the time, higher tier Orcs will have some immunities and strengths. You can exploit them to your advantage, by tracking down a [b] Worm. [/b] For example, some orcs are immune to arrows etc... [b] Fortress captains [/b] tend to have more strengths than weaknesses, so be careful with that. Plan your ambush and get prepared before joining a fight.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898677633\\n[h3] Nemesis system [/h3]\\nEven though certain aspects remain the same like in the original, some tweaks make it more interactive and thus more enjoyable than the previous game. It is high risk - high reward play in other words, so choose your approach carefully.\\n\\n[b] You can send death threats [/b] \\nIn that way, you upgrade the gear quality obtained by an enemy orc. On the downside, the targeted champion comes well prepared, setting a trap of his own. The encounter becomes harder and you risk defeat. \\n\\n[b] Orc development [/b]\\nIt feels like magic how each orc evolves, depending on whether you make them an ally, shame them or simply cut them into pieces. I humiliated an orc so many times, that after some point he became obsessed with me! Your actions now have consequences, so do not be surprised if an enemy or ally champion cheats death, just so that he can serve you or even worse, kill you.\\n\\n[b] You can send ambushes [/b]\\nAlly champions join the fight. Encounters become easier, but you are risking the life of your companion. With this strategy, you can also level up your orcs!\\n\\n[b] You can send spies to infiltrate the enemy lines [/b]\\nYour champion needs to defeat an enemy captain in the [b] the arena [/b] to take the enemy's place. There are lots of benefits to this technique. However, there are also some risks. If your orc is defeated in the arena or for some reason is caught by the fortress master. Then, it is guaranteed you will bid him fair well, as he gonna meet his maker (forever ???). If he wins though, he may even become the personal bodyguard of [b] the Fortress Captain. [/b]\\n\\nIt feels like magic how each orc evolves, depending on whether you make them an ally, shame them or simply cut them into pieces. I humiliated an orc so many times, that after some point he became obsessed with me! Your actions now have consequences...\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2898679507\\n[h1] 🗃️ Side Notes: [/h1]\\nMicrotransactions were among the core problems of the game back in the day. However, this has changed making it more approachable and thus more appealing for us the players. The Blade of Galadriel DLC for me was a nuisance. Of all the protagonists Eltariel is the least favourable, but that’s another story for another review. The developers expanded the universe without reason. They tried to milk the already beloved concept, without putting much thought into the consequences. That was a bad move and they paid it in the end dearly.\\n\\n[h1] 📋 Verdict: [/h1]\\nFor the first time after so many years, we the L.O.T.R. nerds finally got a game that truly deserves our attention and respect! Came for the plot, stayed for the combat...\\n\\n-In memory of Garl Warmonger ([b] Legendary [/b]) orc.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'One does not simply parkour into Mordor.\\n\\nJesus Christ the voice acting on the orcs… is beautiful. \\n\\nFinally just bought the game last year. First thing that popped up in the main menu was WB saying that they have taken the market out of the game due to player base dissatisfaction. Just wanted to thank you all older players for making it happen. 😘\\n\\nI had a lot of fun with this game. Basically, if you enjoyed Mordor, then I’d say yes  Shadow of War is worth it. It expands on the previous game by giving you new ways to fight and travel. Enemies are more varied, and captains are harder to kill. \\n\\nIt’s also less buggy than the first game and has a bunch of quality of life improvements. The dlc campaigns are fun too as the characters have different abilities.\\n\\nI personally had an amazing interaction through the nemesis system right after I unlocked dominating Uruks. I was running through a fortress in the open world, and saw a bunch of Uruks standing around some grog barrels which I promptly exploded with some elf shot. All of a sudden, this Olog-hai captain comes storming out in an ambush and yells “MY GROG!” His title was “the Brewmaster” and I made him my bodyguard. \\n\\nEvery time he saved me after in last chance finishers, he would smash the other guy’s head in with a mace and turn to me to say “You look like you could use a drink boss!”\\n\\n10/10 would get saved by a drunken, grog-brewing war troll again.\\n\\nAnyhow, from what little I got from the game, Middle-earth seems to have a really interesting and deep lore behind it.

       "  'review': 'Man oh man do these guys know how to make a good game... and ruin it.\\n\\nGood Stuff:\\n\\n-The game, like its predecessor, is based around the combat and nemesis systems, which are a whole lot of fun to explore\\n-There are more environments than the first game, new enemies, more upgrades, and even an alright loot system\\n-The story is decently engaging (until it isn\\'t)\\n-Enemies have more diverse and immersive personalities\\n-I love killing those dumb orcs\\n\\nBad Stuff:\\n\\n-The game gets stupidly repetitive:\\n\\nCombat is fun but gets old after a few dozen hours (which you will need to complete the game). The last part of the game is just the exact same seige mission over and over and over and over and over and over with no cutscenes or story section to break it up. They made this last part of the game solely to keep you playing for longer so there\\'d be a higher chance of you caving in and buying one of their stupid stupid loot boxes. I\\'m severly disappointed in the direction the game took towards the end.\\n\\n-The story WAS nice...\\n\\nI\\'m no critic, but I thought the game\\'s story for the first 3/4 of the game was pretty interesting. The issue is, the story after the final part begins -- specifically that it doesn\\'t exist. I expected my many unanswered questions to be answered as well as some big resolution, which the player deserves after replaying the same mission 20 times, but I got none of it. Once you finish the last quest a cutscene begins that basically says \"The end\". Big let down on this front.\\n\\n-The controls are clunky\\n\\nIt often doesn\\'t feel like you have very precise control over the character. From time to time you\\'ll find yourself swinging at the wrong enemy or nothing at all (ruining your combo counter) and climbing is an absolute nightmare if you dont have a clear path upwards.\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt really felt like they just stopped developing the game once the final chapter began. They just reused the same quest, developed no story, and added almost nothing to spice up combat (which you have a LOT of ahead of you) all while not-so-inconspicuously pushing you to engage in their microtransaction system.\\n\\nOverall it\\'s a lot of fun and is worth the buy. You\\'ll be satisfied while playing it but disappointed and a little let down after finishing it. I\\'m a completionist so I progress through the game pretty slowly, taking about 90 hours to beat it. For someone who likes to speed through games they\\'d probably have at least 30 hours to look forward to. \\n\\nI\\'m mad at the developers and want to tell you not to buy it, but I can\\'t deny that it gave plenty of entertainment.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Score: 9/10\\nTime to 100%: 65 hours (Main game + DLC)\\nSimilar games: [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/209000/Batman_Arkham_Origins/]Batman: Arkham Origins[/url], [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/11450/Overlord/]Overlord[/url]\\n\\nYou know those games that are just so much fun that you can\\'t put down until you\\'ve completely sunk hours and hours into them, have to play constantly and consistently until you\\'ve done absolutely everything in them until about a week or two later you\\'ve found it\\'s finished, it over now and you\\'re a little disappointed in that because you wanted more, more, more? Shadow of War is one of those games. An absolute joy to play and difficult to put down until it\\'s been absolutely exhausted. \\n\\nPros:\\n\\n[b]Fighting Mechanics[/b] - If I was to describe the mechanics of this game, I would closely compare it to the Batman: Arkham series when it comes to the physical combat. But there\\'s more to it. You also take into account when you\\'ve fighting the orcs, you look at their strengths and weaknesses and try to combine that in your battle against them. Maybe there is an orc weak to fire? A possible strategy is luring him to a barrel or campfire and lighting that baby up and watching him flee. This is a game where you mix fighting, stealth, strategy, domination (taking over the orcs), amongst other things during your combat which leads to very satisfying gameplay.  \\n\\n[b]The Orcs[/b] - If I could pick one element from this game that seperates it from all other games and say \"This is why, this is why you should try this game\", it\\'s the orcs themselves. There are hundreds of possible combinations of orcs that you can possibly meet on your travels and it creates some real water cooler effects of conversation between others who have played the game, where people have their own stories of the orcs they have met and fought against. On a fighting level the orcs are separated into fighting classes. You\\'ll see tanks, beastmasters, marauders, warriors, assasins and several others. They then have their own tribes, which again adds additional abilities to their fighting style. On top of this is that they also have their own personalities. Some with bite at you, scream at you, taunt, sing or make weird clickly noises at you. Each time you meet a new orc is always a joy as to what kind of character you are about to meet, and in your travels you will find a few highlights.\\n\\n[b]Story[/b] - Although ultimately forgettable, I found the storyline to be very entertaining throughout. If you haven\\'t played the previous game you may be wondering, \"Do I need to play the first game to really enjoy this one?\", and the answer is not really. Long story short from the first game (which comes from the beginning of the game), guy gets killed along with family, guy seeks revenge, guy kills all those responible. One or two slight differences but that\\'s basically it. When it comes to this game, the most interesting part of the storyline actually came towards the end, when it goes more into the Nazgul. As someone who has watched and loved all the movies, but haven\\'t read the books or anything - I thought that shedding more light on them, who they are and how they came to be was very interesting and it was something I never really thought about from the movies.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n[b]Technical Issues[/b] - So when I first got the game I had a real difficult time even getting it to play. It would just show that it was running on Steam for a solid 5 seconds only to go off again and not start the game at all. This took me HOURS AND HOURS to fix. Firstly, I needed to reinstall the C++ Redistributable from 2015 which worked, but that was only the first part. The problem then changed into another thing, it\\'s solution, after all these years of gaming, was one of the most bizarre technical fixes I\\'ve ever come across. I had to - get this - update Internet Explorer. Excuse me, what? Yes, that\\'s right. I had to update a browser I never even use or give a toss about. The solution came from Warner Brothers Games themselves as seen [url=http://support.wbgames.com/link/portal/24022/24028/Article/1882/Direct3D-11-1-API-not-available-error]here[/url]. But whatever, it worked in the end. \\n\\n[b]Endgame[/b] - When you get to the last stage of the game it gets quite jarring. What was previously a very dynamic, intriguing story with lots of different things happening quickly becomes a grindy-chore. The story comes to a screeching halt and you\\'ll find yourself repeating the same thing over and over again like 20 times before the game comes to an end. It was very suprising how lazy and tacked-on it felt considering how entertaining the game was up to that point. \\n\\n[b]Microtransactions[/b] - The ever pervasive, constantly shoved down our throats issue that plagues many triple A games of our time, Shadow of War is also inclusive with microtransactions. It\\'s not as bad as in some other games, where it feels like a necessity to purchase to avail the full experience of the game, but it\\'s still annoying. You\\'ll find top tier orcs and gear (known as legendary gear in game), but of course they\\'ll be found at a much rarer rate so that you may be tempted to buy these things. I went through the entire game without spending a single microtransactional penny, so it\\'s certainly possible, but it\\'s still a minor gripe. Also to be expected with AAA games there is DLC. This DLC is availbe any time, but storywise tacked on after the game\\'s ending by the way.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Generally Speaking\\n\\nAfter all this time I missed a good open world game with a nice dynamic world with story and I found it in Shadow of War.\\nThis game does everything Shadow of Mordor does but better smoother and with more refined combat. Every battle and siege is different you have  different options. You can dominate warchieft to become your spies in sieges or you can kill them all for a easy conquest. You can send Graugs and Trolls or you can prefer riding a drake for your siege. Same goes for defend side you can get better walls or spiked ones to prevent orcs from climbing. There so much option that I cant tell. I mainly focused on siege mechanic because half of the game takes place in those missions and this missions are how they promoted this game. \\n\\n\\nWhat Happed to loot boxes?\\n\\nThey removed the in game purchase of in game  currency but nobody talks about it.\\nYes they removed microtransactions. Everybody yelled to WB and monolith for lootboxes\\nbut when they removed it nobody talks about it.(Interesting)\\nBy the way you can still open lootboxes in game but you get in game money from daily challanges you completed.There is no way you can buy in game currency not anymore.\\n\\n\\nHow About Story?\\n\\nStory is better than Shadow of Mordor and decent for a open world game like this I really liked it actually but in some points there was plotholes in them. And it was a bit short cut.they could have give us more information on act 4 s Talions battle againts Sauron but they rather prefered to put bit of it in Blade of Galadriel DLC. I watched the cutscenes I did not buought dlc s because they were to short and I enjoy more playing with Talion and Bright Lord Celebrimbor himself. Missions were also better designed and more interesting thist time and there is a diffrent type of missions which is sepereted from each other. \\n\\n\\nWhat Happened to Nemesis System?\\n\\nNemesis system is at its best. More dynamic and complex then ever. There is new missions orcs, beasts,  skills and abilities that changes your play style. Also this time around Talion have better customization settings both on abilities and gear. There is a new skill tree with new skills. \\n\\n\\nAny Downsides?\\n\\nOnly downside of the game is Shadow war (act 4) is a bit long and can give you a headache. And Graphics does not have the same dept as Shadow of Mordor. Contrast is bad lighthing is terrible and Talions new face looks like a dead cavemen. But I can still recommend this game because of the epicness of battles and combat. You should \\ndefinitely buy it if you liked Shadow of Mordor and Lotr lore.\\n\\nMy point to this game is:\\n84 / 100',\n",

       "  'review': \"Y'know, I honestly wish more games were like this.\\n\\nYou start with 'I want to make a game where you play one dude against a whole army of orcs'. Simple, elegant premise, guides your design principles the entirety of the way. Then you start to work on each little piece, like 'how does an ambush look?' 'How do fortresses function?' 'What would fighting an overlord look like?' and that leads to more complicated questions, like 'how do orcs feel about tenants of warfare?' 'what natural weapons can be available to take on a fortress as one person?' or 'how would an orc design his throne room?'\\n\\nAnd then you get to think about what made the dude the way that he is that he's happy to fight an army by himself, and you start to wonder about the kind of people around him, and how they might treat him, and how he might come to treat those around and under and above him.\\n\\nAnd then, presumably, you look up at some point after a while and you've designed an entire system that provides for dynamic enemies, the presence of cultural influences, governing principles for allies and enemies, particular combat styles and approaches, a loot system that seamlessly interlocks with the questing system and a vibrant and complex skill tree. And you probably think to yourself 'man, all I set out to do was tell a story about one man verses a whole army! How did all this sociology and psychology and architecture and RNG get into this?'\\n\\nA lot of good art starts with a single concept, sincerely supported to a natural conclusion. Under that definition, this game is good art. It may be defined (for better or worse) by the fascination with ultra-violence endemic to most video games, but I see a sign of something greater than just an evening distraction here, and that isn't just the shine and sparkle of the AAA property it takes its concepts from. Highly recommended.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I normally only review games I complete. In this case, I'll break the tradition. Shadow of War isn't a bad game, but it's not a great game. It's exciting and fun for the opening but soon hits tedium - game nemesis, play missions, capture fort, rinse and repeat in different environments. I feel like they made the game TOO big, and should've stuck with what worked in Shadow of Mordor while expanding on that game. There's nothing particularly bad about this game, but after 15-20 hours you will be doing the same thing again and again for another 20 hours. The graphics are good, the combat is pretty good (same as Shadow of Mordor), Nemesis is bigger than ever, but the unimaginative fortress captures just don't seal the deal. I was a big fan of Shadow of Mordor and left feeling disappointed - repeating the same process in 5-6 locales was not very engaging. Maybe I'll go back to it some day but I wish I would've waited for a deeper discount.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'THE MICROTRANSACTIONS ARE GONE!\\n\\nThat\\'s when I decided to pull the trigger. Bought it when real money purchases were shut down, and I was still playing as the full Market closure occurred.\\n\\nThe Market and its surrounding decisions were the reason I didn\\'t buy this game at $90CAD. Instead, I waited for the patches and bought it at $30CAD. Their loss, which I nightmarishly figure the whales may have made up for.\\n\\nTHE GAME ITSELF:\\n\\nIf you liked Shadow of Mordor, this is a solid step forward. Gameplay is generally more of the same, but it\\'s got more ways to progress, more stuff to do. A little bit more RPG, and a truly full fledged Nemesis System. I loved the Fortress assaults, I even really enjoyed the online stuff.\\n\\nClose to 100%\\'d the main story, minus some of the more boring collectibles, and felt I got great value out of it. If you go through the whole thing, it\\'s definitely a good deal longer than its predecessor, which I was able to 100% at ~24 hours.\\n\\nI haven\\'t checked out the DLC yet but from the descriptions of them in-game they sound like \"more of the same.\" Around the 50 hour mark I\\'m feeling about done with the game, but great stuff.\\n\\nA future Shadow of ______ game that takes the Nemesis, Army, and Fortress management systems up to the level of simulation in Total War - and perhaps some online co-op? - would be a game to treasure.\\n\\n*EDIT*\\n\\nDLC 1: Blade of Galadriel. This was a fun little mini-campaign where you play as a female Elf assassin. There are a few new skills and small mechanics around them, otherwise the gameplay is the same. The DLC is very short, my in-game timer reports 3 hours and 20 minutes to beat the missions and collect a few sets of optional Legendary gear on top. The mission complexity was very dumbed down, and that\\'s compared to the main game missions which are not setting any industry records. Enjoyable but low value.\\n\\nDLC 2: Desolation of Mordor. Another mini-campaign, but longer (still in progress!), where you play as Baranor, an NPC of the main game. This is the most Batman Arkham that the game ever becomes, complete with grapnel system and gliding. You can also consider it an \"Iron Man\" mode, since you only have one life. However, by the time you get through the game and try this, and with a liberal healing system, it\\'s not that easy to die. Enjoyable, but also low value.\\n\\nDLC 3+: The Tribes etc. These are just extra Loot/Gear/Orc collecting missions scattered all over the map, with each new Tribe including new Legendary Gear sets. The main game without these extra Tribes is more than plenty, so their value is very low.\\n\\nDLC CONCLUSION:\\n\\nNot poorly done, but it is two fairly short, samey, good quality DLC and some useless DLC. It\\'s worth a few bucks, but for 95% of prospective players the base game is more than enough.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Shadow of War is one of 2017’s biggest disappointments for me. While its Nemesis system is better than ever, the rest of the game provides a flawed and repetitive experience with some unpleasant practices integrated into the menu.\\n\\nImagine a single player game that advertises its microtransactions and season pass every time you pause. That may not sound too bad, but I easily spent at least forty percent of the game digging through the bloated and slow menu system. I must have seen them hundreds of times. In addition to that nonsense, you have the (microtransaction) Market section, filled with Gold and Mithril Chests that promise epic or legendary items and orcs. Other things you can spend your premium currency on include experience boosts and Featured Friday Chests™. \\n\\nNot everything requires real money in the Market. You can spend your Mirian (in-game currency) on somewhat useless Silver Chests and redeem rewards tied to the online component of the game (Online Vendettas and Sieges). Those delicious rewards trigger a glowing circle right next to the Market in the menu, you know, to make you click on it. That way you can be exposed to more of their premium offerings since they’re all mixed in together. It’s just the other way the game is engineered to advertise its boxes to you. There is some serious free-to-play mobile game design philosophy wrapping its glistening, bulging arms around Shadow of War.\\n\\nNow that we’ve covered that nasty part of the game, let’s talk about the Nemesis system. It’s good and the orcs make it fun and interesting. You’ll run into and be killed by poet orcs, orcs that don’t know how to stay dead, and orcs that will save you time and time again (to my horror, which I’ll go over later). Their responses to the numerous situations that can occur within the game impressed me. The voice actors put in some great performances as the orc and olog captains, especially when you earn the ability to shame them into insanity (highly recommended).\\n\\nUnfortunately, the game overstays its welcome with its forgettable story and unlikable protagonists. The elf ghost seems unable to say anything that doesn’t involve the word Palintír™ and Talion doesn’t really develop or seem interesting. Shelob is apparently eye candy with her fine humanoid form and has a unexpectedly dumb storyline tied to her memories (one type of collectable in the game) that becomes apparent when you gather all of them. The other characters in the game are a slightly better while the orcs are #1. They have much more entertaining and interesting personalities than everyone else.\\n\\nThe other big problem with Shadow of War comes in the form of highly repetitive and somewhat frustrating gameplay. If you’re the type that can’t help collecting collectibles, then you’re in for a boring and tedious ride. One of the worst parts about hunting them down is having to climb a tower that activates a mini-game that involves scoping out the territory until your crosshair shrinks enough to discover it when you’re close enough. Some of them have interesting lore pieces attached and others, not so much.\\n\\nThe combat varies greatly in its quality depending on the encounter. You can easily find yourself spamming dodge or counter for extended periods of time if the captain has the right combination of immunities and traits. Some enraged captains will endlessly lunge at you if they’re Enraged leaving no room to do anything else until they chill out. Sometimes you’re stuck kiting the enemy or you’re facing a tank who keeps healing over and over again (don’t waste your time and run away until you’re at a higher level). Other times, you’re being clever with all your tools and feeling pretty great about your conquest. Then again, you could end up becoming uncomfortably intimate with the game’s horrible targeting and wasting a powerful attack on an unintended victim. It’s a somewhat common occurrence with groups.\\n\\nOther issues involve traversal and glitches. Talion seems to have a fetish for climbing and will lovingly attach himself to any surface that’s nearby when running around. I’ve accidentally started climbing up a wall, pillar, or structure when just trying to travel from point A to point B. This problem happens frequently and with mounts too, especially graugs. However, the inclusion of the double jump was a very good choice and was fun to use. As for the glitches, I fell through the world once, witnessed silent speeches, and more. For the most part, my 33 hours didn’t have many technical problems and the loading times were fantastic on my HDD. \\n\\nThe mission design could have used a better touch too. Too often would I be going out of bounds in an open-world game. And it’s not a matter of running 1000m in the wrong direction, the arbitrary boundaries are poorly placed to the point of causing mission failure and having to restart. It’s aggravating to see that message pop up and doubly so when it causes a restart. Let me use the environment to my advantage instead of forcing me in a weirdly confined space in a game where you’re normally able to move freely. Since orc speeches are unskippable, you can expect to hear plenty of repeated dialogue if you happen to run into a very difficult fight.\\n\\nThe game has a weird grind going for it towards the end. Recruiting orcs means not collecting sweet loot off their dead bodies so each one has an opportunity cost between an item or convert, making the purchase of chests more attractive. I’m glad I got the Act 1 Starter Pack for 50% off with the 500 real currency Mirian which helped me stay geared up. Leveling up slows down too so again, I’m glad I ended up with a handful of 2-hour 100% experience boosts.\\n\\nLastly, I don’t understand the balance in this game. The combat balance seems off when it comes to the difficulty level. Normal is too easy and Nemesis removes nearly all the hitstun that Normal difficulty has. I found Nemesis to be an exercise in frustration since some missions could end up turning into huge difficulty spikes while repeating the mission on Normal made it a cakewalk. You can tune the difficulty at any time, but nothing can fix that weird gap between the two.\\n\\nI lied, one more thing, before I forget. That heroic orc that kept saving me wasted my time. The upgrade system for items involving fulfilling some requirements that function like a mini-quest of sorts. The legendary ones tend to favor recruiting very specific orcs of a certain level, tribe, and class. This means staring at the Army section of the menu and going through the orcs until you find the right ones. You might even have to pass time if you don’t see any available. Now when I found the right kind of orc twice, they didn’t have the correct level. My plan was to let them kill me so that they could level up and allow me to upgrade my items when I recruited them. However, this one orc I recruited could not resist saving me and when he did, he delivered a one hit killing blow.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Nemesis system and great orc voice acting carry this game hard. 2.5 out of 5 stars would be awarded based on that and the positive aspects of combat alone. Numerous things rubbed me the wrong way though and I cannot bring myself to recommend Shadow of War to anyone. Maybe at 40-50% off. It’s a horribly bloated experience with a sluggish menu. They needed to trim down a few things and go with refinement instead of having such a busy menu with too many functions. Oh, I do like the Photo Mode. Make sure to give that a “shot.” Hyuck.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I am writing this review in an attempt to further debunk the myths regarding MTX, while giving a small comment on 'game is good'.\\n\\nFirstly, the game: it is basically a MUCH better sequel to Shadow of Mordor. Everything is more expansive, intuitive, polished, and entertaining - and we even have many new features, as can be seen in the trailer. While many sequels are disappointing letdowns, this is exactly the opposite: it has improved on every aspect of SoM to some degree or another, and added much more on top of that. So if you liked SoM, I predict you will love SoW. If SoM left you feeling kind of 'eh'... well, SoW is still much better, but it might not be for you. Take that into consideration before buying at full price, and if you're the latter, maybe wait for a sale.\\n\\nNow, regarding the MTX that everyone is in an uproar about. I am not biased. I've played dozens of games with MTX, and many hundreds more without them. I liked SoM, and was slightly put off by SoW MTX when I first heard about them. But I took a dive and after I started playing the game, understanding the mechanics, and got a look at the bigger picture, these are my thoughts on the MTX situation:\\n\\n1. MTX are not required for any part of the game - I cannot stress it enough, but don't let anyone convince that they are needed at all. They're implemented in such an unintrisuve way, that they're almost superfluous in how useful they are.\\n\\n2. Nothing in the MTX is 'exclusive' - that is to say, anything you can get in the MTX, you can easily acquire with a little game play. And I do mean a little - legendary orcs and gear are not difficult to acquire AT ALL.\\n\\n3. You get free gold (MTX currency) from daily challenges that are basically just additives, since the daily challengs mostly happen by you just playing the game normally. So in reality, the MTX boxes are more like extra quest rewards to get a few legendary orcs for free. You also get tons of lootboxes from other sources, such as online 'revenge missions' against orcs that have killed other players, or completing some challenges for boxes directly.\\n\\n4. It's strongly believed that Monolith did NOT want to put MTX in their game, and that this is a move by Warner Brothers. I suggest people check out some basic guidelines on the publisher / developer relationship, but here's the gist: the publisher (WB) said they want MTX, and the developer (Monolith) must comply. Don't blame Monolith, I can't imagine they'd be dumb enough to do this.\\n\\n5. A special mention on the endgame stage of the game, Shadow Wars. Many people are talking about how the 'true end' of the game is locked behind a paywall. What they are ignoring is that the Shadow Wars is probably the best part of the game. Many people are even calling for an 'endless war' mode, wherein you can endlessly defend, attack, and reclaim forts. Sure, Shadow Wars takes a fair bit longer compared to the other acts... but it's probably the best part, so who cares? For those of you that can't wait to see the true ending, like that's all you care about or something and not how fun the game happens to be... well, gosh, if only there was a place that people could go to watch videos shared by millions of other people, that likely had the 'true ending' within the first couple of days.\\n\\n6. The game is still amazing, and should not be discounted just because of the MTX. I can understand wanting to wait for sales, or GOTY edition, or bundles or whatever... but saying you will NEVER play the game because it supports MTX Is asinine. Instead, but the game, and don't buy MTX. They track their income streams, and will see how many of you decide to buy the MTX, and how many don't - that will send a better message.\\n\\nHope this review helps some of you formulate a more educated decision on whether or not to get the game. Have a great day!\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'While I do recommend this game because it is fun in many ways, I can also say that this game has caused me many hours of rage. I honestly wish I could give it a rating of \"Meh,\" because that most accurately reflects my feelings about this game.\\n\\n[h1]PROS[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]Orc variety and personalities are fun and engaging\\n[*]Capturing fortresses feels satisfying\\n[*]Voice acting is done well (but with Troy Baker, what else did you expect?)\\n[*]Music is fun and diverse\\n[*]Environmental graphics are gorgeous\\n[*]5 different map locations with dramatically different environmental aesthetics (snow, lava, forest, ruins, etc.)\\n[*]You can ride drakes now, which is the ONLY way to travel!\\n[*]Armor actually looks really cool if you take the time to level it up\\n[/list]\\n\\n[h1]CONS[/h1]\\n[list]\\n[*]Target priority in combat is bullshit (no, I did NOT want to perform my Dominate ability on the archer behind the Captain I need for my army!)\\n[*]Parkour is so buggy\\n[*]This game takes a dump multiple times on the established lore of Middle-Earth, especially with Shelob (as a hardcore LotR nerd, this pissed me off to no end)\\n[*]Story is very dull, and you can see almost every twist coming from a mile away\\n[*]Defending your fortresses is such a drag\\n[*]Leveling up your orcs is a pain in the ass\\n[*]The AI is sometimes so dumb that your captain will literally sit there and get spanked to death by another orc 20 levels weaker than himself\\n[*]Some combat bugs WILL kill you\\n[*]The victory speech audio doesn\\'t play when you conquer the last two fortresses before the end of Act 2; this bug makes me really sad, because the speeches Talion and Celebrimbor give are some of the coolest parts of the game\\n[*]Short variety of orc names (I literally had three orcs named Ugakuga in one of my armies; it got confusing)\\n[*]Some orc classes are just plain useless; I never had a Tracker or Destroyer prove helpful in my army EVER\\n[*]Act 3 is considered to be the ending to the game, but it\\'s completely unsatisfying and sudden, which makes you want to continue and finish Act 4 for the \"true ending.\" Speaking of which...\\n[*]ACT 4 CAN GO DIE IN THE HOTTEST FIRES OF MOUNT DOOM\\n[/list]\\n\\nThis game feels like a fortress siege simulator that someone tacked a story onto at the last second. While capturing a fortress is fun and requires a lot of thoughtful setup and strategy, defending those fortresses (which is pretty much the entirety of Act 4) is not nearly as fun, as you basically just juggle one captain fight after another while your defending captains bleed out at a distance because they\\'re very incompetent unless they\\'re a Slayer, Assassin, or Tank class. If they\\'d put as much work into making Defense missions as dynamic and cinematic as Attack missions, they would have been much more fun. This is a shame, because you spend more time defending than attacking.\\n\\nMany have complained about the lootbox system, but I disagree with the assertion that you need them. Yes the idea of lootboxes is dumb and yes too many games utilize it nowadays, but I literally used 3 of the orcs that I drew from them, and they still weren\\'t as powerful as the orcs I got by just playing the game. You absolutely do not need the lootboxes to beat this game, contrary to what some say (and I beat it on the highest difficulty, so I know what I\\'m talking about). The thing you really need to do in order to keep your orcs strong is remember to level up Talion, because your orc followers cannot exceed his level. Just be sure to equip the white runes to your armor and cloak, and you\\'ll level up quickly enough. I reached the max level, 60, before completing Act 4, and I never used a Lootbox XP boost or any other bonuses besides the runes.\\n\\nAnd finally, my thoughts on Act 4... This final part of the game single-handedly makes me want to change my review to \"Not Recommended.\" Acts 1-3 are very story driven and focus on development of Talion and Celebrimbor as they use their new ring of power to turn Sauron\\'s armies against him, and after a climactic conclusion to Act 3 (which had a twist that EVERYBODY saw coming), the game devolves into a grind-fest of nothing but fortress defense missions. THAT\\'S IT. THAT\\'S THE BOWTIE THEY PUT ON THIS PUPPY. YOU HAVE TO DEFEND YOUR FORTRESSES 20 BLEEPING TIMES IN ORDER TO GET THE \"TRUE ENDING.\" But the problem is, you captured the previous fortresses with lower leveled orcs, and now the new orcs attacking you out-level them by at least 15 levels, so now you have to grind XP for all your orcs one at a time before you even begin to tackle all those defense missions. I absolutely hate this part of the game, because it took everything that was fun about playing it (dominating orcs, building your army\\'s strength, and adding upgrades to your fortress) and made it a chore. I was ready to blow my brains out from boredom by the time I finally leveled up my last orc and was ready for the final bout of assaults.\\n\\nWhy do I recommend it after all this? Because it gave me so much satisfaction just by playing it. After all the bullshit, after all the hard work, after all the grinding defense missions, it felt SO GOOD to sit back and watch the final cinematic. This game reminded me of Dark Souls, because it focuses on creating a sense of accomplishment after a difficult challenge. The randomly generated encounters kept it fresh, and in the end, I found it easy to truly immerse myself. Overall, I had fun, even if that fun evolved from tactile fun to the relief of accomplishment. Whenever I dominated an entire pack of Caragors with one move and turned them on their handlers, when one of my orcs leveled himself up only to turn to me and say \"Don\\'t tell me you didn\\'t see this coming?\" as he drew his morgul blade and sicked 3 Captains on me in an elaborate ambush/betrayal, when I pitted two orcs who were blood-brothers against each other and watched them become conflicted about it, when I threw the head of an enemy Warlord off a tower after capturing the fortress, when I caused a Captain who should\\'ve killed me to flee in terror because he was afraid of spiders, when I rode a Graug and ENGAGED IN AN EFFING FIERY FISTFIGHT WITH AN ARMORED BALROG... it all reminded me why I kept playing this game. Behind all the frustration, pointless grinding, and stupid AI, this game is actually fun to play, pure and simple.\\n\\nI can only recommend getting this game if it\\'s on sale for $25-$30 or so. I don\\'t think it\\'s worth more than that, but if you love sandbox games or loved Shadow of Mordor, then you might get a kick out of this one. Just be warned of the frustrations you will have to endure before the game ends.\\n\\n[b][u]HINT[/u]: I found a quick way to level your orcs... Most orcs from the Trickster class will tend to retreat once their health gets halfway depleted. Find a Trickster orc of a very high level (higher than 60 is ideal), and send your lowly leveled orcs to kill/ambush them. Then, help them out in that mission by fighting the Trickster orc yourself, and when he starts to retreat, let him escape. Your orc will get the victory and up to a 20 level boost, and that Trickster orc will still be alive to use the same trick on again. Rinse and repeat this for all the rest of your orcs until they\\'re sitting pretty at levels of 55-60.\\nYou\\'re Welcome![/b]',\n",

(no cosmetics, nothing, just few different follower boxes, hope they do something about this)\\n\\nAlso, as an AAA game I would've expected far more content, it feels like a lot at start, but later on you suddenly realize how little this game has to offer.\\n\\n...\\n\\nOverall for such game 60 dollars is too much I fear,\\nthere could've been so much more content and potential for this game,\\nbut they chose otherwise for some reason.\\n\\nI guess upcoming DLC's could cover for this flaw,\\nuntil then I suggest waiting for sale.\\n\\nI'd give it a firm [h1]7/10[/h1]\\n\\n*edit*\\n\\nSome of you asked why I didn't give this game thumbs up;\\nwell I don't suggest you to buy this game for 60USD,\\nas it doesn't offer enough content for the price;\\n\\nStory is short and leaves you graving for more,\\nand the few side storylines it has to offer doesn't fill up the gap.\\nAlso I feel this game doesn't have real replayability -\\nbesides trying to beat it in Nemesis difficulty.\\n\\nIf you feel you don't mind paying 60 USD for +40 hours of content\\nwith poor late game - go for it.\\n\\nMy advice is to wait for GOTY or sale.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So First off i played this game offline and online. atm 40+ hours\\nHowever there is a few things that is bad and a few things that is good.\\n\\n**********************\\nUpdate 5 Finalized last update\\n\\nAll microtransactions has been removed.\\nAs we all saw from the start the microtransactions had impacted the game severly and monolith decided to remove it to fix the nemesis systems problems.\\nThere is a patch note and a Developer interview in wich they say that microtransactions did cause problems within the game to obtain orcs the correct way much as i have covered on earlier.\\nBUT now the game has been fixed the market is disabled all training orders and orcs are now ready to be used INSIDE the game for free!\\nand surprise surprise \"legendary orcs are now easier to find in open world!\" \\ndid not see that comming ? :p\\nanyways the market and microtransactions are out and the game is fixed Enjoy sadly 8 months to late or so ?\\n*********************************\\n\\nUpdate 4!\\nAfter some time after release monolith has now planned for officially removeing the market and all the micro lootboxes and predatory mechanics from the game ( sucked people dry )\\nLegendary orcs will now be more avaiable in the open world and so will training orders.\\nBasicly all we said from the start is now being put back into the game from the lootboxes after they sucked market dry! good thing for players sad that it had to go to such extension as to make laws forbid lootboxes before it was removed.\\n\\nUpdate2!\\nFor once this will be a good point and update.\\nWith the first dlc released Slaughter Tribe they will be makeing Shadow wars Endless ( free update with or without additional dlc purchase )\\nThis is a good step in right direction hopefully they will solve aloot of the other problems as well later down the road.\\n\\nLets take bad part first.\\nUpdate3!\\n\\nPitfight AI sometimes can be broken and the orcs just stand there for a minute and then suddenly go berzerk and kill some one. possible bugg ?\\n\\nUpdate!\\nAfter about 40-50 hours into the game i started getting aloot of IronWilled Orcs wich makes them Impossible to dominate. \\nThis is no doubt a lockbox Mechanic wich is aimed at you haveing harder time to get a orc dominated.\\nIt was not in first game shadow of mordor for sure.\\nIronWilled can be removed at a super low chance ( so far my chances have been 1 in 29 shames ) while you shame an orc but heres the kicker.\\nIf you shame an orc they have a chance to became deranged wich makes them lose their personality.\\nAlso ( if you have certain skill have  chance to make them a maniac wich can be quite insane strong but if ironwilled then they will proboly be hard time to deal with )\\nOr in my case i ended up with aloot of very weak orcs and deranged and still ironwilled.\\nNow this mechanic is aimed at you haveing a slower time to get orcs so you get bored and buy lootbox orcs i have no doubt in my mind about this. \\nThis only happened later down in the game and well it sucks to be frank.\\nI found some very cool orcs i wanted but since they IronWilled i cannot get them without risking them to become insane and lose all their personality.\\nVERY poor game mechanic.\\n\\nSo Monolith lied about a few things in their interviews and such.\\nFirst of all they said there would be no advertisements on lootboxes ingame in a published interview. But as soon as you open the game and anytime ingame you play and press escape advertisement for lootboxes shows up. Wich is bad.\\n\\nNext Monolith promised everything that was in lootboxes was in open world. This was also a lie. You see in the lootboxes you get scrolls that can customize your orcs. You do not get that in the open world only from lootboxes ( free or Pay boxes ) Below there is a few examples of what you get from lootboxes that is NOT in open world.\\n\\nBattle Training (raises a follower\\'s level by 1)\\nArcher Recruitment (grants a follower an Archer Gang)\\nHunter Recruitment (Grants a follower a Hunter Gang)\\nDefender Recruitment (Grants a follower a Defender Gang)\\nMount Training (Grants a follower a caragor mount) \\nFire Training (Grants a follower a Fire Weapon)\\nEpic Training: Mighty Savages (Grants a follower a boost to the effectiveness of nearby Savages)\\nPoison Training (Grants a follower a Poison Weapon)\\nMount Training Legendary (Grants a follower a Defencive Graug)\\n\\nThis list is INCOMPLETE we do not have all the traits scrolls here there is supposedly many many more locked inside the lootbox system and NOT avaible ingame. Below is a link to the official forum where people asked that this be put into the game and not into lootboxes Monolith preatty much ignored it.\\n\\nhttps://community.wbgames.com/t5/General/Please-make-training-orders-and-reassignment-orders-avaliable/td-p/1656682\\n\\nNext part that is bad about the game is Lootboxes in a single player game was kinda over the line and poorly done IF everything was inside the game offline as well as in lootboxes then ok np but it is not.\\nOther than micro transaction things the game suffers from a little bit repetive gameing syndrome you do aloooot of the same things over and over with very little changes.\\nNow that was the bad parts.\\n\\nLets go to the good parts.\\n\\nGame features a very well made graphics engine and Npcs are well cordinated for the most part.\\n\\nStory is good as far as i gotten and sound actors are good but maybe little bit low on volume and subtitles can be a hit and miss.\\n\\nOptimisation is welldone i tested on my laptop and on my pc and both worked great.\\nhave not encountered any buggs so far wich is good.\\n\\nNemesis version 2 engine is awesome! you will love it.\\nSkill system is a little bit weaird at first glance but you get the hang of it later.\\n\\nYou can respec free of charge at any given time great addition.\\n\\nId say if it was not for the lootboxes this would be a perfect game.\\n\\nNow In conclusion If you do not mind microtransactions and some items being In Lootboxes only then you should buy this game. However if you do have something against microtransaction or you suffer from addiction disorders or similar problems DO NOT buy this game due to sublime advertisements in the menus.\\n\\nI do not know if they will ban people who have fun with the game with mods or cheats or such but i hope they do not since this is a single player game.\\nThere is a multiplayer section of the game but its like not worth mentioning couse its very very basic and limited.\\nanyways there you have my review.\\n\\nPS the amount of bad decisions monolith and warner bros made when releaseing this game made the game dirt cheap before it was even released i got my copy 65% off from a retailer on gold edition.\\nyou can proboly snag this game with gold edition 50% of at any given time from retailers or digital merchants.',\n",

This usually results in him leveling up. His attacks now 1-shot me. He is level 35, I am level 14. I think there is a story mode to this game, but I am too busy trying to kill Zuka the Uncatchable to care about the fate of Middle-Earth.\\n\\n8.5/10, super fun, solid graphics that hold up 4 years after release and runs well.

       "  'review': 'Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for \" Unauthorized use of software\" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I\\'ve never cheated & I wouldn\\'t even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.\\n\\n11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven\\'t laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on battle.net which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it\\'s the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can\\'t even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the battle.net servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven\\'t played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download battle.net and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially  cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I\\'m back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren\\'t cheaters and didn\\'t do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won\\'t take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can\\'t tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I pay 70$ and almost 100 hours into the game everything is fine and dandy no issues, just having fun, but when I start getting a little \"good\", I get banned for absolutely no reason at all. \"Unauthorized software\" and \"Data Manipulation\" I\\'ve never cheated on a steam game and I don\\'t even know how. I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It\\'s not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response, can\\'t even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also it\\'s not just me who encountered this issue, it\\'s multiple people, they don\\'t get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can\\'t even get a refund so I\\'m stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn\\'t care about their regular players, because there\\'s over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I\\'ve heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it\\'s ridiculous.\\n\\n\\nUpdate 1/7/2023 If you crash don\\'t click \"Verify game files\" it will flag you for data manipulation and you will get permanently banned. The games been out almost half a year and activision hasn\\'t brought this up or even hinted.',\n",

Accordingly, a table, database, or other dataset includes an “enemies attacks” entry, wherein a different value is separately assigned to each skill level and wherein each of the different values is associated with an accuracy of enemies attack, with higher skill levels having values associated therewith a greater accuracy of enemies attack and with lower skill levels having values associated therewith a lower accuracy of enemies attack\\n\\n[0092] Once an assessment is made, the computer program that executes the gaming environment modifies elements of the session and/or gameplay parameters as the session is being created based on the aggregate skill level. In embodiments, session modifications may include, but are not limited to: adjusting the number of enemies, adjusting the complexity of puzzles; and player adjustments, which may include players' health, damage, speed, available abilities, and difficulty level.

       "  'review': 'Edit (Part 1/2):\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.\\n\\nHowever, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.\\n\\nI will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.\\n\\nI truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.\\n\\nThere is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.\\n\\nI\\'m praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does\\'t rain too much he\\'ll down on the game when the DLC is to release.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit (Part 2/2):\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don\\'t get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n\\n\\nSkill Based Match Making - Since I hadn\\'t played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.\\n\\nCo-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy\\'s Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.\\n\\nThe maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don\\'t feel like Call of Duty maps. I don\\'t know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don\\'t really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty\\'s maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There\\'s just no middle ground.\\n\\nGame modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.\\n\\nGunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.\\n\\nUI - I\\'m not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.\\n\\nPerks - I don\\'t mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion: \\n\\n\\n\\nThere are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don\\'t put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did. \\n\\nThese other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they\\'ll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don\\'t, it wouldn\\'t be a surprise at all.\\n\\nThere has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it\\'s not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty\\'s on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.\\n\\nHowever, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.\\n\\n\\n\\n(You may find my original review below for the lols)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn\\'t mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.\\n\\nAs I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.\\n\\nI felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.\\n\\nThe main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year. \\n\\nI feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.\\n\\nWell... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing \"even better Call of Duty\\'s\" and \"bringing the franchise to new heights\"\\n\\nSo here is my message to the franchise for this decision:\\n\\nFuck you.\\n\\nAnd to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.\\n\\nThe UI is still bad but my game functions, it\\'s still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don\\'t care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I\\'m choosing when it\\'s either on the gun or just a playlist.\\n\\nMTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it\\'s still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.\\n\\nDMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.\\n\\nWarzone is Warzone lol.\\n\\nSpec Ops does get updated, and that\\'s good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There\\'s a blueprint tied to it I haven\\'t grinded for, but there\\'s a \"weekly\" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven\\'t gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.\\n \\nCore MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you\\'ll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision\\'s attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the \"de facto\" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don\\'t know how to put my finger on it but it\\'s a good \\'turn the brain off\\' game, but it\\'s not something I\\'d consider amazing?\\n\\nCampaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there\\'s not a spectacular amount that\\'s memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It\\'s a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a \\'tutorial\\' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there\\'s going to be a third game and they\\'ll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.\\n\\nDo I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it\\'s on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it\\'s slower than most \\'modern\\' CoDs (2019~Vanguard). \\n\\nI like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It\\'s alright. I wouldn\\'t switch to a full recommend because it\\'s still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.\\n\\ntl;dr\\n\\nits mid but its brain popcorn. it\\'s just brain popcorn that\\'s too expensive.\\n\\nI also can\\'t switch the thumb or it\\'s going to wipe ratings, and I\\'m not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After 600 hours of this game, playing multiplayer and DMZ, I cannot for the life of me recommend this game. Multiplayer is so tampered with on activisions part is unreal, leading to every match being all calculated either against or for you due to how matchmaking works. I didn't mind the skill based of the old games, but if activision decides you are doing too well, you are going to encounter the best players beyond your skill level, letting the next matches be essentially you dying over and over until your skill level drops and they match you against the most braindead players. You play game, you get punished, whether you are controller player or not. Don't get me wrong, pub stomps are boring, I like a equal match, what isn't a equal match is forcing me into the highest brackets of players because I do too positive and forcing me to have a bad time because their system is worse than most sbmm's I have ever seen in my entire life. This isn't even going on to touch on DMZ, on how their bots are either going to be the most blind, inaccurate computers you have ever seen, or each one is an exact clone copy of john wick, who is able to shoot you through the wall and glitch out very frequently, to which I'm not sure if thats even affected by anything or just IWs awful coding. DMZ is fun with friends, but a miserable experience when it decides that it will punish you for dare having fun, a vicious cycle of them rewarding you and taunting you back into the game and then beating the hell out of you so you're back to ground zero. \\nThis isn't even going on to how this game performs on most systems, which cannot be argued that it's pretty close to shit. It crashes for many people months after launch, bugs plague the menus, and by god the UI on the menu is horrendous, some of these issues which have retained since launch. I've been very generous with my patience, wishing that they would patch these, but I'm a fool for thinking someone like activison would worry about patching actual issues, rather than going for anything that results in benefiting the player more than Mr.John Activision would wish (I.E Exp glitches, Cosmetic glitches etc...). We all already know about the aim assist too, and the arguments that follow it so I won't even touch that demon, you want to know more, search it up yourself and I really insist you do.\\nI can say positively, that the guns feel good(the m13 and kastvov 545 suck though), and the variety is nice, until you realize 99% of attachments actually don't matter unless you're doing a funny niche build, which most have a punishment of killing your ADS in a game where ADS is the prime component of winning your duels, unless you have already pre-aimed. This game is so against the players, but at the same time keeps you in by giving you matches to you for free, drip feeding you to keep your retention in, rather than making a genuine fun game like the COD games used to be, just a simple shooter that can be played when you get home and not have to stress about the silly issues that plague new releases, and with a publisher and developer that ignore and probably hate their community. Even Halo Infinite, a game which has been plagued with issues since its release, their company listens to their users far better than this company (although that isn't a high bar anyways).\\nI went in with hope, and came out with cope, I cannot find long term enjoyment in this game, and maybe that's just me getting older, maybe FPS games are just not for me anymore, maybe this game taught me to go in the woods and be a monkey, whatever the end result, this game has sealed it for me that I will not be playing another CoD title after this, or at the most I will look upon the next ones with extreme scrutiny and criticism as I should have done before. I hope whoever reads this review can make a second opinion on this game, and whoever has already bought it I hope that you can find more enjoyment in this game than I have.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\\n\\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\\n\\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\\n    [*]Weapon tuning\\n    [*]Al Mazrah\\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\\n    [*]Proximity chat\\n    [*]3rd person modes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\\n    [*]Movement\\n    [*]UI\\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\\n    [*]The price\\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd the list goes on.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\\n\\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\\n\\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\\n\\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\\n\\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\\n\\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\\n\\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\\n\\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\\n\\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \\n\\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\\n\\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\\n\\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\\n[/list]\\n\\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\\n\\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Gunplay is good and the core gameplay is solid (like most cods) but there are just so many problems. Maps suck, no gun game, spec ops feels half baked at best, lacking many game modes that have been in cod for over a decade. Literally just MW 2019 but worse in almost every way. It amazes me how they have the audacity to charge $70 for a game that feels like it is still in alpha.\\n\\nEdit: Gonna keep updating this review as new stuff gets added, so far they have added hardcore, and \"fixed\" the crashing problem somewhat (it still crashes but not nearly as often) so hopefully they keep improving the game.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....\\n\\nHere is what I have experienced so far:\\n\\n1. If you\\'re good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big \"HOW?\"\\n\\n2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn\\'t register so you have to relaunch the game.\\n\\n3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).\\n\\n4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).\\n\\n5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don\\'t play any different here.\\n\\nOverall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would\\'ve had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you\\'re considering buying this game, don\\'t do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can\\'t let $70 go to waste.\\n\\nEDIT: Steam told me I played an additional 11 hours and asked me to revise my review. Here\\'s my revision, still sucks\\n\\nEdit: allowing comments, but only if you\\'re a COD MWII hater just like me',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards \"casuals\", nor \"the OGs\" of the COD community [/h1]\\n\\nBefore I get into the title and explain why you shouldn\\'t bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it\\'s kind, I\\'m going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don\\'t.\\n\\n[u] What I like [/u]\\nI) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn\\'t on the AK, when converting it to 5.45.\\nII) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn\\'t worth it since it didn\\'t make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should\\'ve done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy\\'s spawn, not punished for it.\\n\\n[u] What I dislike [/u]\\nI) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later.\\n•Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing.\\n•Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the \"immersion\" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly.\\n•The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It\\'s like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a \"brand new game\".\\n•Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect.\\n•The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter\\'s shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of \"realism\" to normies who think they\\'ve become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive.\\n•Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll.\\nII) You might be thinking \"Woah, that\\'s a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn\\'t have messed up worse this time?\". If that\\'s what\\'s on your mind, you\\'d be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves.\\n•The UI is some of the worse I\\'ve ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn\\'t work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it\\'d be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what\\'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is?\\n•There is this new \"ledge hang\" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It\\'s also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you.\\n•On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn\\'t like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max [b] every weapon level for every gun to unlock all the attachments for a single gun. [/b] MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it\\'s not even remotely the case.\\n\\n[h1] So, going back to the title I chose, who is this game targeted towards? [/h1]\\n\\n[u] Is it targeted towards the \"OGs\"? [/u] \\nOf course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The \"OGs\" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the \"red dots\" on the minimap and the perk \"dead silence\", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.\\n\\n[u] So, is MWII2022 targeted towards \"casuals\"? [/u] \\nAgain, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don\\'t have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new \"receiver\" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.\\n\\n[u] So what is it? Who are they catering to? [/u]\\n[b] This is just my take, but to me, it\\'s quite obvious. They are catering to whales. A small minority of neglected children and adult toddlers with too much spare time and money on their hands, who\\'s entire life revolves around watching pixels on a screen change colors. This is the purpose of all these recent AAA business practices (grindy battle passes and challenges, \"cosmetic microtransactions\", hidden matchmaking algorithms etc.), to turn you into a loser who wastes their time helping the publisher brag about \"player retention\" to their investors, and their money buying grossly overpriced digital outfits and camos just to feel something new, because the gameplay itself is not enough to give you any kind of fulfillment. DO NOT GIVE IN, and if you have kids, don\\'t let them play modern online AAA games, because they are designed to get gullible people (which every child is) hooked and detached from reality. Don\\'t waste your life on games that take your time for granted. Do you want to achieve something noteworthy in your life, or do you want to throw it all away for some greedy billionaire? It\\'s your choice, but believe me, there isn\\'t time for both. [/b]\\n\\n Thank you for reading my review. I don\\'t do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Not worth it. At all. [/h1]\\n\\nEver since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You\\'re simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.\\n\\nSkill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I\\'m playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it\\'s the same scenario since the game got released. \\n\\nAlso, if there is a \"ranked\" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn\\'t the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?\\n\\nExtra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I\\'m getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?\\n\\nFor some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don\\'t know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can\\'t emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can\\'t bother calling it aim assist anymore, it\\'s Aimbot. For real it\\'s aimbot. You\\'ll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you\\'re slightly next to their crosshair, you\\'re done. They don\\'t even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there\\'s no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.\\n\\nI get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they\\'re using just their thumbs to aim, but I don\\'t want to be a part of this. I don\\'t want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he\\'ll be able to get kills. It\\'s simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it\\'s not possible? Isn\\'t the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & Battle.net combo?\\n\\nSome TL:DR for you:\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n- Good Gunplay\\n- Good Animations\\n- Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons\\n- Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock\\n- AMD\\'s FSR works pretty well\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n- SBMM\\n- No Crossplay opt-out choice\\n- Inconsistent footsteps & audio\\n- No Stopping Power as a perk\\n- No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk\\n- Matches feel rigged\\n\\nEdited for spelling errors.',\n",

But if you are a fan of the \"golden age\" of cod its time to stop buying these new CoD games, it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games. Take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one, they are pandering to us (the old guard of CoD haha) and will continue to push this disgusting micro-transaction/live service model of modern gaming. You probably don\\'t need me to tell you it ain\\'t like it used to be.\\n\\nCampaign was fine, some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy.\\nMultiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but TTK is fast, possibly fastest we have seen.\\nGraphics are great! Feels like it runs better than previous new CoDs.\\nRegardless its more of the same safe new CoD that you probably either already love or hate. If I could give this a score out of 10 I would probably say 7/10 but it would score higher if there weren\\'t so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers, but loses points for predatory marketing practices. \\nWhy did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous CoDs?\\nOn the chance that you are new to CoD and have not purchased one before, don\\'t start here, and avoid giving this company your money.\\n\\nProbably gonna keep playing but that\\'s only really because of Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 flopping hard, yay modern AAA gaming.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This probably the most well made piece of garbage that has ever been put out. First lets talk about the obvious one.... the hacking is off the charts, the number of times I\\'ve been tracked through walls is amazing, and if its not that its some player with the aim of a god (cronus zen and other aim assist mods that the \"anticheat\" doesn\\'t do anything about). And the reason they don\\'t do anything about it is because so many of the streamers are cheating but COD cant afford to loose the streamers. Next, is the spawning... how does a game developer make the exact same type of game decade after decade and still cant figure out how to spawn people, you will spawn directly in front of enemies, you spawn behind a teammate that is already being shot at , you\\'ll spawn in the middle of the enemy team and get melted immediately or wipe out their whole team from behind, and if you don\\'t get those spawns you get the complete opposite and the game spawns you 5 miles away from anyone. Not only that but the game seems to do it on purpose, its been a common theme that once you start doing well in a game all of the sudden you start spawning in random spots and messes up the whole flow and allows the other team to take over areas they weren\\'t able to before hand. On another note the game really seems to nerf in real time. It is common to hear about and experience yourself, once you start doing well in a game mode or even mid game it seems to start taking more shots to kill people, footsteps seems to get softer, you start dying to less shots, it just seems fishy. The weapons are a whole other issue, they are so unbalanced its crazy. Getting two shot\\'d (often one shot) by pistols but yet my .308 that leaves a baseball sized hole in your chest doesnt kill because \"iTs NoT a HeAdShOt\". Not to mention, what is the point of having three different sniper (high caliber) rifle classes if all of them are going to be mobile and easy to use, why is a full size 338  easier to handle than a spr even with both having the short barrels? Lets move onto sound. I don\\'t have the best headset around (arctis pro 7+) but they are pretty decent for my standards. Footsteps in this game are horrendous, you can barely hear yourself think due to your own footsteps but enemy footsteps are so quiet you cant even hear them, the game even makes your teammates loud, you can hear your teammate on the second floor 6 rooms down better than you can hear an enemy coming through the doorway 3 meters to your side. The only mode that its not an issue is S&D and even then the sounds don\\'t seem accurate, for example the map that you can swim has really loud boards when you run, i cant count how many times ive been on that map and been like \"oh that guy is still on the boards\" so i pop out to catch him but when i pop out the dude is like 5 meters down the concrete slab and already pulled up on me. lets move on to performance, I have never had an issue running games on this PC but this game eats my GPU, i mean constant 98% utilization... NFS heat doesn\\'t even get that high. Not only that but the game constantly crashes. Want to edit your class mid game? To bad you\\'re going to have to force close the game then boot it back up again. Want to go through the store or battle pass while waiting in a lobby? Too bad, restart the game. Want to lag with 25 latency? Well you are in luck! Next the leveling up. I have never played a game where you basically needed double xp tokens to rank up quickly at all. For example yesterday i had three games in a row where i got 30+ kills, anyone wanna guess how many times my weapons and soldier ranked up in that 90+ kill span? Well my Orbiter went from lvl 3 to 5, my revolver went up a half of a level, and i progressed one xp level as a whole... I mean come on, what a joke. The game is all around pretty bad, usually i don\\'t leave reviews but after paying $100 for this game i really feel robbed. If you are a toxic chad that plays literally nothing else but COD this game is perfect for you.',\n",

Add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter into a mixing bowl and stir until well combined.\\n-Transfer the crumb mixture into a 9-in / 23 cm deep-dish pie pan. Press the crumbs tightly into the bottom and up the sides of the pie dish. Set aside.\\n-Mix filling. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a large mixing bowl and add the egg yolks and lemon zest. Whisk to combine. Add the lemon juice and whisk vigorously until well combined and you no longer see any juice. The lemon juice will thicken the condensed milk.\\n-Bake. Pour the lemon filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. The lemon pie is done when the edges are set and only slightly jiggly in the centre.\\n-Cool & refrigerate. Remove the pie from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate until firm for at least 3 hours before serving.\\n-Garnish. Decorate the pie as desired. I dressed up my pie with puffs of whipped cream, lemon slices, a sprinkle of lemon zest, and sliced almonds.\\n-Serve. Slice the pie into 10 to 12 pieces and serve cold. Enjoy!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[b] Yes, I recommend this, but changes need to be made [/b]\\nStarting off with the positives:\\n1. This game is gorgeous, the atmosphere, weapons, animations, and characters are on another level\\n2. The gunplay is fantastic. Everything feels very real, and the guns are fun to use\\n3. The campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original MW2.\\n4. The multiplayer, WHEN BALANCED, is a lot of fun to play\\nHOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this game.\\n1. Breaking up lobbies to readjust for SBMM not only penalizes the player for playing well, it also doesn't give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older CODs.\\n2. The aim assist on the controller is mind numbing. The fact that I switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign.\\n3. The main menu/UI in this game has to be the worst I have ever seen.\\n4. Weapon balancing is desperately needed.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend because the problems with the game can be solved and I see at least a couple of them being resolved in the next few patches. But jfc, it needs work.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'this is a reveiw literally the second day after the games full release, ill be sure to change it as they improve and update the game.\\n\\n(THERE WILL BE SPOILERS FOR THE CAMPAIGN)\\n\\nfirst, the game currently is a 3/5\\nthe campaign is fantastic, lots of variety and levels that really suck you in as you pull covert operations or go guns blazing in crazy gunfights. a bit disappointing that Farah is mentioned for one level, Hadir or Alex are never mentioned or seen, questions and concerns from the first game arent really addressed in this game. but overall it was a wonderful experience.\\n\\n\\nthe multiplayer\\n\\nas of posting this 10/29/2022\\n\\nthe multi is good, most of the maps on release are actually not bad at all, i really like the racewway and border checkpoint maps. the guns feel good, look good, even pistols got a bit of love in terms of firepower and range which is nice. all of the base ops are unlockable via challenges and theres a great amount of them, providing players some personal customization which is great if some really dont want to spend the money of characters when theyre all just cosmetic.\\ni also really really like how camos are done know, with each gun having four camos which, when unlocked through a much simpler camo challenge, are unlocked for all guns. no longer having to grind every gun out for the same camos over and over and over doing mundane repetitive and sometimes frustrating challenges just to reach the mastery camos.\\n\\none of the biggest problems however is currently the game is having a bit of a glitchy release.\\n1. the game is very prone to crashing, i think if youre graphics settings cant meet a requirement sometimes the game just kills itself and i have to sit for up to 10 minutes just waiting for steam to verify the game files for the umpteenth time.\\n2. Camos are glitching out, i spent all day grinding out the camo challenges excitedly to get the gold camo for the m4, just to see that i am unable to select any of the mastery camos to see if ive unlocked the gold camo challenge\\n3. the voice channels is a VERY GOOD idea, it allows friends playing through crossplay to talk and play together in  game so that all parties can still hear the game since things like discord and skype or pc and phone only, problems is its broken, there were so many times where we kept getting muted after loading into match no matter how we set our vc preference, we couldnt hear one person but he could hear us, and i was hoping that the vc would be prioritized whether you were loading in, or in a match while your friend wasnt. he has a ps4 so takes a bit longer to load in, but i cant hear or talk to him until hes loading into the match.\\n4. there is a SEVERE lack of content. im unsure if maybe IW is waiting until season one before releasing a bunch of content but we are missing quite a bit compared to the beta. executions that were seen from most operators in the beta have been removed so that everyone all has the same one, i unlocked the beta skin for horangi, but am unable to access his base skin so far it seems only the milsim ops have customizable skins. there was alot of hype and speculation that a few popular guns such as the honey badger was going to be added to the game, but its not there, think it was even usable in the campaign but i may have been confused. but its likely they removed it from the start of the game to use it as a season 1 weapon. \\n\\nso far the game is good, but not great, its prone to bugs and glitches and breaks and needs a bit more post release polish, which i think we all hope to see within the coming weeks, and hopefully not having to wait for fixes until Nov 16th. \\n\\nsorry for the awful review this is my first time writing a legitimate one and i had pretty much know clue how to convey everything clear and concise. tell me im stupid if it helps',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m going to split my review of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II into a single-player and multiplayer section. I\\'ll start with the campaign:\\n\\nThe campaign was an enjoyable filler experience (emphasis on filler) for me and nothing more than that - I felt like at times the campaign went from awesome to cringe, awesome to cringe, over and over again. Some of the missions were super cool (e.g: \"Recon By Fire\"), whilst others were quite cringe (e.g \"Violence And Timing\", this mission especially felt like something taken out of a Bollywood film - felt quite unnatural and out of place to be honest). This year there was clearly a heavy emphasis on stealth like missions, which personally fell in good taste, but some might dislike that. \"Alone\" on the hardest difficulty and doing the achievement that requires you to not fire a gun was one of the toughest challenges I have had in a long time. \\n\\nThe biggest selling point for me must be the sheer attention to detail in things like level design (the Amsterdam level is absolutely gorgeous), gun animations, etc, and my personal favourite, the sound design. The sound of the guns, impact of the grenades, flash-bangs, in this game is truly art. The guns and explosives genuinely feel powerful and effective - compared to other years where they might sound more \"toy\" like. TL;DR: Decent campaign at best, nothing mesmerising that will stick with you, forgettable but good filler experience. A good bonus to the multiplayer.\\n\\nIt is worth adding that the game ran beautifully on my 3070/i5-11400 PC and throughout a 7.5 hour campaign, I experienced around 3 crashes, which in my eyes is not that bad - given how games are these days \"just\" 3 crashes is considered polished. \\n\\nNow, for the part everyone really buys Call of Duty for... the multiplayer: \\n\\nAs far as level design goes, I am on the fence. Some of the maps are quite good like Al Bagra Fortress, Farm 18 and El Asilo, where others leave more to be desired. Visually speaking they are all gorgeous to look at, but some of them play horribly and I am not a fan personally, though this is of course subjective. Honestly, there is not much to say about the multiplayer aspect of the game as of right now - if you enjoyed Modern Warfare 2019 you will most likely enjoy this game too and get a good few hours of fun from this game.',\n",

All hitmarkers\" and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of fucking times it just erases my existence? \\n\\nI just cannot have fun on here. Even as a team anymore. With the SBMM and EOMM, I get punished immediately if I do slightly good in a match, by being thrown in matches with people that just shit on me the entire time. \\nPeople complain that movement is slow and terrible, but it\\'s not. If it was, then explain why sliding and shooting around corners, or jumping and shooting is the strategy. Movement is still super fast and fucking stupid just like before.\\nShields and knives are near impossible to counter. Their feet are covered, can\\'t flank because they will rush and kill you. Can\\'t throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you. Thanks.\\nAll I want is to jump into matches and have fun. No, not just stomp everyone, that\\'s not fun. I want to have fun. I want varied lobbies, showing that people aren\\'t just bots. It doesn\\'t help that the aim assist actually tracks for you, with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not. If your aim starts to move on it\\'s own, you just aim and fire and you\\'re gonna get the kill. I position myself better and shoot first? Doesn\\'t matter. Enemy moves around, causing me to have to MANUALLY track them with my mouse and eyes, while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake. While they can just slightly tilt R stick down and fire. Flinch? Damn right that I do but when you have aim assist, the tracking pretty much counters it. There\\'s nothing fun about it. I am only playing it for fear of missing out, and since I already bought the damn thing. The campaign was fun but that alone isn\\'t worth what I paid.\\nI am not ok, and this game is making shit worse. It is infuriating, by design. I can\\'t even get good games anymore. What is the new \"good\" for me is if I am close to breaking even. Before I could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where I actually do good. Now it\\'s just getting wrecked at spawn, or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has UAV that works through Ghost. Or, I shoot someone first, hit them twice, and they snap and melt me with their braindead controller aim assist.',\n",

I work 9 hours a day and I would like to just relax and enjoy the game but god forbid i get 1.10 KD and I'm off into the lobby of tryhard 13 year olds who havnt showered since release. I am really tired of this garbage that comes out. I cant even play this game with my girlfriend. had she been in my lobbies she cant even play. Just an unfun experience really. not every game needs to be extremely tryhard. I miss being able to play the game with good players AND bad players. also there is way too many cheesy builds to run. already seeing at least 1 shield knife runner every other game. For $70 and only MP to play with a 5 hour campaign, this game is not worth that much.\",\n",

They were kind enough to refund the game. \\n\\nBut the game I did play was fun, the community was the same exact way I left it back when Modern Warfare 2 was first on the XBOX 360. The guns feel great to use, and customization isn't a drag to deal with. I never did get to play the campaign so i cannot with good heart recommend. I hope you all find some kind of enjoyment from the game.\\n\\nP.S to prevent being banned, All i saw online is try to not tab out. Or verify game files. Or else you will be banned\",\n",

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\\n\\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\\n\\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\\n\\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\\n\\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I saw the Overwhelmingly Positive reviews for the game initially and as someone who loves tactical RPGs I was pretty excited. I played through the entire thing on normal, and before I posted this I also watched part of a friends play through on hard.\\n\\nThe overall mechanics are pretty standard tactics fare, although its hard to say how much they really affect the overall game-play. From a personal perspective I felt the game was too easy in the beginning and the difficulty in hard mode came from being more irritating than tactical. \\n\\nThe real problem with the game is the story and writing. It feels like the plot was written by Asylum Films - a facade of a game story that's just aping other tactics games . They knew what story beats SHOULD be in the game, but not how to make them interesting or how to get from one to another naturally. Each time something would happen I kept hoping that this was going to be change or twist, but it takes the worst option at any turn. SPOILERS: [spoiler] The main character dies but then turns out to be fantasy Jesus, his childhood friend turns out to be the long lost king of a nation, You get betrayed by your friend but it is IMMEDIATELY resolved and has no relevance, etc. [/spoiler]\\n\\nThe romances are even worse. There's almost no lead up to any of them, and most of the characters have at max 1 conversation before falling in love, and then they rarely if ever say anything afterward. A lot of the dialogue gives off weird incel vibes too:\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/uPfhFIW\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/8fkEyKZ\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/rZHfYkz\\n\\nA lot of the writing also felt like someone's fetish material. SPOILERS: [spoiler] Diana, one of the main characters, starts out wearing plate mail (although it has boobs), then gets a costume change where she grows super huge and starts wearing a leotard. [/spoiler]\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/tZneDcc\\n\\nIn summary, while the game is fine the story and writing actually drag it down. A day or so after finishing it I'm basically left feeling disappointed.</td>\n",

Your guys are walking gods while the enemy squads are jokes.\\n\\nThe \"hard\" difficulty is insanely frustrating, as losing high level units permanently because the AI randomly happened to focus them down is not fun unless you really love save scumming.\\n\\nThere's no proper challenge here, so there's no point in playing this.

       "      <td>Executive summary: It's Fire Emblem/ Battle For Wesnoth but with a worse interface and a cool squad mechanic.\\n\\nPros\\n1. Creating unit formations is awesome\\nThis is probably the biggest contribution the game has brought to the tactics genre. Instead of controlling 1 person per square, you control a formation of units per a square. When these squads face off, their formations dictate how the engagement will work. I like this mechanic. I played the game for hours longer than I otherwise would have because I wanted to see what kind of weird squads I could make. \\n\\n2. Music is fine.\\nFor real, it's decent music.\\n\\nCons\\n1. Terrible UI and controls\\nInformation you need to make decisions is not available in locations where it would be most useful. For instance, the organize squads screen doesn't have squad capacity shown until you click deeper into that menu. You cannot see if an enemy squad has ranged units at a glance, either. Finding or doing anything is several extra clicks away than it needs to be. It is all very playable but it gets quite annoying. Also the mouse controls feel awkward. The game feels like it was made for Gameboy and ported to mouse and keyboard. \\n\\n2. Generic story with trope characters and boring dialogue\\nI really have nothing good to say about the story. I don't like these characters and reading their talk is painful. I dread the moments before or after every mission where I have to stop the part of the game that's actually fun to watch the characters say the most generic lines at each other like they're reading from an AI generated YA novel. \\n\\n3. Poorly thought out systems and annoying RNG\\nYou know how in older tactics games like FF tactics, older Fire Emblems, ect. you could accidentally ruin a character's stat growth by leveling them in a low tier class too much? Or by shifting them across sub-optimal classes? Well they've brought that back, baby!\\nNot only that but you can be severely affected by what's available at the shop at any given moment. If you randomly get the option to buy a rogue with scavenger after the first mission you can change your name to Jeff Bezos, because now you're going to be obscenely, immorally, and baldly wealthy. There's a lot of other great or terrible things the shop might give you and save scumming is a constant temptation. Oh and there's also the thing where you have to watch support dialogues that seem to do nothing. Fire Emblem had support systems built into the tactics layer but this game doesn't seem to do anything with character relationships so I guess it's just here to torture me with more terrible dialogue. No matter the reward I question if it's worth it. \\n\\n4. Various clashing art styles \\nIt would have been fine if they just picked one, but the combat sprites, field sprites, and character portraits don't fit with each other. Really, I think the portraits are the weakest link here. \\n\\n\\nNeutral\\n1. The tactics gameplay is a mixed bag\\nOn the one hand you have that cool mechanic with unit formations, but aside from that it's just Fire Emblem, almost to a fault. Worse, the AI is not clever. It doesn't understand what the most logical move would be most turns. It sometimes kills its ranged units on your ranged units instead of taking potshots at your melee units. I think this is because the AI doesn't recognize what attacks will result in retaliation and just targets the squishiest unit it sees. \\n\\n2. It's probably nostalgic for some people\\nThis game openly and heavily borrows from old tactics games, especially Fire Emblem and Battle for Wesnoth. It feels very familiar down to the limited potential for resources, character classes, mission target turn rewards, between mission character conversations, and pretty much everything else really. For some this will be a positive, but for me it just felt generic.\\n\\nLooking at this list, it's a lot of cons just to experience the neat squad mechanics, but I see why some tactics fans seem to love it. Unless you're hungry for an old school tactics game like Fire Emblem on PC, I'd skip it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Symphony bills itself as a tactics game, and harps on the importance of utilizing tactics in battle, but the mechanics don't lend themselves to that end. For example, cavalry are unimpeded by hills or terrain such as woods, meaning that they can simply charge through what should be movement impediments and attack your ambush troops with ease. That's inane - cavalry should be punished severely for fighting in unsuitable terrain. Heavy armor units should also be at a severe disadvantage when fighting in unsuitable terrain against light units. Also, if a unit is capable of performing ambush attacks, why can't it hide in the appropriate terrain? Why is the damn thing still visible? Some ambush.\\n\\nThere is little to no information, save what is provided in text blocks during tutorials or the game's encyclopedia, about the properties of all terrain tiles. Even the entries there are woefully incomplete and inadequate. What constitutes 'rough terrain'? Anything but grasslands? Is a wheat field rough terrain? What are the properties of swamps? Do forests grant added protection against arrows (they should)? Do hills do something besides provide 1 more range unit to ranged attacks (they should, such as increased defense)? This means it's first and foremost an RPG - NOT a tactical game - where stats are more significant than any sort of tactical capability.\\n\\nSpeaking of the woefully inadequate game encyclopedia, it is missing explanations for a slew of status effects or further information for properly triggering charge and ambush attacks - sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. There's no explanation as to why - according to the cavalry unit description if I move maximum range (or 6 tiles) before attacking an enemy I should get a charge attack. It also contains just blatantly incorrect information. For example, it states that siege cannon take up two tiles when they simply don't. \\n\\nThen there are the mission objectives and extra objectives. Mission objectives need to be met in order to finish a map. Some of them are simply stupid - for example, the swamp monastery map. The objective is to get your protagonist's unit to a particular tile to end the mission. However, I had completely destroyed all enemy units, including reinforcements. I still had to waste several turns moving the protagonist unit to the specific tile in order to end the mission. The extra objectives grant you extra faction experience if completed. They include things such as ensuring that allied units survive. However, the allied AI (and enemy AI, for that matter) are utterly brain-dead. For example, allied cavalry units consistently charged to their deaths against enemy units filled with pikemen and crossbowmen. One of the side objectives was to ensure no more than 2 of these cavalry units died. Of course I failed the objective due to their insanely suicidal and cavalier (heh) attitude toward life. Failing that objective was not on me - it was on the developers for coding cavalry units to blindly charge to their deaths against units specifically designed to destroy them. What sort of idiot commanders did the allies hire?\\n\\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with any of this, and the game is fun to play in order to level up different troop types and see how they function. My issue is - don't claim that tactics are relevant when you don't even take basic terrain factors into consideration, the AI is brain-dead and suicidal, and you give the player super units who can unga-bunga their way through an enemy force by simply being present.\\n\\nEdit: 6/13/2022 (Note that today's patch may have addressed some of the issues above)\\nOther problems include certain tactics not working correctly. Zone of Control has no effect, as enemy units can still move full speed past my units.\\n\\nMagic is apparently less effective when used 'consecutively', so I'm assuming that means if a healer uses a healing spell twice in a row it is less effective. Is that if used on a single unit, or just twice in general? Is that per caster, or for your army overall over the course of a turn?\\n\\nThe morale system is silly. You can kill a squad's leader, utterly destroy the squad except for two archers or two casters (who will get wrecked without any covering units), and they still might have a low to nil chance of surrendering, regardless of the size or composition of the unit attempting the surrender. Two unarmored casters out in the open getting attacked by a full squad of heavily armored knights? Nope, no surrender, their morale is still 'fair'. C'mon, that's just stupid.\\n\\nEdit 2.0:\\n\\nChapter 12 is stupidly long and boring, and consists of you watching an overwhelming amount of enemy units move around. I guess the benefit is you can try to take as many out as possible to farm XP for your units. Honestly, they should've ended the chapter so I didn't have to waste an hour of my life watching the enemy army shuffle about, waiting for them to kill me.\\n\\nEscort mission. This map is pure RNG - if you can luckily one shot whole squads as they ram themselves to death against you, great! Otherwise, quickload. No one likes escort missions, especially when the AI is brain-dead and is only set to run to an objective, not avoid enemy units. It's like babysitting a lemming and trying to ensure it doesn't run off a cliff every five seconds. \\n \\nEnemy super units. You spend quite a few chapters avoiding, or running from, enemy super units that can one shot an entire squad. The devs fall back on this mechanic far too often. Boring and trite design.\\n\\nValkyries. They're an utterly useless Tier 3, suffering from a massive identity crisis. They lack the healing power of a Tier 2 mounted healer (despite the game specifically saying they have the healing capability of a hospitaller, lol) and the attack power of a knight, making them pointless and a waste of a slot. You'll keep your mounted healers at Tier 2 if you want them to be effective. The class needs a mechanics re-work to be useful.\\n\\nFlying units can't fly over walls in certain maps that they can fly over in other maps (lol why? You're artificially limiting my \"tactical\" options). They also can't move or stop on certain tiles with no rhyme or reason - for example, where mountains meet plains. They also move more slowly than cavalry. What's the point then?\\n\\nStun is useless when ambushing - it applies to the missed attack due to the ambush, not the attack the enemy actually gets to take. \\n\\nWhat is this game's obsession with water units? Water unit recruits, water units in my starting squads, water units in recruited squads... water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink.\\n\\nTerrible map design - move a turn, bait minimal enemy units with heavy to soak, punish with light / ambush troops, repeat ad nauseam. Some maps are designed with enemy light ambush / stealth attack units already situated in rough terrain. There is nothing you can do to avoid this - you have to bait and soak the damage with heavy units. These maps typically have Donari temples past the rough terrain with enemy ambush units, as if the devs knew they set up the map to screw you.\\n\\nIf you don't recruit as many units as possible early on you'll get severely hosed later in the game. Late-game recruits, including uniques, have horrid stat spreads that don't match their level, regardless of affinity. You'll see level 40 units with 30s and 40s in their primary class stats, making them worthless.\\n\\nI can see now with getting deeper into the game the devs spent too much time trying to craft a narrative instead of focusing on game design. The narrative they did craft is rife with spelling errors, at that. What a disappointment - if I want a good story I'll read a book or join in on a TTRPG, not play a video game. I'm here for the tactical combat, not what your OC Donut Steel Amazonian mommy fetish paladin feels about Donar.\\n\\nI have no more room to express my dissatisfaction with this game.

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\\n\\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\\n\\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it's F2P i feel like it's gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\\n\\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I've gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn't a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\\n\\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn't a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren't.   \n",

tactical RPGs I was pretty excited. I played through the entire thing on normal, and before I posted this I also watched part of a friends play through on hard.\\n\\nThe overall mechanics are pretty standard tactics fare, although its hard to say how much they really affect the overall game-play. From a personal perspective I felt the game was too easy in the beginning and the difficulty in hard mode came from being more irritating than tactical. \\n\\nThe real problem with the game is the story and writing. It feels like the plot was written by Asylum Films - a facade of a game story that's just aping other tactics games . They knew what story beats SHOULD be in the game, but not how to make them interesting or how to get from one to another naturally. Each time something would happen I kept hoping that this was going to be change or twist, but it takes the worst option at any turn. SPOILERS: [spoiler] The main character dies but then turns out to be fantasy Jesus, his childhood friend turns out to be the long lost king of a nation, You get betrayed by your friend but it is IMMEDIATELY resolved and has no relevance, etc. [/spoiler]\\n\\nThe romances are even worse. There's almost no lead up to any of them, and most of the characters have at max 1 conversation before falling in love, and then they rarely if ever say anything afterward. A lot of the dialogue gives off weird incel vibes too:\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/uPfhFIW\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/8fkEyKZ\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/rZHfYkz\\n\\nA lot of the writing also felt like someone's fetish material. SPOILERS: [spoiler] Diana, one of the main characters, starts out wearing plate mail (although it has boobs), then gets a costume change where she grows super huge and starts wearing a leotard. [/spoiler]\\nSPOILERS: https://imgur.com/tZneDcc\\n\\nIn summary, while the game is fine the story and writing actually drag it down. A day or so after finishing it I'm basically left feeling disappointed.   \n",

game's \"normal\" difficulty is a joke. I'm 4 hours in and I literally don't think it's possible to lose while using the default squad setups the game gives me. Your guys are walking gods while the enemy squads are jokes.\\n\\nThe \"hard\" difficulty is insanely frustrating, as losing high level units permanently because the AI randomly happened to focus them down is not fun unless you really love save scumming.\\n\\nThere's no proper challenge here, so there's no point in playing this. It's a real shame too because I like the the systems and the writing is surprisingly solid.   \n",

game.\\nThe systems are all good, but the game should really be five times longer to justify their existence. Really the game should be longer and broader to justify everything.\\n\\nThe whole game feels like a tutorial level for what you will one day do with the skill system and item system, then its over. All the character interactions feel inhuman and flat because you only interact with each character some pitifully low amount of times, leaving them no space to be interesting.\\n\\nIt feels like a pitch more than a game. Which is to say everything there is good, theres just not enough of any of it in a bad way. So strange bad review in that i would likely buy their next game based entirely on the promise in this title (though i would try a demo first this time).   \n",

Creating unit formations is awesome\\nThis is probably the biggest contribution the game has brought to the tactics genre. Instead of controlling 1 person per square, you control a formation of units per a square. When these squads face off, their formations dictate how the engagement will work. I like this mechanic. I played the game for hours longer than I otherwise would have because I wanted to see what kind of weird squads I could make. \\n\\n2. Music is fine.\\nFor real, it's decent music.\\n\\nCons\\n1. Terrible UI and controls\\nInformation you need to make decisions is not available in locations where it would be most useful. For instance, the organize squads screen doesn't have squad capacity shown until you click deeper into that menu. You cannot see if an enemy squad has ranged units at a glance, either. Finding or doing anything is several extra clicks away than it needs to be. It is all very playable but it gets quite annoying. Also the mouse controls feel awkward. The game feels like it was made for Gameboy and ported to mouse and keyboard. \\n\\n2. Generic story with trope characters and boring dialogue\\nI really have nothing good to say about the story. I don't like these characters and reading their talk is painful. I dread the moments before or after every mission where I have to stop the part of the game that's actually fun to watch the characters say the most generic lines at each other like they're reading from an AI generated YA novel. \\n\\n3. Poorly thought out systems and annoying RNG\\nYou know how in older tactics games like FF tactics, older Fire Emblems, ect. you could accidentally ruin a character's stat growth by leveling them in a low tier class too much? Or by shifting them across sub-optimal classes? Well they've brought that back, baby!\\nNot only that but you can be severely affected by what's available at the shop at any given moment. If you randomly get the option to buy a rogue with scavenger after the first mission you can change your name to Jeff Bezos, because now you're going to be obscenely, immorally, and baldly wealthy. There's a lot of other great or terrible things the shop might give you and save scumming is a constant temptation. Oh and there's also the thing where you have to watch support dialogues that seem to do nothing. Fire Emblem had support systems built into the tactics layer but this game doesn't seem to do anything with character relationships so I guess it's just here to torture me with more terrible dialogue. No matter the reward I question if it's worth it. \\n\\n4. Various clashing art styles \\nIt would have been fine if they just picked one, but the combat sprites, field sprites, and character portraits don't fit with each other. Really, I think the portraits are the weakest link here. \\n\\n\\nNeutral\\n1. The tactics gameplay is a mixed bag\\nOn the one hand you have that cool mechanic with unit formations, but aside from that it's just Fire Emblem, almost to a fault. Worse, the AI is not clever. It doesn't understand what the most logical move would be most turns. It sometimes kills its ranged units on your ranged units instead of taking potshots at your melee units. I think this is because the AI doesn't recognize what attacks will result in retaliation and just targets the squishiest unit it sees. \\n\\n2. It's probably nostalgic for some people\\nThis game openly and heavily borrows from old tactics games, especially Fire Emblem and Battle for Wesnoth. It feels very familiar down to the limited potential for resources, character classes, mission target turn rewards, between mission character conversations, and pretty much everything else really. For some this will be a positive, but for me it just felt generic.\\n\\nLooking at this list, it's a lot of cons just to experience the neat squad mechanics, but I see why some tactics fans seem to love it. Unless you're hungry for an old school tactics game like Fire Emblem on PC, I'd skip it.   \n",
       "9466  Symphony bills itself as a tactics game, and harps on the importance of utilizing tactics in battle, but the mechanics don't lend themselves to that end. For example, cavalry are unimpeded by hills or terrain such as woods, meaning that they can simply charge through what should be movement impediments and attack your ambush troops with ease. That's inane - cavalry should be punished severely for fighting in unsuitable terrain. Heavy armor units should also be at a severe disadvantage when fighting in unsuitable terrain against light units. Also, if a unit is capable of performing ambush attacks, why can't it hide in the appropriate terrain? Why is the damn thing still visible? Some ambush.\\n\\nThere is little to no information, save what is provided in text blocks during tutorials or the game's encyclopedia, about the properties of all terrain tiles. Even the entries there are woefully incomplete and inadequate. What constitutes 'rough terrain'? Anything but grasslands? Is a wheat field rough terrain? What are the properties of swamps? Do forests grant added protection against arrows (they should)? Do hills do something besides provide 1 more range unit to ranged attacks (they should, such as increased defense)? This means it's first and foremost an RPG - NOT a tactical game - where stats are more significant than any sort of tactical capability.\\n\\nSpeaking of the woefully inadequate game encyclopedia, it is missing explanations for a slew of status effects or further information for properly triggering charge and ambush attacks - sometimes they work, sometimes they don't. There's no explanation as to why - according to the cavalry unit description if I move maximum range (or 6 tiles) before attacking an enemy I should get a charge attack. It also contains just blatantly incorrect information. For example, it states that siege cannon take up two tiles when they simply don't. \\n\\nThen there are the mission objectives and extra objectives. Mission objectives need to be met in order to finish a map. Some of them are simply stupid - for example, the swamp monastery map. The objective is to get your protagonist's unit to a particular tile to end the mission. However, I had completely destroyed all enemy units, including reinforcements. I still had to waste several turns moving the protagonist unit to the specific tile in order to end the mission. The extra objectives grant you extra faction experience if completed. They include things such as ensuring that allied units survive. However, the allied AI (and enemy AI, for that matter) are utterly brain-dead. For example, allied cavalry units consistently charged to their deaths against enemy units filled with pikemen and crossbowmen. One of the side objectives was to ensure no more than 2 of these cavalry units died. Of course I failed the objective due to their insanely suicidal and cavalier (heh) attitude toward life. Failing that objective was not on me - it was on the developers for coding cavalry units to blindly charge to their deaths against units specifically designed to destroy them. What sort of idiot commanders did the allies hire?\\n\\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with any of this, and the game is fun to play in order to level up different troop types and see how they function. My issue is - don't claim that tactics are relevant when you don't even take basic terrain factors into consideration, the AI is brain-dead and suicidal, and you give the player super units who can unga-bunga their way through an enemy force by simply being present.\\n\\nEdit: 6/13/2022 (Note that today's patch may have addressed some of the issues above)\\nOther problems include certain tactics not working correctly. Zone of Control has no effect, as enemy units can still move full speed past my units.\\n\\nMagic is apparently less effective when used 'consecutively', so I'm assuming that means if a healer uses a healing spell twice in a row it is less effective. Is that if used on a single unit, or just twice in general? Is that per caster, or for your army overall over the course of a turn?\\n\\nThe morale system is silly. You can kill a squad's leader, utterly destroy the squad except for two archers or two casters (who will get wrecked without any covering units), and they still might have a low to nil chance of surrendering, regardless of the size or composition of the unit attempting the surrender. Two unarmored casters out in the open getting attacked by a full squad of heavily armored knights? Nope, no surrender, their morale is still 'fair'. C'mon, that's just stupid.\\n\\nEdit 2.0:\\n\\nChapter 12 is stupidly long and boring, and consists of you watching an overwhelming amount of enemy units move around. I guess the benefit is you can try to take as many out as possible to farm XP for your units. Honestly, they should've ended the chapter so I didn't have to waste an hour of my life watching the enemy army shuffle about, waiting for them to kill me.\\n\\nEscort mission. This map is pure RNG - if you can luckily one shot whole squads as they ram themselves to death against you, great! Otherwise, quickload. No one likes escort missions, especially when the AI is brain-dead and is only set to run to an objective, not avoid enemy units. It's like babysitting a lemming and trying to ensure it doesn't run off a cliff every five seconds. \\n \\nEnemy super units. You spend quite a few chapters avoiding, or running from, enemy super units that can one shot an entire squad. The devs fall back on this mechanic far too often. Boring and trite design.\\n\\nValkyries. They're an utterly useless Tier 3, suffering from a massive identity crisis. They lack the healing power of a Tier 2 mounted healer (despite the game specifically saying they have the healing capability of a hospitaller, lol) and the attack power of a knight, making them pointless and a waste of a slot. You'll keep your mounted healers at Tier 2 if you want them to be effective. The class needs a mechanics re-work to be useful.\\n\\nFlying units can't fly over walls in certain maps that they can fly over in other maps (lol why? You're artificially limiting my \"tactical\" options). They also can't move or stop on certain tiles with no rhyme or reason - for example, where mountains meet plains. They also move more slowly than cavalry. What's the point then?\\n\\nStun is useless when ambushing - it applies to the missed attack due to the ambush, not the attack the enemy actually gets to take. \\n\\nWhat is this game's obsession with water units? Water unit recruits, water units in my starting squads, water units in recruited squads... water, water, everywhere, and not a drop to drink.\\n\\nTerrible map design - move a turn, bait minimal enemy units with heavy to soak, punish with light / ambush troops, repeat ad nauseam. Some maps are designed with enemy light ambush / stealth attack units already situated in rough terrain. There is nothing you can do to avoid this - you have to bait and soak the damage with heavy units. These maps typically have Donari temples past the rough terrain with enemy ambush units, as if the devs knew they set up the map to screw you.\\n\\nIf you don't recruit as many units as possible early on you'll get severely hosed later in the game. Late-game recruits, including uniques, have horrid stat spreads that don't match their level, regardless of affinity. You'll see level 40 units with 30s and 40s in their primary class stats, making them worthless.\\n\\nI can see now with getting deeper into the game the devs spent too much time trying to craft a narrative instead of focusing on game design. The narrative they did craft is rife with spelling errors, at that. What a disappointment - if I want a good story I'll read a book or join in on a TTRPG, not play a video game. I'm here for the tactical combat, not what your OC Donut Steel Amazonian mommy fetish paladin feels about Donar.\\n\\nI have no more room to express my dissatisfaction with this game. It's BAD.   \n",

information properly triggering charge ambush attacks sometimes work sometimes explanation according cavalry unit description move maximum range tiles attacking enemy get charge attack also contains blatantly incorrect information example states siege cannon take two tiles simply mission objectives extra objectives mission objectives need met order finish map simply stupid example swamp monastery map objective get protagonist unit particular tile end mission however completely destroyed enemy units including reinforcements still waste several turns moving protagonist unit specific tile order end mission extra objectives grant extra faction experience completed include things ensuring allied units survive however allied enemy matter utterly brain dead example allied cavalry units consistently charged deaths enemy units filled pikemen crossbowmen one side objectives ensure cavalry units died course failed objective due insanely suicidal cavalier heh attitude toward life failing

types see function issue claim tactics relevant even take basic terrain factors consideration brain dead suicidal give player super units unga bunga way enemy force simply present edit note today patch may addressed issues problems include certain tactics working correctly zone control effect enemy units still move full speed past units magic apparently less effective used consecutively assuming means healer uses healing spell twice row less effective used single unit twice general per caster army overall course turn morale system silly kill squad leader utterly destroy squad except two archers two casters get wrecked without covering units still might low nil chance surrendering regardless size composition unit attempting surrender two unarmored casters open getting attacked full squad heavily armored knights nope surrender morale still fair mon stupid edit chapter stupidly long boring consists watching overwhelming amount enemy units move around guess benefit try take

running enemy super units one shot entire squad devs fall back mechanic far often boring trite design valkyries utterly useless tier suffering massive identity crisis lack healing power tier mounted healer despite game specifically saying healing capability hospitaller lol attack power knight making pointless waste slot keep mounted healers tier want effective class needs mechanics work useful flying units fly walls certain maps fly maps lol artificially limiting tactical options also move stop certain tiles rhyme reason example mountains meet plains also move slowly cavalry point stun

controller instead keyboard mouse plan use controller know little bit frustrating many extra clicks anything certain information behind clicks gameplay main thing game addictive srpite map represents squad squad size limited leader leadership example leadership capacity soldier costs capacity higher tier capacity takes soldier gain experience class points experience raises stats class points allow change class reach certain ammount change class many times want long gather enough points change class linear might want upgrade fighter archer rogue squirmicher mounted scout apprentice etc choose scout get upgraded hussar ranger branching choice squads equiped artifact unlock possibility equip artifacts artifacts weapons armor etc wich raise certain stats give abilities example damage soldiers first row also items earn buy use individual soldiers giving change soldiers affinity earth fire light etc even traits example executioner enemy soldier chance get extra turn really lot tinker army choice different soldiers disposition grid class upgrades items artifacts relationships friend bonded status might give extra abilities much changed actually change squad fights role battlefield matter damage actually change tactics always anxious try see results battlefield find really cool synergies specially able bigger squads let fact get tier soldiers reach middle game make thing evolution progress stagnate game really chapter map chapters story short cut scenes never felt dull wanting skip menu organize army access tech tree also opens new abilities features marketplace recruit buy sell items artifacts resources also relationship screen couple conversations characters might appear lead friedships even romantic bonds nothing special romantic part seriously underdevloped almost like token end get words main characters reached character bonded even mention anything nothing happened story gets things going done nothing special nothing really boring unlike mercenaries series tactical games end skipping scenes battles enjoyed game much hours time review played last days one days went bed hooked let finally finished drag also feel short certainyl looking

tactics genre instead controlling person per square control formation units per square squads face formations dictate engagement work like mechanic played game hours longer otherwise would wanted see kind weird squads could make music fine real decent music cons terrible controls information need make decisions available locations would useful instance organize squads screen squad capacity shown click deeper menu cannot see enemy squad ranged units glance either finding anything several extra clicks away needs playable gets quite annoying also mouse controls feel awkward game feels like made gameboy ported mouse keyboard generic story trope characters boring dialogue really nothing good say story like characters reading talk painful dread moments every mission stop part game actually fun watch characters say generic lines like reading generated novel poorly thought systems annoying rng know older tactics games like tactics older fire emblems ect could accidentally ruin character stat growth leveling low tier class much shifting across sub optimal classes well brought back baby severely affected available shop given moment randomly get option buy rogue scavenger first mission change name jeff bezos going obscenely immorally baldly wealthy lot great terrible things shop might give save scumming constant temptation also thing watch support dialogues seem nothing fire emblem support systems built tactics layer game seem anything character relationships guess torture terrible dialogue matter reward question worth various clashing art styles would fine picked one combat sprites field sprites character portraits fit really think portraits weakest link neutral tactics gameplay mixed bag one hand cool mechanic unit formations aside fire emblem almost fault worse clever understand logical move would turns sometimes kills ranged units ranged units instead taking potshots melee units think recognize attacks result retaliation targets squishiest unit sees probably nostalgic people game openly heavily borrows old tactics games especially fire emblem battle wesnoth feels familiar limited potential resources character classes mission target turn rewards mission character conversations pretty much everything else really positive felt generic looking list lot cons experience neat squad mechanics see tactics fans seem love unless hungry old school tactics game

increased defense means first foremost rpg tactical game stats significant sort tactical capability speaking woefully inadequate game encyclopedia missing explanations slew status effects information properly triggering charge ambush attacks sometimes work sometimes explanation according cavalry unit description move maximum range tiles attacking enemy get charge attack also contains blatantly incorrect information example states siege cannon take two tiles simply mission objectives extra objectives mission objectives need met order finish map simply stupid example swamp monastery map objective get protagonist unit particular tile end mission however completely destroyed enemy units including reinforcements still waste several turns moving protagonist unit specific tile order end mission extra objectives grant extra faction experience completed include things ensuring allied units survive however allied enemy matter utterly brain dead example allied cavalry units consistently charged deaths enemy units filled pikemen crossbowmen one side objectives ensure cavalry units died course failed objective due insanely suicidal cavalier heh attitude toward life failing objective developers coding cavalry units blindly charge deaths units specifically designed destroy sort idiot commanders allies hire nothing inherently wrong game fun play order level different troop types see

addressed issues problems include certain tactics working correctly zone control effect enemy units still move full speed past units magic apparently less effective used consecutively assuming means healer uses healing spell twice row less effective used single unit twice general per caster army overall course turn morale system silly kill squad leader utterly destroy squad except two archers two casters get wrecked without covering units still might low nil chance surrendering regardless size composition unit attempting surrender two unarmored casters open getting attacked full squad heavily armored knights nope surrender morale still fair mon stupid edit chapter stupidly long boring consists watching overwhelming amount enemy units move around guess benefit try take many possible farm

missions especially brain dead set run objective avoid enemy units like babysitting lemming trying ensure run cliff every five seconds enemy super units spend quite chapters avoiding running enemy super units one shot entire squad devs fall back mechanic far often boring trite design valkyries utterly useless tier suffering massive identity crisis lack healing power tier mounted healer despite game specifically saying healing capability hospitaller lol attack power knight making pointless waste slot keep mounted healers tier want effective class needs mechanics work useful flying units fly
