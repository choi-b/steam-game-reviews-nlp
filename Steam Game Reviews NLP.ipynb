       "  'review': '[h1]A dream for every Potterhead and those who want to become one![/h1]\\n[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]\\n\\n\\nSometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don\\'t even get me started with license games in general....\\n\\nHogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.\\n\\nI don\\'t usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of \"Harry Potter\" made me buy it in an instant.\\n\\nThe following review won\\'t contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.\\n\\n[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won\\'t be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613\\n\\n\\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\\nSo far so good. It starts off with a generic \"You are the chosen one!\" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don\\'t want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn\\'t be able to stop reading it until the very end.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nOverwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.\\n\\nFirst off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.\\n\\nThen you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.\\n\\nAlso: You don\\'t get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.\\n\\nIf you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the \"Floo powder\" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  \\n\\nDecorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Combat:[/h1]\\n\\nWhat would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. \\n\\nFighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. \\n\\nFor your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can\\'t really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.\\nThe further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.\\n\\nAs a sidenote: You also don\\'t need to fight most of the time, if you don\\'t want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]\\n\\nThere is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don\\'t really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn\\'t fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.\\nI just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]\\n\\nJust wow!  \\nHogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don\\'t even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]\\n\\nI play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won\\'t be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]\\n\\nSimply magical!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8\\nI also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!\\n\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]You know you want it! For me it is already GOTY. Not a single game in the last months kept me so occupied. Now if you excuse me I have to collect more things for my potions and maybe get lost on my way in a random ruin hunting for treasure.[/u]',\n",

       "  'review': \"So I have finished my first playthrough of the game, have put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.\\n\\nPersonally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. \\n\\nThe story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.\\n\\nI have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.\\n\\nOutside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Updated Review as of 35 hours combined total.  I wanted to add a few more thoughts.\\n\\nMy daughter who is closing in on 18, and my half century year old self have both been fans of Harry Potter and the Wizarding World. I read the books to her when she was younger and then on my own. We’ve watched the movies and it has always been great bonding for us.\\n\\nI preordered the Deluxe edition on Steam when it first came available. I knew my Desktop would handle it but had some concerns about the Steam Deck which has become my device of choice to game on when I feel up to it health wise. Luckily it got Steam Deck Verified before early launch.\\n\\nDuring early launch we spent about about 10 hours into the game. I put a couple hours in on my Steam Deck with no issues and it ran a solid 30 FPS except the very sparse drop to mid to high 20s on some cutscenes. Note that I made no changes to the stock installation settings. Also note that I play in performance mode as I am plugged in while in bed or on the sofa 99% of my playtime. My daughter had about 8 on our primary desktop which is an aging i5-7400 @ 3Ghz, 16GB RAM, SSD with a GeForce 1060 GTX and reported no issues either.\\n\\nAt this point we have over 35 hours in with the majority of them being my daughter on the PC and me making up about a third of the remaining hours on the Deck. During those hours we each experienced one crash. For her it was a CTD for myself it was a crash that locked up Proton causing a force restart of the switch. Note both of these crashes were prior to the Day 1 patch and we haven’t ran into any further issues since.\\n\\nGameplay is fun and a lot more interesting and in-depth than I expected. Learning the various arts like potion making, herbalism, and so long always gives you something to do. I am known for almost always turning off in game music but the soundtrack is perfect for reminding you what world you are in. There are more than enough side quests to keep you busy, to the point of falling behind and losing track of the main quest.\\n\\nThere are puzzles at every turn that are both hard but not impossible. I have yet to have to refer to a walkthrough as much as at times I wanted to. This game really keeps you wanting to avoid spoilers and accomplish things on your own. You will meet a lot of classmates and others on and off campus, however there is really a fairly limited pool that you regularly interact with. That said you will quickly make close friends and even your own Draco Malfoy types who you will hate but might end up have a truce with.\\n\\nAll in all my daughter and my biggest complaint is the lack of better character customization. There are a fair number of presets but there is no ability to adjust outside those presets such as adjust lips or cheeks, noses to your own design outside the presets slider. There is no hight or weight adjustment. I like the amount of control over skin tones and as mentioned there are a fair amount of sliders.\\n\\nHowever by modern standards it’s barebones. It’s sad when I have played phone f2p games that have better character creation when you can only really only see your character at the selection screen than a $70-90 USD that everyone is going to want to go all out on character design. It is for this primary reason along with my dislike of how hard on the Deck and I assume PC selection of Foo Flame travel points is harder than it should be. I watched my daughter do fast travel via KVM and it was smooth as could be. I do so on the deck and I eventually give up and fly or walk there.\\n\\nThat said we still rate this game a very strong 9/10 and already call it GOTY for us.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[b]For me this is one of best Open World game, I've ever played.[/b]\\n\\n[b]Storyline - 9/10[/b]\\nStory is presented in a very nice form like in Harry Poter movies. In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. We also have riddle games and good sidequests.\\n\\n[b]Gameplay - 9/10[/b]\\nBeautiful open world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore Hogwart, caves, forests, mountains and doing much more things. The map is very large. Herbalism and Alchemy are important and helps a lot, we also can upgrade equipments. We can have a real wizzard adventure. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.\\n\\n[b]Characters - 10/10[/b]\\nEach character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We also can choose the path of the main character be good wizzard or bad (unforgivable spells) but the game won't punish us for it.\\n\\n[b]Graphics - 10/10[/b]\\nGraphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water, clouds are very well refined. We can see falling leaves, changing weather. It makes a huge impression.\\n\\n[b]Sounds - 9/10[/b]\\nMusic and ambient sounds in this game fits great. We can listen climatic music which is selected for each moment of the game. Character voices are not my favourite but it fits into character. There is a lot of music known from the movies.\\n\\n[b]Overall - 9.5/10[/b]\\nIf you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game. This is well made game not only for Harry Potters fans, but for everyone.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Hogwarts Legacy is a great game, very polished by today's standards in my opinion. But it is lacking in some small areas. Below I have listed the pros and cons of the game. I also listed what I want to see in the future, as well as what I don't want to see in the future! Keep in mind I am not a massive Harry Potter fan and only have seen the movies a long time ago. This list was made over the course of my playthrough during the 72 hour early access for Deluxe Editon owners, hopefully there is a day 1 patch out by now! Enjoy!\\n\\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\\n• Good Performance (Could be better, but it is very good at least for me)\\n• Great Immersion\\n• Graphics and Art Style\\n• Changing Seasons\\n• Fancy Animation (With spells, puzzles, doors, and all that)\\n• Great Music & Sound Design (Broom class kinda popped off with that music)\\n• Engaging Story/Narrative\\n• Fun Late Game Combat (Ancient magic is sick! Just use your spells and mix it up! It's pretty fun)\\n• Exploration (Rewards you heavily for it)\\n• Detailed & Big World (You can go into any building, find many secrets, solve fun puzzles, pet cats, and much more)\\n• Interesting Characters (There are lots! The voice acting is sometimes bad)\\n• Great Transmog (Once you get the item you keep its appearance for use whenever you want)\\n• Great Quests (There are a ton)\\n• Fun Skins/Outfits (Great outfit pieces, mount skins, wand skins, and all that)\\n• Almost No Bugs (Visual bugs only, most are funny)\\n• No Crashes\\n• Accessibility & UI Options (There are LOTS!)\\n• Graphic Options (Also LOTS!) \\n• NPC Quest Speed (WOW, NPCs that actually move your speed on quests?! More games should do this!)\\n• Room of Requirement (Fun to customize, can be daunting at times)\\n\\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\\n• No Quidditch\\n• Cramped Camera (Sometimes it can be at weird angles, maybe add customizable positions)\\n• Character Customization (I'm referring to the customization at the start of the game, it's a bit iffy)\\n• Voice Pitch (In the character customization menu at the start, every voice pitch besides the default one sounds robotic)\\n• Voice Acting (Sometimes)\\n• Repetitive Early Game Combat (Not a lot of spells to use but it's understandable)\\n• Limited Gear Slots (Can be increased by doing [spoiler]Merlin Trials[/spoiler])\\n• Confusing Menu (At first, it was hard for me to get used to it all at once, I couldn't find transmog or my Twitch drops)\\n• Useless Houses (From what I have played your house doesn't mean much)\\n• Useless Wands (When choosing your wand, the attributes don't do anything from what I have seen, from a game standpoint it makes sense)\\n• Small Enemy/Boss Variety ([spoiler]All 4 trials are the same, etc[/spoiler])\\n• Graphical Stuttering (In cutscenes mostly, sometimes happens when entering newly rendered areas)\\n• Lighting Transitions & Flickering (Sometimes the lighting can be blinding, or just straight up weird looking)\\n• Door Loading (When traversing the castle, sometimes the game will show a loading icon on doors)\\n• Robot Background NPCs (They pretty much don't do anything but walk and talk, with no reactions to spells or anything)\\n• NPC AI & Animations (Sometimes it's a bit janky)\\n\\n[h1]What I Want to See:[/h1]\\n• Multiplayer (At least Quidditch multiplayer)\\n• Mod Support (Would be awesome, especially Steam Workshop)\\n• Quidditch (They have the Golden Snitch and the arena in-game already)\\n• Camera Control (Positioning, maybe increased FOV slider?)\\n• Photo Mode (Please!)\\n• Better Character Customization (More skin colors, hair, face shapes, and more)\\n• Improved Voice Pitch (Better pitch shifter)\\n• Improved Voice Acting (Most likely will not happen)\\n• Bug Fixes (Lighting transition fixes)\\n• Better Performance (Door loading improvements)\\n• More Accessibility Options (Arachnophobia switch?)\\n• Community Engagement (Free in-game events to win cosmetics, community updates and more! Ex. Dying Light 2 is a game that does this VERY well!)\\n\\n[h1]What I Don’t Want to See:[/h1]\\n• Micro-transactions \\n• Overpriced DLC\\n• Radio Silence (No more updates, no communication, and all that. Would be a bummer)\\n\\nTo conclude, most of the cons can be fixed easily, don't let the cons bring you down. I believe most of the cons will be fixed/addressed. Anyways, here are my PC specs and I ran the game at 1440p with consistent 120 FPS at almost all times! No RTX on!\\n\\nCPU: Intel Core i9-12900K CPU @ 5.20GHz\\nGPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090\\nRAM: 32 GB DDR4 RAM\\nStorage: Installed on my 250 GB SSD\\nMonitor: Samsung Odyssey G7 1440p 240hz 27 Inch\",\n",

And that's fine, it doesn't have to be. \\n\\nFinally, for people who only care about what J.K.Rowling says on twitter... this game is not for you. Not due to anything in the game itself - it is actually very kind and inclusive and you *would enjoy it* - but because J.K.Rowling created the harry potter world ~30 years ago, you won't enjoy playing any game set in that world. That's fine. Please don't bully people online for enjoying things, and don't spread hate.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This game is a dream come true. I waited 20 years for this. I\\'m every second of this, the atention to detail is amazing. And sometimes you get the Skyrim vibes. The OST is amazing and pays tribute to John William\\'s with lots of variations from the OG.\\n\\nI gotta adress the elephant in the room tho: performance is not great. It boggles my mind that they chose to go with Unreal Engine 4 for a game of this magnitude, specially when one of WB\\'s own devs have an amazing engine \"Firebird\" from Monolith (used in Shadow of War), which these devs could have borrowed if WB wasn\\'t to give monolith the project for what reason may be (maybe because they are doing wonder-woman). My point is, UE4 is dated. It used single threaded performance so the 1% lows are disgusting and all over the place (12900K + 4090). The hardcoded TAA to mask the engine\\'s limits and rough edges is vomit inducing at times.\\n\\n2nd- Complaint: They should have gone further with this project. NPC colision and interaction specially inside the school. Day and night cicle is there but there is no mandatory curfew and no eating schedule and classes are not times. So it all feels off somehow. They should have gone with an aproach á lá Kingdom Come Deliverance on this imo.\\n\\nAlas, no game is perfect, maybe the potterhead in me makes turn a blind eye to all the shortcomings in this game, because when at its peak this game really does shine and any fan will have goosebumps. The wasted potential may be mitigated with mods as i already seen some mods on Nexus and there already a mod loader (btw, theres a mod to unlock all PS5 exclusive content but requires a new save to get the mission, but potion works regardless)\\n\\nAnd there you go. im sure im missing a lot of stuff, but i recomend this game for all fans, and to non fans who like a RPG lite, story driven game. 9/10',\n",

       "  'review': 'I was playing the game on another account and I have no reason to write a fake review or get paid for it, so calm down about game time\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[table]\\n[tr]\\n[th][b]MY RATING:[/b][/th]\\n[th][b] ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✘ [/b][/th]\\n[th][b]9 / 10[/b][/th]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\\n\\n[b]Hogwarts Legacy: a magical experience only for Harry Potter fans ?[/b]\\n\\nIn Hogwarts Legacy we play a new student who comes to magic school. As previously known, we start with the character in fifth grade and not as usual, as an eleven-year-old in the first year. And yes, as the story progresses it becomes clear why that is.\\n\\nThe main mission series, i.e. the core of the game, has been implemented flawlessly, is absolutely creative and not only takes place in the open world.\\n\\nI was really impressed with some of the things the developers came up with, especially towards the end of the main story.\\nIn addition, the cutscenes are graphically on film level and the story is told in an exciting and interesting way. Also, there is no shying away from death and violence and you experience a lot of fan service with attention to detail and only rarely does it get overly sentimental.\\n\\nThe character editor is solid but doesn\\'t allow for an excessive number of options. You can only select pre-made faces and characters. Unfortunately, there are no other personalization options. Therefore, the number of assets is also noticeable in the game because in the castle you always meet the same people or very similar ones. Basically, the castle is not overly busy and it is noticeable that grades one to four, six and seven are not available at all.\\nI can imagine that this is partly due to the fact that not so many character models should be designed and even more NPCs would probably have caused a stuttering orgy.\\nI also have the feeling that the character animations have been cut back a bit and there are some clipping errors. Basically, however, all character models are really pretty and the coats, scarves and capes are designed great, even if they quickly develop a life of their own when moving and flap around wildly. \\n\\n[b]It just looks really amazing[/b]\\n\\nIf you overlook the few little things, you get an absolutely beautiful game that can convince with both the graphics and the spectacular scenery. \\nThe faces look alive and you can read the emotions that go with what is happening, and the overall animation of the characters is very believable.\\nIn general, the world is very harmonious and you quickly feel at home. The areas in the castle are strongly inspired by the films and outside they have detached themselves more from them, but still made sure to create a world in which one likes to move.\\nYou can tell on every corner that the developers put their hearts into it and you constantly come across lovely details such as decorative objects, scattered lore and one or the other side quest.\\nAnd finally, the musical cherry on top of the sundae with cream.\\nThere\\'s no direct soundtrack from the films, but the music is pretty damn close and really, really good. I also liked the fact that there is no excessive continuous sound and the developers have found a good mix of when scenes are “bombastic” accompanied and when things should be a little quieter.\\n\\nThe overall result is a production that really convinced me and made me forget the real world for hours.\\n\\n[b]And there is so much to do[/b]\\n\\nThe main missions are quite varied and the game world changes as they progress. There are several seasons that change when you reach certain story moments. The side missions, on the other hand, are not tied to the seasons and therefore cannot be missed.\\nHowever, it can quickly become confusing in the quest menu if you only accept the challenges and never complete them.\\nAs far as the demands of the side missions are concerned, this varies greatly. \\nThere are classic \"boring\" collection tasks but also missions that lead you to hidden places that you probably wouldn\\'t have seen otherwise. \\nAnd for the fact that these are purely optional areas, some of them are really impressive. \\nIn the lessons, you can expect a wide variety of challenges depending on the subject. All the different types of teaching are all well implemented and the professors appear as believable personalities who take great care of us. After all, we have a lot of catching up to do and that happens with… exactly, homework. \\nSounds really bad, but it really isn\\'t because it loosens up the events for a while and there are additional magic rewards.\\nI think that with the spells, a lot of attention was paid to player friendliness, because there are almost no annoying elements and spells have a long range and there is no cooldown for them outside of combat. \\n\\n[b]To infinity and beyond[/b]\\n\\nFlying with the broom, which you unlock after a few hours of play and use constantly from then on, was also implemented very well. \\nThe controls work great and I\\'m really not a good flyer in such games. \\nYou\\'re fast in the open world and it feels great. The view you have is absolutely awesome and I like to fly a little longer instead of using fast travel. \\nA little less spectacular but somehow even cooler are the flying mounts that you unlock a little later. Basically, these do exactly the same thing as the broom, although they may seem a bit slower and don\\'t feel quite as agile, but there\\'s something absolutely epic about it compared to a magic broom. \\n\\n[b]Wrong place at the wrong time[/b]\\n\\nOf course you will have to fight too. And these are great fun.\\nWe have a standard spell, a block-counter mechanic, and the different spell classes. \\nEnemies create colored shields that can be countered with the right type of spell. \\nThe great thing is that each spell also has a unique ability and it\\'s not just the color coding that matters. This allows you to try different tactics and quickly develop your own magical fighting style. \\n\\n[b]And what about replay value and continued play value?[/b]\\n\\nThe game still has a replay value because the main quest is played differently in the different houses and the students react differently to it. \\nAnd since you often have the choice of how to decide, a second run is probably just as much fun because you can try out the unused dialogue options. Ultimately, however, it is up to each individual to what extent the passages then differ from one another.\\n\\nEven after the main story, it\\'s still worth playing because the final exam of the fifth grade is waiting for you. \\nSo there\\'s a good reason to keep zipping through Hogwarts after the credits roll, doing side quests and engaging in battles.\\n\\nThe game doesn\\'t reinvent the wheel and comparable fights, quests and open world tasks can be found in other games, but the creative and clever implementation of the story events in a video game design, coupled with the new game mechanics that are presented every few hours I was pleasantly and positively surprised. The game has many allusions to the Harry Potter world, but still has its own and new ideas that the developers turn into unforgettable game moments.\\n\\nReview date: February 11, 2023\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[b]MY PROS AND CONS:[/b]\\n\\n✔ long story campaign\\n✔ magical and enormously detailed game world\\n✔ atmospheric music\\n✔ great fights through magic combos\\n✔ lots to discover \\n✔ game mechanics clearly explained\\n✔ letters give backgrounds to the game world\\n✔ Harry Potter charm with lots of fan service\\n✔ interesting side missions and collection tasks\\n✔ world invites you to explore\\n✔ countless puzzles and mysteries\\n\\n✘ quite stiff facial animations\\n✘ no Morality System, Quidditch\\n✘ sometimes very artificial-looking dialogues\\n\\n[hr][/hr][b] PLAYED WITH: 🎮 📺  [/b]\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42616051/][b] ⮩ VISIT ME IN MY LITTLE WORLD[/b][/url]\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n[url] https://store.steampowered.com/app/990080/Hogwarts_Legacy/ [/url]',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Summary[/h1]\\nHogwarts Legacy is the best Harry Potter game to date, but as a game on its own merit, at its current price range, it leaves something to be desired. \\n\\nThis game is a [b]THUMBS UP[/b] for Harry Potter fans, or fans of the Witcher 3's combat and exploration. This game is very similar to the Witcher 3 in a LOT of ways, from the style of the combat, to the four equippable spells, to the repeating side-mission-esque puzzles and minor boss fights.\\n\\nFor everyone else, however, it's a thumbs down. For 60 euros, you're getting maybe 20-25 hours of actual content. The rest is copy+paste side-missions and exploration. Now, the team here has made a AMAZING environment, but its big heavy-hit is nostalgia. Without the nostalgia, the environment is impressive, but not nearly as much as it is for a fan of the series.\\n\\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Story[/b]\\nThe story is awful. I'm sorry, but I have to be honest here. It's so bland and childish it's kind of embarassing. And it leaks into the characters and conversations too. The protagonist literally massacres hundreds of dark wizards and goblins, as a 15 year old, and nobody, including themselves, bats an eye at this. The actual main plot is not explored nearly to the extent that I wish it was, instead giving you a moustache-twirling villain, with hopelessly under-explored motives.\\n\\nIf you're here looking for the magical story-telling of the books, RUN! It's not here!\\n\\nThis is really what ruins the game for me. As I will cover later, the game actually has good characters that I'd love to see more of, but you rarely see more than one of them at a time. You interact with them in the same way that a WoW character interacts with quest NPC's, and that's a real shame.\\n\\nWhat that means is that the main plot is mainly just you, the bland self-insert, doing literally everything. Sometimes another character is along, but it's just for the ride. You're the chosen one.\\n\\nThe combat is good, very good, but it's not THAT good.\\n\\nIn fact, the story ruins more than that, because it means that your main interaction with the beautiful environment is just... collectibles. The story utilises the awesome environment so little, in fact, often you are spirited away to completely separate mini-dungeons, where you then fight off boss-goons to advance.\\n\\nJust... why?\\n\\nOh yeah, and of course, the actual story is also super short, meaning you get very little content for your money. And replayability? Forget it. There are no decisions here. All playthroughs will be the same pretty much, especially if you try to complete your side-quests.\\n\\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\\n\\n[b]Side Characters[/b]\\nThe other characters fit well into the Harry Potter universe, without being carbon copies of book characters. In general, I found most of the characters pretty memorable. My favourite was Natty. I just thought she was nice.\\n\\nNone of the characters feel out place, and there is a pretty good selection of main characters to interact with. Sadly, only one of these characters really interacts that much with the main story, Professor Fig. He's the only one who is really there from start to finish, and even then only really as a mentor character. You really miss the shenanigans and shared adventures that the books portrayed. \\n\\nSadly, this just adds insult to the injury that is how they are used in the main story. I NEVER, not even ONCE, felt like I needed any of these characters. Except for teaching me a few spells, I, the main character, do EVERYTHING MYSELF. You don't get the feeling of complimenting talents like you do in the original series at all, it's just you against the goblin horde, assisted by Professor Fig who does boring study-stuff for you.\\n\\nWhat a waste!\\n\\n[b]Combat[/b]\\nThe real attraction is the combat. As I mentioned, it's very similar in feel to the Witcher 3. Now, if you've played the Witcher 3, you know that all runes except the protective one are basically useless compared to just hitting stuff with your sword.\\n\\nSo imagine the Witcher 3, but with awesome spells, and you have the combat in Hogwars Legacy. If you're good at cycling spell sets, you can do combos with an array of up to 16(!) different spells. The skill ceiling is insanely high on these, and it's a lot of fun to watch the fireworks so to speak, as you sling burning goblins into each other, back to you, set them on fire, and back again. It's A LOT of fun!\\n\\n[b]Environment[/b]\\nOh my goodnees, the environment! This is hands-down the most fun I've had exploring since... ever, probably. You get to bloody fly, and they barely restrict it! And it's awesome! There's so much to see, so much to collect. For completionists like me, it's both a dream and nightmare at the same time.\\n\\nMost places have little lore tid-bits for you to collect and read, and the environment is lovingly hand-crafted, with a real attention to detail. Especially Harry Potter fans will really appreciate it, but honesly I think it's impressive no matter who you are.\\n\\nThe only thing that really ruins it a bit, is the population of this world. Similar to early Cyberpunk, the sidewalk characters do.... literally nothing. They just walk around aimlessly, or stand idle in their set positions. Sometimes they say some neat things, but it's generally pretty disappointing when we're so used to better in games these days.\\n\\nBut otherwise, the environments of this game are beautiful. Graphically it's a bit last-gen, but the art direction is superb, and to top it off, it actually runs pretty well. At least, it does for me.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'First of all. \\nI really liked the game up until the end. Finished the Campaign and most other stuff ( 97% completion of my challenges ). \\nThe soundtrack and feeling you get is very nice, the artwork is amazing. \\n\\nI have stuttering issues but it was playable. (might be my pc tbh... i7-6700k isnt what it used to be :P ) \\n\\nThe thing that actually made me sad is the feeling that none of my decisions mattered.\\nWhatever I said, whenever I pushed for the \"Dark Side\".... In the end... I´m the hero. \\n\\nNeither the ending nor anything else apart from maybe learning the 3 unforgiveables feels like its up to your choice. \\n\\nBeeing rude to NPCs / extorting them / betraying quest givers. \\nNothing happens... apart from maybe a different voiceline, but then everything is back to normal. \\n\\nI literally chose to take the powers. \\nI used all unforgivable curses. \\nNobody cared. I was the hero... YAAAAAAY.... \\n\\nReplay value probably 0 unless you want to see a different common room / play in different house colours and maybe have 5 different side quests... \\n\\nApart from that. \\nCharacter feels overpowered very very easily if you put the talent points in the right talents combined with the right gear enchantments. \\nWhich is very hard to avoid considering how many points you get vs how many points are even possible to spend in total...',\n",

       "  'review': 'Hogwarts Legacy is an action adventure RPG set in the Harry Potter universe well before the history of the movies.\\nThe universe is very well retranscribed and very immersive, the number of references, small details or lore are huge and you will be directly immersed in it if you are a fan of the universe.\\n\\nThe story is very intriguing, you want to go on to know the continuation but also want to take your time and do the many other possible activities in the game. The exploration is excellent, there are a lot of collectibles scattered in the open world that will allow you to unlock in addition to the lore, various cosmetic elements. There are as in any open world, a good number of side quests, as well as a housing system very chill. If you like loot, you will enjoy it.\\n\\nI was afraid of the combat system but it is actually very satisfying, many combo are possible thanks to the different spells you will unlock during the adventure. There is also a possibility to play in infiltration even if it remains quite minimal. The \"dungeon\" system is really cool too, there are a lot of side areas where you can find more loot and there are also many interesting puzzles but often spoiled in my opinion by the clues given a little too quickly.\\n\\nDespite its optimization which could have been better, I recommend this excellent game (probably already GOTY) which if you are a fan of the universe but also if you are looking for an open world with a lot of content and a quite innovative universe will satisfy you.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2931209680',\n",

       "  'review': \"*spoiler free review*\\n\\nI wouldn't consider myself a huge Harry Potter fan, but I've watched all the movies and read the books too and I love the wizarding world and all the amazing things about it. \\nI love this game. It's very clear that the developers have paid attention to details and have really put in love and effort to make this game. \\nI should say though, after an explosive starting scene, it's a bit of a slow progression in the  beginning. You'll need to master some spells, meet around people, etc to really be prepared to start the actual journey. Even your brooms comes in at around 10 hours into the game. But it's definitely worth the wait. \\n\\nThe gameplay itself is pretty good. Using different spells for different enemies. They have a pretty good variety and I'm not disappointed. The map is good, there's fast travel options, talent points to unlock new abilities, etc. \\n\\nThe best thing about the game is the world itself and they've executed it perfectly. Even if I'm just walking around the castle, I find things which make me smile. Honestly, I feel like I'm s student of Hogwarts and I'm exploring this amazing place. The castle is the best place, but there are outside places too. Lots of sidequests, puzzles, dungeons, etc. Basically, it's everything you'd expect from the world of magic. \\n\\nBut ofcourse, it's not perfect. There are certainly some flaws. There are a few glitches which affected the gameplay. And was so huge and I can't progress a quest at all. The number of gear slots are way too less and I'm forced to sell most of my unused gears to make space for new ones. Some of the puzzles are just repetitive that I gave up on them being bored of it. \\n\\nBut those are just minor things. I'm sure they'll fix the glitches too. But seriously, I love this game and I definitely have my money's worth. I'm around 23 hours in and I know that there's lots more waiting for me in terms of story and I'm going to have a blast. \\n\\nSo final verdict, just get it. You won't regret it. \\n\\nPS: Just ignore all the hate for this game regarding the JK stuff. Just because one old woman if being inhuman, you're going to ignore the love and effort of hundreds of game creators? I mean, there are even lesbian couples and trans characters in the game (sure, it must be the marketing strategy, but it's still representation nonetheless). This game is not about the one person, it's about a group of developers who love this project. Just think about that too before you make a decision.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Hogwarts Legacy is a dream come true for any Potterhead! While the graphics may not be the most spellbinding, they are still decent and do a good job of bringing the world of Hogwarts to life. The gameplay, however, is as smooth as butterbeer, and the story is a delightful romp through the beloved world of Harry Potter. I was absolutely spellbound by the ability to create my own wizard and attend Hogwarts, experiencing all the magic and wonder I've only ever read about. From casting spells to flying broomsticks, this game has it all. I mean, who wouldn't want to live their own Hogwarts story? Oh and did I mention you can pet the cats?\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I strongly believe that this game would not be as popular if it wasn\\'t about the world of Harry Potter. There is an obvious love for visual details in the game, but there is not much substance behind it. \\nThe common rooms look beautiful, but there is absolutely nothing to do in them, you cannot talk to the npc\\'s there, you cannot sit in a chair or sleep in your bed...\\n\\n These are but  a few minor details, but indicative of a bigger problem with the game; there is no immersion, your character does not seem to be part of the world. You cannot interact with most NPCs. they do not react to your spells, the dialogue options mostly do not matter for the progression of the story, there is no real day/night cycle (There is day and night, but shops are also open in the night, vendors do not seem to sleep or go out of their shop).\\n\\nAfter a few hours the combat gets repetitive, there is not a lot of enemy variety, the number of brewable potions and of plants is low. There is no real excitement of which spells you will be able to learn because the UI shows you all the spells and their names from the beginning, they are simply not selectable. The \"unforgivable\" curses are totally forgivable, there is 0 consequences to using them, during missions you can use them right next to your professor and he won\\'t care in the slightest...\\n\\nMost hidden areas just contain a single chest with randomly generated loot. Your gear slots are very limited so you will have to fast travel a lot to vendors simply to get rid of the loot. Your gear is upgradeable, but I never bothered to upgrade it and under normal difficulty there really seems to be no reason to upgrade it.\\n\\nFinally there is a ton of collectibles (field pages, chests etc...) But these mostly to have been put in there to artificially add playing hours which provide little entertainement.\\n\\nI had a few hours of fun in the beginning, exploring the castle etc, but after that the veil fell and I noticed how basic the gameplay is and how unoriginal the main story line is. I would definitely wait for a price drop before buying it.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]I\\'ll keep this as spoiler-free as possible, and this review is entirely subjective to my own opinions[/h1]\\nWhat appeals to me most about Hogwarts Legacy isn\\'t its mastery over just one aspect of the game, but how it seems to achieve so much in a singular title. I have spent a considerable amount of time on several recent AAA titles but nothing comes close to complete at this.\\n\\nTo elaborate, Forspoken had amazing gameplay and parkour mechanics but the NPC interactions felt stiff and clearly weren\\'t very polished. Spider-Man similarly had great gameplay and cinematic story-telling, but it didn\\'t feel like a very personalized experience more so than a trip to the movies. Hogwarts Legacy was different. You don\\'t dive straight into any long intense combat sessions or get super flashy moves from the get-go, but instead emphasize gradual progression and an immersive experience.\\n\\n[h1]What\\'s so great about slow progression?[/h1]\\nFor starters, it\\'s much more rewarding, and it gives you time to absorb the rich history, lore, and present-day slice of life the developers have prepared for you. I\\'m about 10 hours into the game and every dialogue I\\'ve been in so far was fully voiced, even your own character. So many things are happening simultaneously in the school, random events will trigger as you walk around and it really goes to show just how much love the developers have placed into this game to curate such an immersive experience.\\n\\n[h1]What I think Hogwarts Legacy did right[/h1]\\nDefinitely World-building, 100%. Even though the whole \"theme\" of Hogwarts is a magic school, few places inside felt completely the same. I\\'m surprised at the variety of assets they created. I\\'ll see things I\\'ve never seen before, walk up, study them, and there are even field guides that tell you what they are. Every part of the school feels unique and the experience was in short, magical. From the different animal skeletons you find, the moving paintings, the ghosts loitering around, the moving (empty) knights in armor, to even the students walking to class and all the conversations I can eavesdrop on. There\\'s already so much to talk about and I haven\\'t even counted the open world.\\n\\nThe relationships you meet at school don\\'t feel at all superficial. They don\\'t always mention it directly, but just their expressions, choice of words, and tone of voice are enough for you to draw your own conclusions about what has happened behind the scenes, making the game feel more expansive than it already is. I\\'m really enjoying talking to people and despite having the option to skip text as you read, I have yet to skip a single dialogue, all so I can hear the voice acting in full.\\n\\nAttending classes, meeting new professors, and exploring Hogwarts Castle didn\\'t feel as restrictive as I would have thought. On the contrary, I had so much freedom to do whatever I wanted, even explore the open world that I\\'ve never grown weary at the thought of being forced to go to class or feel trapped in a linear gameplay loop.\\n\\nI usually have pretty high expectations for real-time combat systems, but Hogwarts Legacy genuinely did it justice. It was surprisingly fun, and I find myself craving to meet new foes and fight as soon as possible. It\\'s not as hard as dark souls, but I\\'m certainly seeing some semblance of one. You can cast offensive magic spells but starting out you won\\'t be reliant on them to decimate your foes. Instead, you\\'ll be using the most fundamental basic attacks, defending, countering, and dodging the majority of the time. It takes some time to master but it feels a lot more rewarding than being a walking auto-killing machine.\\n\\nNext would be Flying. They did it right by not forcing it into a priority mode of transport like most games. It makes traveling the open world more enjoyable, there\\'s a Stamina System (for boosting) that keeps the player\\'s attention and the no-flying zones help limit the player\\'s reliability on them. I find that the moment we get some sort of mount or fast-moving mode of transport, players will be using that ALL the time and they start missing out on all the wonderful details in the world, the voices that play in the background. Flying only plays a small part of this, but I\\'ve seen many games where world-building\\xa0has become less important than getting to the destination quicker in an effort to min-max time and resources.\\n\\nThere\\'s the beasts and plants mechanic, talents, customization features, dialogue choices, and lots of things that make the world richer and more personalized. I\\'ll cut it short here since I think this section is already pretty long. All in all, games should be an enjoyable experience, and I think Hogwarts did a great job of focusing on the healthier aspects of a game for the players.\\n\\n[h1]What I think Hogwarts Legacy didn\\'t do right[/h1]\\nAlthough they did a lot of optimizations to keep the experience seamless, the experience can sometimes be jarring and offputting. There weren\\'t any loading screens whenever you move between areas, but you\\'ll find your game lagging very frequently as a result for short bursts of time before it becomes smooth again.\\n\\nIt\\'s caused me a lot of headaches to be honest. I\\'m looking at a pretty big screen, and the lag spikes paired with the intense motion blur cause me bouts of motion sickness. If you\\'re reading this and you have the same issue, I highly recommend you turn off motion blur, and also increase the field of view to +20 in the display options.\\n\\nI\\'m not familiar with the minimum graphics requirement, but I\\'m running a Ryzen 5950x, RTX 3060Ti with 64GB RAM, and the benchmark recommended settings are set to Medium. Even with Nvidia DLSS, going any higher will result in a significant hit in performance, especially when entering any cutscenes. On the Steam Deck, it runs pretty smooth on the Low Graphics Settings, but the experience was pretty much incomparable. In the case of Spider-Man for example, the experience on PC and Steam Deck felt almost identical and the graphics were still crisp and smooth, but it wasn\\'t the case on the Steam Deck.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nThis turned out to be fairly long. Woah. In any case, everything above is completely based on my own opinions having played the game during the Early Launch Period. There may be patches and updates in the future that addresses the concerns I have above. Despite its flaws, Hogwarts Legacy is still an amazing game, and compared to any other full-priced AAA title on the market, as long as you have a love for fantasy, magic, and RPGs, you\\'ll definitely get your money\\'s worth. That would be all.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Hogwarts Legacy'i HP ile olan ilişkimizden kopuk bir şekilde ele alamayız herhalde. Malum ''fanlar bunu yıllardır bekliyor''. Ben yıllardır beklemiyorum çünkü fanı değilim. HPyi sevsem de, bende özel bir yeri yoktur. Yalnızca çocuksu güzelliği, artık bu ne demekse, ve çocuksu güzelliğine karşın karanlık bir tarafının da olması ile hoşuma giden bir evrendir kendisi. Estetik zevklerime hitap eder. Çokça konsept ve fikir barındıran, geniş ama derin olmayan eğlenceli bir evrendir. Bu oyunun da benim için ekstra bir değeri yoktu yani. Ama evreninde gezmek için gayet de heyecanlanmıştım. \\n\\nFakat zaman geçtikçe, oyunun videoları düşmeye başladıkça beklentim git gide düştü. Dünyası yine heyecan verici gözüküyordu fakat hem oynanışa dair bir şeyler göstermek yerine, ''bakın odanızı yapabiliyorsunuz'' tarzı ev kurmacalara ağırlık verilmesi, hem de gösterilen oynanışın da pek iç açıcı durmayışı da bu negatifliğimi arttırdı. \\n\\nHele son zamanlarda düşen combat videoları çok kötüydü. Kafayı kullandıracak bir oynanıştan çok, hacknslash vari, düşmanları havaya kaldırıp sektirmekten ibaret gibiydi. Düşmanlar da pek zeki gözükmüyor, doğru dürüst saldırmıyorlardı falan. Son zamanlarda çıkmış ''ışık atmalı'' çoğu oyunun başarısız olması, Forspoken ve Ghostwire güzel örnekler değildi. Bu da öyle olacak gibi gözüküyordu.\\n\\nNeyse, işte böyle facia düşüncelerin ortasına iniş yaptı Hogwarts. Ben de incelemeleri düşmeden almayı düşünmüyordum. [i]Sağ olsunlar, çok nazik ve cömert olan bazı arkadaşlarım sayesinde :), hediye geldi ve girdim oyuna.[/i] Peki nasıl olmuş?! Yani... Oynadığım kadarıyla çok güzel!? \\n\\n[h1]Başarılı İllüzyon[/h1]\\nHogwarts Legacy, oynadığımız bütün bu video oyunlarının, aslında birer illüzyondan ibaret olduklarını ve yalnızca kişi üstünde çalışırsa oyuncuyu içinde, sorgulatmadan tutabildiğinin önemli bir kanıtı olabilir. Şöyle ki, normalde diğer pek çok oyunda olsa, şikayet edeceğim ve çabucak sıkılacağım şeyler bunda var. Mesela, sürüyle toplanabilir kağıt, basit mi basit ''eşyam kayıp onu bul'' tarzı yan görevler. Fakat Hogwarts'ın illüzyonu üzerimde çalıştı ve tüm bunların peşinden 30 saattir sıkılmadan koşturuyorum. Bu konuda, illüzyon katmanı dışında ortaya koydukları tek olay, tüm bu toplanabilirlerin basit ya da küçük de olsa bulmacalarla ulaşılabilir olması. \\n\\nOyunun dünyası da göz alıcı, merak uyandırıcı ve sürükleyici bir dünya. Hogwarts'ın içi özellikle, çok çok güzel tasarlanmış. Ve neredeyse hiçbir yer de ''senaryoda yeterince ilerlemedin o yüzden burası sana kapalı şu an'' engeli barındırmıyor, her yere daha en baştan gidebiliyorsunuz. Sınıfları görevlerle değil de, kendi başıma gezerken keşfetmek çok hoşuma gitti mesela oyunun başında. Bu ortamlar sayesinde üstteki basit şeyler sizi rahatlıkla meşgul edebiliyor, eğlendiriyor. \\n\\nCombat tarafından umudumun olmaması bir tarafa; oyunda, büyüler sayesinde hoş yan aktiviteler ile uğraşabileceğimizi umut ediyordum. Genel olarak öyle de oldu. Yine de, belki mini oyun tarafına biraz daha önem verilebilirmiş. Daha güzel işler çıkartılabilirmiş. Küçük puzzlelar dışında, çok çok az mini oyun var. Quidditch'in olmaması epey üzdü o ayrı ama, en azından güzel bir tekrar oynanabilir süpürge yarışları olabilirmiş. Ya da Accio ile oynadığımız top oyunu daha da geliştirebilir veya onun yanına tekrar tekrar oynanabilir yeni şeyler eklenebilirmiş. Henüz oyunda her şeyi tamamen görmedim. Umarım vardır böyle şeylerden daha çok. \\n\\nAyrıca hikayenin de tamamen yeni karakterler çevresinde, kendi karakterimizi oluşturmamız üzerine bizim çevremizde dönmesi de hoşuma gitti. Bir HP hikayesi takip etmektense, kendi hikayemi yaşıyorum düşüncesi daha benlik oldu. \\n\\n[h1]Ders Ödevleri[/h1]\\nGörünenin aksine combat da gayet eğlenceli olmuş. Oyunu zorda oynuyorum, videolardaki gibi değil hiçbir düşman. Gerçekten aman vermiyorlar ve rahatlıkla ölebiliyorum 3-4 hatada. Ama işin güzel yanı, düşmanlar da, eğer bir de doğru komboları yaparsanız, kolay ölüyorlar. Sünger gibi değiller. \\n\\nOyun çıkmadan önce çok konuşulan, ''sadece 26 büyü mü?'' eleştirisine katılmıyordum. Beni endişelendiren sayıdan çok, olan şeylerin oyuna nasıl yedirildiği idi. Bu konuda bence daha iyi olabilirmiş. Ana hikayeyi ilerletmekte hiç acele etmediğim halde, her şeyin elime bir anda verildiğini hissetmedim değil. Bunun sebebi de sanırım, büyüleri oyun size kendi eli ile kullandırtmıyor. Yani ihtiyacınız olmuyor. Çevredeki bulmacalarda gerekiyor bu büyüler ama henüz ana görevlerde, bana verdiği o spesifik büyüyü kullanmamı sağlayacak veya gerektirecek bir mekanik tanıtmadı bana oyun. Sadece bazı düşmanlar kendilerine 4 büyü türünden birisinde kalkan açıyor, o kalkan da yalnızca açılan türdeki bir büyü ile saldırı yaptığımızda kırılıyor. Bunun dışında bana oyun kendi çizgisi içinde ''şu büyüyü kullanman lazım'' demedi.\\n\\nÖte yandan, oyun size onları kullanmanız için ödevler veriyor. Büyüleri öğrenmek için, öncesinde hocaların size verdiği ödevleri tamamlamanız gerekiyor. Çoğunlukla combata girmeyi ve o sırada belli bir hareketi yapmanızı gerektiren ödevler bunlar. Bana bu ilginç geldi ve hoşuma gitti. \\n\\nÇeşitli düşmanların çeşitli büyülere zayıflıkları oluyor. Fakat onları çözmek size bırakılmış. Oyun ''kurtların şunlara zayıflığı var'' şeklinde ağzıyla söylemiyor size. Düşmanları kırmak için zayıflığının olduğu büyüyü bulmanız gerekiyor. Üstüne, bir de hepsini daha rahat alt etmek için, kombolarda ustalaşmanız gerekiyor. Çok derin olan şeyler değil bunların hiçbirisi, ama oyunu gayet keyifli yapmaya yetmiş hepsi. Büyülerin yanı sıra, bitkileri falan kullanmak da çok eğlenceli. \\n\\nBir de düello challengeları var. Belki de en hoşuma giden içeriklerden birisi. Neredeyse her dövüş sırasında size ekstra hedefler veren ödevler çıkıyor. Bunları yaparak hem bir koleksiyonu tamamlıyorsunuz, hem de oynarken size düşünecek bir şey daha vermesi daha keyifli kılmış dövüşleri de. \\n\\n[h1]Geniş Ama Derin Değil[/h1]\\nDünyadaki karakterlerin tek amacı size bir konsepti tanıtmak. ''Konsept''en kastım da, yeni bir toplanabilir kategorisi. Onun dışında ilişki kurduğumuz, hikayesine tanık olduğumuz yan görev serisi, oynadığım kadarıyla hiç yok. Pek çok şey tanıtılıp size bırakılıyor. Ve o şeylerden de haritada şımarık sayıda var. Mesela ben hafiften Merlin bulmacaları peşinde koşmaktan yorulmaya başladım. 30a yakın yapmışımdır, ama hala harita onlarla dolu. Sayıların fazlalığını, bunları sadece toplanabilir iş olarak değil de, güzel bir yan görev serisine bağlı, sonucunda ödülü hoş olan bir sistemle perdelenebilirdi. Ama o da yok henüz oynadığım kadarıyla. Sanırım hepsini yaparsam güzel bir skin falan alacağım. Bir de oyun bana ''aferim'' diyecek.\\n\\nBir de son olarak, keşke looter shooter kafasında yapmasalarmış ekipman işini. Bir de üstüne şaka geçer gibi, envanter sınırı koymasalarmış. Bunlar yerine, hali hazırda evrende var olan, şöyle ''efsanevi'' karakterlerin efsanevi ekipmanları peşinden koştuğumuz güzel bir yan görev sistemi falan olsaymış. Skin şeklinde kullanabildiklerimizden bahsetmiyorum, kendine münhasır özellikleri olan ekipmanlardan bahsediyorum.\\n\\n[b]Totalde Hogwarts Legacy bence gerçekten yenilir, yutulur ve doyulur bir oyun olmuş. O illüzyonu kaldırdığınızda, aşağıda dönen mekanikler de yeterli denilebilecek seviyede çarklar ile dolu. Ama daha derin de olabilirmiş çoğu. Tıpkı edebiyatı gibi, oyunu da, bir sürü güzel ama küçük fikirlerle dolu. Oyunu kurtarmaya yetiyor mu yetiyor, daha iyi olabilir miymiş, kesinlikle.[/b]\\n\\nOyunu bitirince yazıya ekleme yapacağım.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Words can\\'t describe how disappointed I am in this game. This was advertised as \"make your own path\" kind of game, yet it can\\'t be further away from the truth. There is one path, and it\\'s the one the game gives you. There is no becoming a dark wizard, or a good one... you\\'re just the character the game tells you to be.\\n\\nThe whole game is lifeless, NPCs don\\'t react to anything you do, you can talk to some of them but that\\'s it. You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people\\'s house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won\\'t say or do a thing, they just act like you\\'re not even there. \\n\\nMost of the time you can\\'t jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I\\'m still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can\\'t attack centors, because yeah... you\\'re not a bad person, so the game won\\'t let you do bad things. \\n\\nYou can fly on a broom, and again, it\\'s slow, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it\\'s okay to ram into a wall. \\n\\nThe only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It\\'s well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don\\'t change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game\\'s lead. It\\'s basically a playable cinematic.\\n\\nSo to sum it up, it is yet again a very expensive game that brings nothing new to the table, with empty promises and seemingly half finished features. Was expecting this to be a Skyrim with HP world, turned out to be a plain adventure game you can\\'t even play with your friends.\\n\\n4/10',\n",

I have not been rushing but going through the quests fast and i am only at 41% completion of the quests and 6% exploration , 55% field guides and 23% combat and cant remember the other , but this game has hours of play time and this is just through the one house , you can do it 4 times !!!! Jesus what a single player.  The graphics are outstanding on high. now im running a I9 , 128gb of corsair vengence pro and a old school gtx 1080ti palit and the recommended from the in game bench mark was high , which is driven by my old graphics card.  I have the odd stutter here and there , but hey !!!  they aint no pvp'er gonna get you chill wait for it to dissapear in about 3 seconds and love it again !    i have had one crash since 7th of Feb and this was self inflicted with games being to download in the background etc..... but to cut a long story short BUY IT\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Meh. Stylistically the game is great. The castle feels pretty alive and and it has many of the environmental elements I would expect from Hogwarts. The environments/areas outside the castle are similarly polished.\\n\\nUnfortunately, such appearances only go skin deep. There is very limited interactivity with your environment outside of the scripted quests or the various treasure hunt type items. You can\\'t interact with any of the people that aren\\'t vendors or active in a given quest, can\\'t sit down in a chair or on a bench, no real commentary on player actions whatsoever. I have yet to feel drawn into the world as none of the characters are ever really present to engage with. I have no companions unless they are needed for a quest, there are no rivalries to be had (which is rather more noticeable as I went Slytherin) and that\\'s well before any of the immersion breaking progressive nonsense is added in. Short of it is, I don\\'t ever feel like a student at Hogwarts, I feel like a \"Mary Sue\\'d\" outsider partaking in a magical murder mystery theater.\\n\\nSpeaking of quests, they are also \"meh\" for the most part. The main quest line is rather engaging and keeps you moving forward to find out what happens next, but the side quests are quite boring and often just boil down to your standard \"go fetch\" type quests. I have not found any side quest of substance as of yet.\\n\\nCombat is one of the saving graces so far. Generally quite intuitive and enjoyable. Presents a decent challenge while also making you feel like a spell slinging bad-ass on occasion.\\n\\nOh, and the loot.  Seriously the loot system and types of loot is ridiculous.  The mechanics aren\\'t horrible, but the immersion break is.  My eyes ache from the rolling whenever, after traversing an \"ancient\" dungeon/crypt/cave, bypassing puzzles, slaying enemies, etc. I then spy an impressive looking chest, only to open said chest and be awarded with... a new scarf/house robe/glasses. -.-  \\n\\nStill have a ways to go in the game, so I\\'m gonna keep an open mind till I complete the game, but so far... Meh.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Double, double, toil and trouble\\nFire burn and cauldron bubble\\nSomething wicked this way comes! [/h1]\\n\\nIt has come, after so many years and controversies the Avalanche studio finally released the one of the most anticipated games, the Hogwarts Legacy. As a youngster who grew up with Harry Potter books, I finally had the opportunity to visit the famous school of witchcraft and magic, and I am generally pleased. Almost every corner of the castle is actually full with nostalgia and magical charm that all truth fans might desire. The world is filled with details and exploring them is a lot of pleasure.\\n\\nBut you can not get around and fly in the ointment: The Deluxe version was a horrible idea since allowing people to play the raw game for extra money is strange, especially because the game will recieve a first-day patch that will fix the difficulties the game had during first 72 hours, such as loading times and kind of bad-ish optimistation/performance even with 30 rtx series.\\n\\nIt is truly wonderful to see such work being done by a company that previously only had expertise with Disney Infinity as a title of this size. I personally wish Avalnche the best of luck and hope to see more intriguing ventures in the future!\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'EDIT: All of this still applies after Day 1 patch/DLC. It has done absolutely nothing in the performance department\\n\\nLet me start by saying that when this game works it is fantastic and there are tons of people the game runs well for that are around my specs or even lower with 10-series GPUs. I am not trying to ruin that for anyone and I entirely understand why people love this game and are going to upvote in reviews or even get mad down in the replies. \\n\\nHowever this is not the case for everyone and plenty of others with high end systems are having problems and the game is truly impossible to experience with such horrendous stability issues. Performance problems are being spammed on their official bug tracker website, under their most popular replies on all recent twitter posts, and discussions from the community on Steam/Reddit. So downplaying it cus you want a hive-mind to circlejerk your favorite game is foolish. Ignorant comments from actual robots such as \"mUH gAmeE wORk sO uR cOmPUteR bAD\" are everywhere and completely useless to the discussion or finding out the issue/fix, these comments will be ignored and probably deleted.\\n\\nIt is absolutely unacceptable to sell an early launch of a game as a product, make people pay more than base price, then have a large chunk of players with a massive range of specs and settings realize after the 1-2 hour tutorial when you finally get to roam around that the game is absolutely broken, unplayable, and unoptimized. If you have to wait for a patch or game ready driver then why even sell the early release of the game at all?\\n\\nMy specs more than clear any requirement for this game as well as any others on the market, yet during cut scenes and exploring the school it is absolutely unplayable, locking my fps to 10-15 as well as slowing down my entire PC including wallpapers on my second monitor until I close the game out entirely.\\n\\nFULL SPECS:\\n3080ti\\nRyzen 9 5900x\\n32GB of DDR4-3200 Ram\\nSSD (I have even moved the game to another SSD and I still get poor results)\\n3440x1440 (Have tried lowering resolution as well)\\n\\nNo, turning settings down does nothing before you comment. Turning off RT seemed to give me some extra performance temporarily however I still hit the wall of 10-15 FPS every playsession.\\n\\nI have also tried:\\nDisable SMT\\nEnable Control Flow Guard\\nUpdating/rolling back drivers(Got the newest one from 2/8 as well)\\nChanging to a new SSD\\nDisabling second monitor\\nUpdating DLSS manually\\n\\nMy review is going up negative and will stay that way until the end of time regardless of patches. It is horrible business practice to sell people a product that does not function for a large percentage of the user base. They even went the extra mile to charge people more for an early release, when the product you purchased refuses to work. You shouldnt have to buy something then do two dozen work-arounds that never even do anything as you try to do the devs job for them.\\n\\nRant over.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] Generic Open World Game With a Wizard Theme [/h1]\\n\\n[i] This review is spoiler free, and I have finished the game in offline mode so my hours are off. [/i]\\n\\nAfter having finished the game this morning, Hogwarts Legacy is no different from any Ubisoft game you have played in the last 15 years. The game is boggled with meaningless side quests, and the story is lackluster. With the Harry Potter IP, so much more could have been done. I am just disappointed.\\n\\n[h1] Character Creation [/h1]\\n\\nI do not understand who made the choice to remove any actual sort of customization to a game like this. You select character preset, and change their hair, eye color, etc. That's it. No ear shape, nose shape, jaw, nothing. Seeing as most other games offer that at the bare minimum, it's hard to see why they removed it. They lock it into a sense of realism, which is weird for a fantasy game. If I want green skin, I should be able to have green skin. \\n\\n[h1] Atmosphere [/h1]\\n\\nThe main draw of the game, Hogwarts, is both a blessing and a curse. The animations of the stairs building, ghosts popping in and out, and the joyful music playing are probably the best parts of the game. That's all there is to it however, It just looks good. You cannot interact with any of the students. It's like an amusement park attraction. The only option is to walk around, observe, and eat an apple. \\n\\nThe only other game I played set in an environment like this was Bully, and that game offered way more freedom than the developers here have allowed. It's hard to immerse yourself when you're pretty much watching a movie about your character, rather than actually playing as them.\\n\\n[h1] Main Story [/h1]\\n\\nThe story is nothing special. It's not bad, but I was not excited to keep playing it. Can't say much else without spoiling.\\n\\n[h1] Side Content [/h1]\\n\\nI know I should not say the Witcher 3 side quests are the cream of the crop, as that is just overstated at this point, but it is what it is. I can't help to compare them to the cookie cutter ones we got here. Go collect 6 gobstoppers for this kid. Go find this obscure cliff from the mirror to find a chest with ugly glasses in it. Ubisoft-type missions and heavily prevalent. Side missions have no multiple endings, and they always end up predictable.\\n\\n[h1] Combat [/h1]\\n\\nIn Hogwarts, you will get into plenty of scraps. a good ol' bout with some real scum. You will have to use your spells to blast your foes, so hopefully there's lots of them, right? Well, there's only [b] 26 [/b] spells. Yes, you hears that right, only [b] 26 [/b]. That's without even mentioning that you can only equip 4 spells at a time. They took the Mass Effect Andromeda route of limiting your combat for the sake of, i don't even know. With only 4 at a time, I felt extremely limited in what I could do.\\n\\n The animations themselves are great, but when looking at a game like Elden Ring, who has [b] 150 [/b] spells, and the game isn't only a wizard game, you realize that much more could have been done. Skyrim even has [b] 171 [/b] spells. And just like Elden Ring, that game has much more than just magic. \\n\\nAlso, after comparing the difficulties between hard and normal, it is only a health bar difference. Enemies will damage you more, and you do less damage. Underwhelming if you ask me, when you could have had them use more strategy in taking you down.\\n\\nI know people won't like this, but Forspoken magic looks a lot better than this game. No one has actually played it, so no one has actually seen how good it looks.\\n\\n[h1] Exploration [/h1]\\n\\nThis is by far the worst part of this game. Everything is locked behind a level based lock. most of Hogwarts Legacy is hidden behind locks that you must progress the story to unlock. You cannot explore at your own pace. I say it again, the developers choose when you get to have fun. It is a shame, as the world is beautiful. \\n\\nRiding the broomstick is amazing, I spent a lot of time just riding around. Mounts are great as well, love the threstral mount that I got from the deluxe edition.\\n\\nThis one is a little nitpicky, but the doors feel weightless. Your character just pushes them open extremely fast, its honestly very jarring. The huge doors in the fountain area open effortlessly, which is extremely weird to me.\\n\\n[h1] XP Collection [/h1]\\n\\nThis is the one thing that has left me completely confused. You only get XP by collecting lore scrolls around the map. WHY? No XP from defeating monsters, no growing stronger from your battles, you have to click left on the D-Pad, listen for a bell noise, and find a scroll to level up. I hate it. Don't forget the flying scrolls that you just grab out the air effortlessly.\\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1] \\n\\nHogwarts Legacy brings nothing new to the table. The graphics are the best part of the game, everything else is a either a weird gameplay decision, or a mechanic jacked from another game, yet done far worse. I would say this game is good of you love Harry Potter, and do not really play video games. Otherwise, this game is way overpriced for what it offers, and you may get bored easily once the initial honeymoon phase wears off around a few hours.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'No wonder CS is 20+ years old. This game is so addictive. I was never really into gaming but this game changed my opinion. This is one of the most accurate FPS games ever made with 128 tick servers. This game requires passion, dedication, hardwork, skill & a lot of practice because every pixel counts when you trigger you gun. Rumours say CS:GO is going to shift on Source 2 Engine within 2 weeks, really excited for it. \\n\\nWhen you will play on low tier like Silver & Gold Nova you may lose many games because of your teammates. They may do basic mistakes like Run & Gun, Team Flash etc. But never rage on them. Always remember we used to do the same basic mistakes when we were beginners. I know this game involves lot of emotion but keep your calm & make sure to teach the beginners. Our community is already toxic, lets not make it more.\\n\\nYou win or you learn, you never lose.\\n\\n[b] CS will never die. [/b]\\n\\nEdit: Source 2 is still not out. You can play on 128 tick rate servers on third party clients like FaceIt, ESEA, 5E Play etc.',\n",

That IS if you practice and learn the way the game is supposed to be played.\\n\\nActually requires a lot of patience, aim control, learning of map locations, etc.\\n\\nEdit Dec 7, 2018: Stupid crazy full with hackers, now that it\\'s F2P i feel like it\\'s gonna get taken over by even more hackers... RIP 2012 CSGO.\\n\\nEDIT 2021/09/03: Some of you are morons here... Clearly a huge \"fan\" base of CSGO. I\\'ve gathered around 9,000+ hours in total (in my other account as well) No. I wasn\\'t a \"Noob\" or had no skill. I was GE for a very long time.\\n\\nThis review is from 2018. After all the new updates came into place. I LOVED the game, It was my addiction. After those updates, everything went down hill. MORE toxicity, MORE blatant hackers, and I for one wasn\\'t a big fan of the newest updates. So I decided to leave, updated this review with my most recent experience.\\nReviews are meant to talk about your experience, Not to kiss ass and make things look good when they aren\\'t.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I was very young when I first got to know Counter-Strike back in  the early days of Counter-Strike 1.5.\\nIt was in an Internet-Café during Holidays where I even got to play the game for the first time. \\n\\nSome years later some friends from the area were playing CS 1.6 and thats where I joined the Steam and Counterstrike-Community on January 8th, 2006. \\n\\nWe formed a team, trained about two years and climbed up the ladder of our local CS-League here in Switzerland.\\nHowever, due to insufficient capacity (private life)  of some members and a lack of Morale we split up.\\n\\nI\\'ve seen Counter-Strike in all of its states from 1.5 on, 1.6, Condition Zero, Source, I even had my hands on the old mod called \"CS Promod\" where people tried to get the gameplay from 1.6 with the graphics of Source. Which was something I really liked.\\n\\nAfter a long break I decided to reroll in CS:GO and check out how the game had evolved. It took a while but the more I played and did matchmakings (good mm\\'s ^^) the more I wanted to set foot in E-Sports again. \\n\\nCS:GO is the perfect balance between the gameplay of 1.6 and the graphics of source (while its not source, definitely and luckily not.), to most efficient CS players ive talked to graphics dont matter and it explains why many Pro\\'s do play with low resolutions and stuff like that because it reminds them of the good ol\\' days (from what i\\'ve read).\\n\\nThough it still has its harsh and sometimes frustrating learning-curve, it is worth the effort because if you truly stick to it and learn about it each time you play and try to learn from your mistakes the better you get. \\n\\nSince all those years i\\'ve tried out almost all other game titles in the FPS genre, nothing could ever stand up against the simplicity and competitiveness of Counter-Strike for me. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a great team-experience (which you first need to create or join) in where every man counts, every round counts and has a big community involved with tournaments and stuff, this game is for you.\\n\\nHowever if you\\'re looking for a realistic shooter that compares guns 1:1 like in real life, with bulletdrop and things like that, this game is definitely not for you.\\n\\nI hope my shared thoughts on the game where helpful and gave you a bit of insight whether you want to join our community. \\n\\nBest Regards\\nKnight',\n",

There’s more talent than ever in pro CS, which means that in order to pick the best players in the world you need clear, specific criteria. To make this ranking, a player must have competed in a number of top tier events—no player can be awarded top ten status for simply being incredible online. Almost by default, that means the player will be on a top team as well, which is the case for everyone on this list. I also decided to use roughly the past six months’ results for statistical comparison, with obviously more emphasis on recent performances, as they are most likely more indicative of these players’ current form.',\n",

You can play it like a no-life gremlin, but you can also boot it up and just frick around with the lads and dads without worrying too much about strategic play. It's also a very fun eSport to watch if you're into that sort of thing. My CS:GO phase is done but I will always have fond memories of rushing B sneeki beeki like. EZPZ lemon squeezy\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I probably won't have a popular opinion here but it is how I feel none the less.\\n\\nI played CS a lot when it was first released as a mod for Half-life. I put hundreds of hours into both pub matches and matches with my friends in private servers. I stopped playing it at about the time that it was about to make the move to a retail product \\n\\nCounter-strike as a franchise is something of a time capsule. It is a example of a late 90's shooter frozen in time that never really changes and that is probably what makes it both novel for the average gamer and important for the competitive scene that has formed around it (and taken control of it in a lot of ways).\\n\\nBecause a e-sports style competitive scene has formed around Counter-strike, it puts Valve in a difficult position because they can't really change anything without facing harsh resistance from the veteran players. Even minor visual changes are met with extreme criticism because they may upset the carefully cultivated meta.\\n\\nIt was not always like this. When I was playing, the idea of e-sports level competitive play was only just starting to manifest and thus it was more rare to find the ultra-competitive players who get wrapped up in memorizing spread patterns, researching dominant strategies and reading up on the established meta. A lot of players back then were just there because it was fun to play and had a huge playerbase (thus meaning that servers were always reasonably available).\\n\\nPlaying Counter-strike back then was not the commitment that it can be now. The overall behavior of the playerbase was different. You may have gotten the usual smack talk during a match but you did not have people telling you to do things exactly this certain way in order for the whole thing to play out like a E-sports match either (at least not in any great number).\\n\\nPlaying Counter-strike now is essentially a test to see how much you like getting pub-stomped by uber-experienced and ultra-competitive players. It is not a overly welcoming place for new players (though not everyone is negative to new players and some will help you out) and has a culture all of it's own. This culture will either be really cool to you or annoying as hell, there is not much room for anything in between.\\n\\nIf you want a competitive gaming experience that is largely shaped by the most competitive (and vocal) players. Counter-strike is for you. If you want something more like a typical modern shooter or something that is more casual, It's not the best place to start.\\n\\nIn the end, this is just a opinion, I understand that Counter-strike is going to be a different experience for different people. I know that I am probably a bit old and thus missed the competitive level gaming boat by a few years but that does not change the fact that I have played (and own) Counter-strike: Global offensive and the culture that has formed around that game is not something I can really get into. Your mileage (of course) may very.\",\n",

Personally started playing in 2014 and regularly playing since has decent graphics for an FPS shooting game and can be played on low-end pcs as well. This is one of the games first games that got me into gaming and I wanna say it gave me a lot of experience.

However, if you have any plans whatesover on playing more of the game, you will have to pay probably 80$+. Is the dlcs worth buying? I would say it depends on the person. For a casual I would say its better to just find a new game, for those who really like destiny, its not a problem to spend a little extra on additional content.[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n    [tr]\\n        [th]Content & Replay Value:[/th]\\n        [td]Replay value when it comes to story I would say is close to 0, but the replay value of the pvp and raids are very good. There are at least 100+ hours of quality content here, and much more if you really enjoy the game.[/td]\\n    [/tr]\\n[/table]\\n\\n[h2]Pros[/h2]\\n[b]1.[/b]\\nThe gunplay is fantastic. Guns pack a proper punch. The handling feels solid, and there is nothing better than sniping another guardian in the head. The movement slightly differs from class to class but the mix of dodges and jumps provides more flexibility and a greater skill gap. There are certainly some balancing needed, however all in all I would say the gunplay is great.\\n\\n[b]2.[/b]\\nThe dungeons and raids are a great combination of puzzles, combat, parkour and boss fights. To finish a raid you pretty much have to have a mic and communicate with your team, but as long as your team consists of your friends its gonna be a great time. However, if your team is filled with randoms, prepare for a horrible time.\\n\\n[b]3.[/b]\\nThe uniqueness of exotic perks are truly where destiny shines. It can range from \"Melee kills restore health for a short duration.\" to \"Sliding reflects projectiles\". These exotics can drastically change your playstyle and makes the replay value a whole lot better.\\n\\n[h2]Cons[/h2]\\n[b]1.[/b]\\nYes this game is free. However, if you plan on playing any of the end game, or have any cool or unique armor or guns, you will have to spend money on DLCs. Playing this game without any DLCs is like eating french fries without salt, its possible... but are you okay?\\n\\n[b]2.[/b]\\nIf none of your friends play destiny 2, good luck with the end game content. You will be constantly reminded of how brain dead randoms can be. Also, playing destiny alone can be extremely boring. I personally NEVER boot the game if none of my friends are down to join. This may be very subjective but I can not play this game alone and not go insane.\\n\\n[b]3.[/b]\\nThe general destiny community is pretty decent. Don\\'t get me wrong, I have made some great friends through raids and dungeons, however the illusion of a friendly non-toxic community dissolves once you enter ranked PvP in any form. It is insane how many entitled bottom fraggers I have met. So many people join, don\\'t say a word the whole game, gets 27 damage, and rages once you lose. PvP can be great fun, just highly unlikely to achieve with randoms. Now there are exceptions to this as well, just extremely rare.\\n\\n[b]4.[/b]\\nDestiny does this fun little thing called \"Vaulting content\" which in long terms means removing content youve paid for. This is extremely infuriating. Removing the less actively played content players paid for, vaulting them, and \"maybe re-using them\" is not an acceptable excuse and a certain way to lose players. Entire planets disappearing, huge storylines gone, several guns and armor pieces no longer able to acquire. This is very unfortunate for new players as they will most likely never experience those missions and never get their hands on the items.\\n\\n[b]5.[/b]\\nThe matchmaking in this game is crazy. I can not tell you the amount of times me and my friend has queued for a match, and our teammate gets 0-25 damage per round, while every enemy has at least 3k hours in game and hits you the split second you peek. The matchmaking is truly a joke. You can not play this game seriously without having teammates before you queue.\\n\\n[h2] Bugs & issues[/h2]\\nAs for ghost melee and the revive feature not working sometimes, its rather self explanatory. Sometimes when you hit a melee, it doesn\\'t deal any damage and sometimes when you revive someone, they doesn\\'t actually get revived. This can lead to you loosing a very intense fight due to something that shouldn\\'t have happened, causing frustration, anger and maybe even sadness. \\n\\n[h2] Technical[/h2]\\nI use an i5 10400f with a 2070 super 8gb Vram and 32gb ram with a 280hz 1080p monitor, using a combination of mid to max settings and im sitting at around 180fps in pvp on average. It may drop down to around 140, but its never unstable or causes drastic fps drops. You will most likely not have any trouble with fps or performance if you have a decent PC.\\n\\n[h2]Verdict: Good, but not great[/h2]\\nAll in all, Destiny 2 offers fun and satisfying PvP, unique armor and guns as well as fantastic raids and dungeons. Destiny 2 can be very enjoyable, but the negatives are too big to ignore. I give this game a 7/10.\\n\\n[table]    [tr] [td] [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/42637369/] Follow my Curator Page if you want to see more of my reviews!

       "  'review': 'With almost 300 hours of Destiny 2 (D2) back on Battle.net (the Blizzard launcher), let me give this perspective/advice for new players, specifically with regards for the F2P offering that is Destiny 2: New Light, with a few more holistic thoughts sprinkled throughout:\\n\\nThis overall game is very good. It doesn\\'t always live up to its promise (the first mission of every campaign is always the most polished thing aside from the raids/dungeons), but when it does, it [b]really[/b] shines.\\n\\nThe gunplay is unrivaled. The visual/audio feedback is great, the handling feels really good, and enemies really pop when you take them out. Expect nothing less from the studio that brought us grunt birthday parties.\\n\\nThe game is better in a fireteam. Now that the base game is F2P [though with considerably less content than it used to be/I would like], this should be easier than ever for most activities. That said, a huge majority of my playtime was done solo. It can get tricky at times (\"Darkness Zones\" in certain missions prevent respawning but allow for revives, so solo players have a distinct disadvantage there). \\n\\nWith that said, dungeons (currently \\'The Shattered Throne\\', \\'Pit of Heresy\\', \\'Prophecy\\' which is free to all players, \\'Grasp of Avarice\\', \\'Duality\\', and \\'Spire of the Watcher\\') and raids (\"Last Wish\" from Forsaken, \"Garden of Salvation\" from Shadowkeep, \"The Deep Stone Crypt\" from Beyond Light, \\'Vow of the Disciple\\' from Witch Queen, as well as \\'Vault of Glass\\' and \\'King\\'s Fall\\' from D1 - both of which are both free to all players) are best experienced with a team, so don\\'t shy away from LFG group-finder options like the Discord, official app, or any number of other sites (just make sure to accurately describe your experience, level, and gear. \\'Tis only polite). \\n\\nOf the matchmade multiplayer offerings, I enjoy Gambit (PvPvE, reminds me of the Black Ops Zombies 4z4 mode done right), jump into the occasional Strike (PvE, matchmade fireteams running campaign-like missions), and have no interest in Crucible (PvP, it\\'s fine I guess, but I\\'ve never liked PvP that\\'s dependent in large part on personal progression - especially in the competitive modes like Trials of Osiris and Iron Banner)\\n\\nDon\\'t be afraid to ignore content - this is absolutely the kind of game where you can set your own goals. Want a specific exotic gun? Look up where it drops and focus on grinding that content. Want a specific roll on a random roll gun? Find the best possible farming (or crafting) method and go to town. Chase down some of the exotic questions that the game clutters up your quest page with, or just goof around doing things that you find fun while absolutely ignoring all signposts.\\n\\nSome stuff just won\\'t be explained in game. It\\'s not as bad as Warframe (much less need for a wiki) but some things are still obscured. Feel free to look up Xur (exotic weapon vendor who visits on weekends) and other hidden exotics tied to specific activities, lost sectors, patrol locations, or quest chains.\\n\\nFor anything that you can\\'t easily find online - reach out and find a sherpa. The community for this game tends to be pretty great, and enough of us have spent enough time leaning specific parts of it (e.g. raids) or just mechanics in general (\"What are random rolls? Which do I keep?\") that we\\'d be happy to jump onto discord (there are a bunch for PC, just check out the subreddit sidebar linked below) and answer any and all questions you may have. \\n\\nThe fact that a representative chunk of this game is free makes this the perfect time to dip your toes in without emptying out your wallet. Any other questions about this game as a product (\"Should I pay for DLC? Is Eververse worth it?\") should absolutely be researched elsewhere.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for a place to start with the F2P content, finish the intro missions in the Cosmodrome. New and returning players are semi-regularly upgraded to a new light level floor, but means that you can miss out on the \"learning the ropes\" parts of the game that come with working your way through the New Light quest chain or unlocking different subclasses. [As of Beyond Light, all of the campaign content through Forsaken are not currently accessible. Release order was Red War (launch campaign) > Forsaken > Shadowkeep > Beyond Light > Witch Queen, followed by the upcoming expansions Lightfall > Final Shape.]\\n\\nEyes up, guardian.\\n\\nFootnotes for people yelling at me in the comments:\\n-All of this is my opinion. Feel free to hold your own and disagree with mine.\\n-I generally enjoy grinding, looter shooters, FPS\\'s, and weird sci-fi space magic. Halo, Borderlands, Warframe, and CoD Zombies are some of my most-played and favorite games.\\n-As far as I can tell, anything that is not strictly subjective in the above is factually correct [as of Season of Plunder, with updates noted throughout. This game changes quite a bit over time, so make sure to do your own research before spending money on it]. If I\\'ve missed something, feel free to point it out in the comments and I\\'ll do my best to update this periodically. \\n-This review previously made mention of both content vaulting and weapon sunsetting. These practices have both been discontinued as of Season of Plunder. However, it is not clear at this if or when power capped or vaulted may return/be uncapped, if ever.\\n\\n-----------------\\nTL:DR: It\\'s good. Not perfect, but really good. And since it\\'s free, you can get a really good sense of if this game is for you without paying for any of it. You can play almost any activity solo pretty easily except for a handful of endgame activities. If you\\'re overwhelmed at first, just play through the Cosmodrome missions while you get your feet under you, or ask a veteran player for help.\\n-----------------\\n\\nSites to use (List was compiled at Shadowkeep launch, but most of it should still be relevant/useful)\\n\\n    \\nBeginner\\'s Guide (Current as of Beyond Light) - https://www.bungie.net/en/Help/Article/49007\\n\\nThe DTG Subreddit - /r/DestinyTheGame on Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/\\n\\nDestiny Item Manager (mange your inventory from your browser even while in-game, essential to avoid unneeded trips back to the tower) - app.destinyitemmanager.com\\n\\nDestiny 2 Checklist (Lists out everything to do as well as when it resets in-game) - www.d2checklist.com/\\n\\nLight gg (Database of in-game items, useful for looking up random rolls) - https://www.light.gg/\\n\\nBraytech org (Lots of overlapping features, but I really like their maps) - braytech.org/\\n\\nDatto (Destiny Youtuber / 24:02 Raider who posts lots of useful/educational content, including exotic guides) - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmAjbIecTIjTQctolYeuDw\\n\\nIf you\\'ve played D2 on another system, check out the CrossSave page (https://www.bungie.net/7/en/crosssave) on the Bungie net official site respectively to get all of your content and progression moved over to Steam.\\n\\nStory Recap up through Shadowkeep (Spoilers Destiny 1 / D1, and D2, obviously) (My name is Byf on YouTube: The Complete Story of Destiny!

       "  'review': \"2017: Bought Destiny 2 & Season Pass for like $100. Did pretty much everything there was to do in the base game, Curse of Osiris and Warmind. Was sorely disappointed about the lack of content and amount of things to do. I had a good time with it, but I ultimately wrote the game off as a loss and walked away. Laughed at the thought of a year 2 season pass after getting burned so hard the first time.\\n\\n2018: Pretty much forgot Destiny 2 existed.\\n\\n2019: Continued forgetting Destiny 2 existed until October 1st. Decided to give New Light a try because screw it why not. I'm completely overwhelmed with how much the game has grown and the sheer amount of things to do. The game did a full 180 from what it was last time I played it. Within a couple days of New Light I went ahead and bought Forsaken and Shadowkeep because I felt like Bungie finally earned my money. Looking forward to reaching the light cap again, min/maxing stats and going for perfect weapon rolls.\\n\\nI'm so glad Bungie chose Steam over Epic. If Destiny 2 had gone to Epic instead this review wouldn't exist and Bungie wouldn't have my money. So, well done there guys.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Is Destiny 2 a good game?\\nYes. It\\'s a solid FPS, with fun and mixed mechanics, fun abilities, and a good variety of weapons.\\nIt\\'s a game that I have spent over 2k hours on, was my first game to break 1k on, and is a game of which I have spent literal hundreds on, both for myself and friends.\\nIt is one of the only games I preorder content for.\\n\\nBut is it a game I recommend to new players?\\n\\nAnd this is what breaks my heart. Because I CANNOT recommend this game to new players. Not in it\\'s current state. Not unless things improve.\\n\\nSTORY:\\nThe story of Destiny is rich and indepth. We\\'re far beyond the point where it was hidden in lore cards. DLC has fully cast characters, often good narrative beats, and is generally a good time.\\nSeasons have gone from being a thing with loot and an activity, to near episodic stories told over weeks.\\nThe story in Destiny has never been better...\\n\\nAnd never been worse.\\n\\nDue to the DVC, new players are locked out of two whole years of story, and soon to be a third.\\nThey miss out on critical character arcs, and narrative context for current events.\\nWhat content remains is a mix of old and new, clashing content and contexts that leave new players confused as to who is who, and where they\\'ve gone.\\n\\nACTIVITIES:\\nThere are a number of core playlists that offer casual and hardcore experiences. There is endgame content for those who thirst for it. There are seasonal activities that offer a variety of fun side activities. There are bounties, challenges, and triumphs to chase.\\nBut there used to be so much more.\\nSome of the most fun, and most rewarding activities are gone, and whilst the newer activities are fun...\\nThey fail to live up to the past so far. And they too are soon to vanish.\\n\\nCOST:\\nThis is where Destiny fails the most.\\nYou can buy:\\n- DLCs\\n- Seasons\\n- Cosmetic MTX\\n- Transmog MTX\\nAll of this can add up to a high cost, especially for newer players coming in.\\nAll of the \"free\" content has been stripped away to the core playlists, of which you are occasionally locked out of for the week if you don\\'t have the DLC, (nightfalls).\\nFurthermore, instead of some parts of vaulted content becoming free, (subclasses, activities, weapons), Bungie is instead making this an EXTRA cost in the form of a mini DLC.\\n\\nAll of this results in a horrendous experience for new players, who starting out:\\n- Are facing a (Technically) pay to win economy, where subclasses and weapons are locked behind DLC paywalls in PVP content.\\n- Are left with no guidance of what they can, or cannot do.\\n- Are limited to only a handful of core activities, of which sometimes are unavailable.\\n\\nI cannot recommend this game to a new player, because the red tape of what is and isn\\'t available behind which paywall and how long it\\'ll exist before it\\'s gone, and what isn\\'t going...\\nIs all too much.\\n\\nPlease Bungie. Fix your sh*t.\\nOther games do transmog right. Other games let you keep your season passes once the season is over because you brought it.\\nOther games don\\'t strip away story and content from both the free and paid players.\\nThe DVC is a necessary evil, but with each \\'vaulting\\' the new players are left with less, and everyone is left with a bigger mess.\\n\\nI know you can make this right. Please do so.',\n",

There's no way for me to go back and play from the beginning. I have no cohesion in the story, and there are places I simply cannot access cause I never owned the expansion that has since been removed from the game. Why would I buy an expansion I cannot play just so I can get a landing point on one of the planets…\\n\\nNot recommended for new players in all honesty.

       "  'review': 'Edit: Jan 18, 2023: Bungie\\'s actually came out and made it a lot easier for newer players with more changes coming with the newest expansion on February 28th. To start, all armour mods are unlocked for everyone now by default. You used to have to visit a specific person every day to hope she sells the mods you needed. So that\\'s better. Coming with Lightfall more systems in the game are getting streamlined for easier understanding and working. Most of my issues here still stand, but as others have pointed out: buying from a third party site can be cheaper. I would like to amend this completely though. \"Unless something changes, which I don\\'t see happening soon..\" I will admit, I was wrong. These changes are very promising and I am hopeful that more and better changes will come. I would recommend trying the game and if you like it, look into buying some of the expansions.\\n\\nI know, I have 1200+ hours on Steam, I have more on Xbox before I moved over. This isn\\'t a meme though. I love this game, truly I do, there is nothing else like it. I have met so many friends, created so many memories, and got into a relationship because of this game. It\\'s amazing, incredibly fun, and a joy to millions. The problem is this game is so Anti-New Player it\\'s disgraceful. \\n\\nThe price to join is absurdly high, the fact that previous expansions don\\'t get price dropped to like $5 after a year is an insult. If you want to play everything in the game right now, you need to buy 3 Major Expansions that cost between like $40-$80 USD each. Then another $40 for the Season passes to get the content that arrives throughout the year. Then when the next major expansion comes out, it\\'ll cost you another like $100 to play that content. \\n\\nSay you can swallow that pill though and pick up the game. The tutorial is really, really bad and barely teaches you anything. It\\'s tedious to do on other characters if you wanted to experiment with other classes. And then once the tutorial is done, it throws you out into the world and says \"Good Luck!\". It might throw you into a seasonal story mission, but those are usually story based and require A. Knowledge of what\\'s going on. B. Only give you the first mission if you didn\\'t by the season pass. C. Puts you like 3/4ths of the way through an ongoing story of the year and refuses to make you play through it in order. If you\\'re lucky, it will just leave you with no clue of what to do, where to go, what any of the terms mean, nothing.\\n\\nSpeaking of terms, there is a lot. MMO levels and it is overwhelming with not a great way to learn it in game. You talking activities? Well you got: Patrols, Strikes, Nightfalls, Dungeons, Raids, Story Missions, Seasonal Missions, Gambit, Crucible, Trials of Osiris, Dares of Eternity. Wanna talk weapons? Kinetic, Energy, Special, Primary, Heavy/Power, Solar, Arc, Stasis, Void, Archetypes, Supers, Class Abilities, like 20 different Grenades, dozens of weapon perks. It tells you so little about what any of these mean. If you\\'re new, likely these are all just gibberish or mumbo jumbo.  \\n\\nIf you make it through all of that, and you start playing, and you start doing activities and browsing Twitter or Reddit you\\'ll eventually hit the hardest sell of them all. A lot of content has been removed from this game. A lot. Most of it was unused, but it also leaves anyone who picks up the game completely unaware of most things going on. Characters will address you as an old friend and you will have just met them 3 minutes ago. Characters will talk that have been out of the game for years now. People will make references to missions or levels or worlds that were incredible, but you\\'ll never be able to experience them. One of my favourite missions in the game is running through a destroyed human made structure, platforming and racing against time before it engages in a tough, all out firefight where you either run out of time or win and claim an incredibly strong gun. It\\'s gone. It\\'s been gone for almost two years now. It and so much else was just fun and FOMO just killed any chance of you, the reader, ever trying it.\\n\\nDestiny 2 has always been easy for me to describe. \"It\\'s the best game I will never recommend to anyone.\" Unless you have a friend helping you through and teaching you things, you\\'ll be alone in an ocean not knowing what to do next. Unless something changes, which I don\\'t see happening soon, I would avoid diving into this. Destiny 2 is incredible. There are so many great things I could have talked about: Gunplay is best in genre, Environments are breathtaking, raids are such a bonding experience with friends. But if you\\'re new to the game the cons will heavily outweight the pros, especially when so many problems are front loaded.',\n",

I REALLY miss the spoopyness of Shadowkeep and even Beyond Light was fun, but I feel like the game has lost the magic from the original campaigns, warts and all. I know they were running out of space (and so were our HDDs), but I just feel jilted that I can't go back and replay it all again, to discover the Dreaming City all over, to take on the Fallen and avenge Cayde, to kick Ghaul's ass and stand over the ruined Red Legion in victory...even delve into the Infinite Forest and look for Osiris (still the shortest/smallest DLC). Yeah, it may be nostalgia goggles, seeing only the good while forgetting the bad, but I miss it so damn much. Now? I have no desire to return. All my favorite rifles and exotics are nerfed into oblivion. The pinnacles I ground my ass off for are little more than dusty relics, and I'm just so...damn...tired.

       "  'review': 'Ok, I am going to give a brief but concise review on this wonderful bipolar game. \\n\\nIn summary: Most Destiny 2 players joking but correctly describe this game as \" I hate Destiny 2, its my favorite game\". \\n\\nFor those unknowing of Destiny 2\\'s gameplay loop, it may seem strange. But if you ever jump in, you will quickly understand why.\\n\\nThis is.... is a game for masochists. \\n\\nThere is soooooooo much to do and never enough hours in a week to do it all in. You will play for hours grinding away your life trying to get items in this game. \\n\\nIf you are a completionist OCD gamer, I STRONGLY ADVISE AGAINST PLAYING THIS GAME. This game will trigger you in all the worst ways. There are FOMO yearly events on top of the tri monthly seasonal content that will have you obsessively playing away your life trying to impossibly do everything as quickly as possible before the events/seasons expire. \\n\\nI am not even touching the predatory Eververse store, thats just pure FOMO glitter bait. And you cannot escape that in any triple A game anymore. Not even a listed con, just a fact. \\n\\nWhat IS predatory however is Bungie\\'s nebulous changes of the game every few months to a year. If you drop this game for a bit and come back several months to a year later, its a completely different game literally due to their new content vault system. \\n\\nThe part that makes it nebulous is that they are vaulting paid DLC content you have previously purchased and played. Which is a huge red flag for new forms of predatory DLC FOMO. Literal FOMO for DLC purchases on top of the usual season pass exclusivity content. \\n\\nOnce again, if you are an OCD completionist. DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME. It\\'s not good for your mental health. \\nIt\\'s a damn fun game, but you can get pulled in, in the worst ways. \\n\\nIf you enjoy this game casually, you are a stout soul because this game is for you. It\\'s fun for a few mindless hours, but for endgame playing, its a mindless grind that will have your soul wither away from either missing FOMO events because of IRL commitments or just the sheer amount of it you need to do to get the items you want to drop. \\n\\nI walked away from this game for my mental health and because I had an epiphany of how dangerous this game\\'s true predatory nature is. As well as the very dangerous DLC transaction model Bungie is positioning into place with Witch Queen. I refunded my WQ Digital Edition Deluxe because I am that concerned about it. \\n\\nIn conclusion: Fun game, but dangerous for people who have issues with controlling their impulses and time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Ah, Destiny. I love so much about this franchise. The gameplay, shooting, jumping, throwing lots of grenades, dismantling guns.. Destiny is a franchise I\\'ve spent a lot of time in. I\\'ve accomplished some of the hardest achievements in the game. Low man raid encounters, solo flawless dungeon completions, Conquerer seals, etc. \\n\\nMy honest opinion on this game is that it\\'s the best PvE FPS experience out there, ruined in multiple ways by problems that honestly shouldn\\'t be hard to fix or at least shouldn\\'t have been a problem for this long. I\\'ll start with the good:\\n\\n- Top tier gunplay and class feel\\n- The in game movement is an underrated part of the experience in my opinion, each class has it\\'s own traversal tech if you really want to git gud\\n- The raids and dungeons oh my god, they\\'re so awesome. Almost worth the time to invest into alone\\n- Some of the coolest moments in the history of online gaming have happened in Destiny (just look up the Whisper mission)\\n- The seasonal stories over the past year and current campaign as of writing this (Witch Queen) have great storytelling\\n- Guns. So many guns. Almost a gun for every situation. Most of us in the community have actual real nostalgia for the muscle memory of some of our guns that we can\\'t use anymore. \\n- Tons of content to check out for a new player\\n- Regular weekly updates from the dev team on Thursdays (TWAB = This Week At Bungie)\\n- On top of that, the dev team is pretty active on Twitter when the more unhinged members of the player base aren\\'t sending them death threats\\n- The soundtrack is incredible\\n- This is gonna sound like a meme but for real, the enemy AI in this game is pretty incredible. It can bug out sometimes of course but especially in harder content, different enemy types approach you different ways based on the weapons you use or the places you stand.\\n- If you like the Diablo experience of just mowing down packs of enemies, D2 can fill that spot in your heart\\n\\nNow for the cons:\\n\\n- We\\'re all addicted. You\\'ll see this whole \"lol 5k hours I don\\'t recommend but I\\'ll log back in tomorrow\" jokes and honestly, there\\'s some truth to that. It\\'s a grindy MMO game. Some elements of it are designed to keep you playing.\\n- All the classics are here: weekly drip-feeding of new content, bad communication on certain long-standing issues in the game for months and even years at a time, and a general level of jank and bugginess to the game that doesn\\'t really ever go away.\\n- Certain parts of the game are massively undeveloped, but forced into the same grinds every season. Crucible, the main PVP mode in this game, only just got it\\'s first new map this season (4 weeks ago at the time of writing) in over 3 years.\\n- Gambit, another main playlist, has been reworked like 4 times(?) since it came out and has somehow gotten worse each time. Also hasn\\'t had a new map since it came out, and has in fact actually lost content since it\\'s release.\\n- The whole game runs on peer to peer servers. This isn\\'t super noticeable for the majority of content in the game, as most of the content in Destiny 2 is team based PvE content or story missions etc, but this makes the PvP just generally unplayable to a lot of people who try it. Crucible can be very fun but there\\'s always a layer of \"oh wow I just headshot that guy with my reticle at least half of my screen away from him\"\\n- The cosmetic shop in Destiny 2, the eververse, is not one of the worst systems I\\'ve ever seen but it\\'s not super great either. It\\'s a pretty classic case of all of the best looking armor sets in the game, and virtually ALL weapon ornaments (weapon cosmetics in regular terms) being locked behind either a real money purchase or PRAYING it goes on sale for a currency you can earn weekly in game. Some cosmetics in the eververse haven\\'t been available for bright dust in years.\\n- Sunsetting, a big process that happened about 2 years ago, removed a ton of content from the game that most of us paid real money for. Entire expansion areas, weapons, quests, etc. were \"vaulted\"\\n- Bungie has a history of taking a really long time to fix more wide, sweeping issues with the game\\n- Bungie\\'s current season system has a few good elements to it, but overall the way they\\'ve designed seasons has become pretty stale over the past 2 years or so\\n- Bugs, man. Destiny 2 is always a buggy game, more than most in my experience. Most of us learn to live with the general jank, but it can be really frustrating sometimes. This season (Season of the Haunted) has been even worse than usual.\\n- The main 3 playlists, Vanguard Ops (short PvE missions such as strikes and battlegrounds), Crucible, and Gambit, are roughly 40% or maybe more of your playtime each season, yet they haven\\'t updated them in any meaningful way in at least 3 years. \\n- The pricing of this game. Realistically, D2 should\\'ve never been pushed as a free to play game. If you wanna access, and I\\'m not exaggerating, 95% of this game, you have to buy the expansions anyway. There\\'s no \"previous expansions\" bundle at a reduced price, and nowadays there\\'s even stuff like the 30th anniversary pack that gives you a dungeon and a rocket launcher for 30 bucks. It\\'s hard to get new players into this game when you have to open with \"well I know it says free to play but if you wanna realistically do the endgame content in this game (Trials/GM Nightfalls) you\\'ll have to spend like 200 dollars for all the expansions\"\\n- The UI is kinda slow and bad. There\\'s a decent amount of item bloat so if you\\'re like me and hate having like 10 new flashing items in your inventory, you\\'re gonna spend a lot of time holding your F key to dismantle things\\n\\nDestiny 2 is a game that is super great at it\\'s core, but tends to shoot itself in the foot a lot of the time. It\\'s a conflicted game, with most of the dev time in seasonal content seemingly going towards releasing new things and rarely improving the content we spend the majority of our time grinding. It\\'s also a game that\\'s going through a big transition period right now. Currently Bungie has made it pretty clear that they\\'re developing D2 for the long term right now, so some things are just being pushed to the side for the overall health of the future of the game. I don\\'t know how much I believe that, but if you\\'re reading this and you know what I mean when I say Path of Exile 2, I salute you. \\n\\nOne thing I haven\\'t really mentioned so far is that realistically, the best content in this game really requires a group of friends to enjoy at it\\'s fullest. I\\'ve been lucky enough to make some real long-term friends in my clan, and legitimately spend a lot of my time teaching new players how to do raids/dungeons/GMs. If you\\'re a solo player, many activities are either straight up impossble (raids) or they require significant time investment to complete solo (dungeons, GM nightfalls, etc). It\\'s a game all about building your vault of items so you have something for every situation. New weapon roll for this build, crazy armor roll with great stats, etc. This can take a long time and kind of creates this weird situation for newer players where they can just go months without getting a certain exotic weapon they need. \\n\\nTo cut things short, I love this game and have obviously spent a lot of time with it. I can\\'t currently recommend it to newer players unfortunately. If you\\'re returning, maybe. The Witch Queen campaign on Legendary difficulty is some of the most fun I\\'ve had with my friends in this game in years, and the seasonal stories really do get better and better. If you have friends and the disposable income, give the game a shot. If you want the game to respect your time, look elsewhere.',\n",

Just watch their Shadowkeep ViDocs, it's so down to earth, and their actions have proved it's not an act. They feel like distant friends more than developers, and you can tell they truly care about everyone involved in making/playing this game.\\n\\nNow as for me,\\n\\nI started as a solo player with nobody to try this new game out with (I Started in vanilla)\\nAfter I LFG'd and learned my first raid, I joined a clan and made some great friends who I had an absolute blast with. Then I realized raids were such a good time, I wanted to share that experience with people who might not have a group to do it with, so I became a raid sherpa/guide.\\n\\nAfter many runs, lots of Leviathan, mainly, I realized I had a knack for teaching these, and wanted to grow a community from it.\\n\\nNow, since starting my own clan and adding 40+ people, I have made so many new friends and had so many hours of fun with strangers coming together to play my favorite game ever.  I'm someone prone to feeling lonely, and seeing people I brought together have fun chatting and becoming friends makes me feel like I belong.\\n\\nThrough this extremely well-crafted game, I've been able to build a community of players where we all feel like part of a space magic family. If any of my clan members read this sappy post, thanks for being there. You're the best.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"While this is marked as recommended, this rating has some pretty deep explanation below. TL:DR at the bottom.\\n\\nThis is a review by a guy who has a total of almost 2,900 hours at the time of writing, cumulative from BattleNet and Steam eras. Would have definitely been a lot more if I wasn't stuck on console for several months and wasn't in school or work when (and after) Steam support was enabled.\\n\\nI love this game. The universe, the lore, in particular. I have the Chronicler title for a reason, and if I didn't love the game world, I wouldn't have spent even 1000 hours on it. Probably not even 500.\\n\\nThe gameplay and current meta as-is are rapidly degrading. Does it have fun areas? Sure. Is it good fun for new players? Probably. Is it good for players that have been playing the Destiny series since vanilla Destiny 1? Most current sources say no. So, I'll give my opinions below for someone just downloading, or someone purchasing the game's expansions.\\n\\nThe free base game lacks the activities of the current seasonal structure but still has public seasonal events (such as the current guardian games). Is it fun? For a bit. The free campaign is a bit grindy at certain parts and doesn't have the best loot drops, but I'd likely still have fun with it if I hadn't played it before.\\nThere are no REAL re-play-ability features in any of the campaigns, apart from strikes and crucible, but the former gets tiring quickly and the latter loses its spark from time to time. I don't remember if gambit is still free for everyone, but it's in the same murky water.\\n\\nThe paid expansions are interesting, kinda fun solo (for the most part) and definitely fun in a group. If you plan to get any, make sure you get Forsaken and/or Shadowkeep (the 'upgrade edition' is 50 bucks, cheaper than getting both individually). I enjoyed both, and they were fun for a while. Emphasis on a while. I'll get to that later.\\nKeep in mind that the other campaigns (red war, warmind, and curse of osiris) come first in the timeline.\\n\\nThe other main paid feature (currently) are the Seasons. Each season comes with a different suite of content that will (currently) be phased out at the end of the season to make room for new content. This INCLUDES all matchmaking activities and triumphs attached to that particular season, as well as the seasonal badges. \\nSundial is a perfect example of this. If you don't know what I'm talking about, google it. It comes from the most recent lapsed season.\\nThe current season is very, VERY bland and tedious. It revolves almost ENTIRELY around Bounty completions, small tasks that have no real impact on gameplay other than to mix up what you need to do with your arsenal to complete their contents. The grind takes an age if you don't have days straight to play, and ends up with very little satisfaction because of how little content there is.\\nThis is only a real issue if you've been playing the game fairly regularly. If you're new to the game and/or universe, this issue will be far less apparent, and may not even show up until the next season due to the plethora of content available for a fresh character to complete. Unfortunately, however, this content drought cycle has become a VERY strong pattern. Luckily one that does not make me pay much for it, but one that still hurts all the same.\\n\\nSeasons are purchasable via a 'season pass' or individually. I'm not sure if costs are the same either way, the option disappears after purchase of the current pass.\\nContents include the seasonal content alongside something similar to the season passes in Fortnight, Division 2, COD, etc. without being the useless cash grabs that those ones are. I actually like the system of the reward track accompanying new content rather than it being separate from that release's dlc. \\nAre there items that encourage play? Yes. Is there a way to buy levels in the pass? Yes, but the items within the pass do not a strong character make, and purchasing levels is FULLY LOCKED until the season is almost over, rendering the possibility of pay-to-win being almost impossible. \\nGranted, f2p content does not have a large pool of excellent weaponry, but that's been a fact since before the game went free-to play, and I don't think the difference in loot pools is nearly as significant as some people would claim. Especially with the new armor system.\\n\\nThere's also loot boxes, but you can earn (most of) the items in the Eververse through gameplay and bright dust bounties. Does this mean I'm advocating the required completion of bounties for most cosmetics? Hell no. I'm borderline pissed that there STILL aren't any cosmetics attainable through normal gameplay and activity completion apart from the prestige Leviathan ornaments.\\n\\nNow, would I recommend this game? This is very complicated, as you can probably tell from the above.\\n\\nFor a new player with low dedication / time allocation to the universe of the game? Yes!\\nThere's a plethora of content to enjoy out of the box, and the fact that it's only 60 bucks for '3 years' of content is quite the steal.\\n\\nTo a new or returning player familiar with the lore, universe and with a lot of time on their hands to complete everything the game throws at us? Probably not. It really depends:\\n- If you haven't played D2 yet, you might get a good couple hundred hours of play time out of the box between grinding out the campaigns and hitting endgame 'earlier than intended'. For those of you, the 60 bucks might be worth it.\\n- For people who played vanilla and/or forsaken and/or shadowkeep? I assume you know most of the problems I mentioned above, and know to wait and see what they plan to change with their content-cycling system before you come back. I definitely wouldn't recommend a return at this point unless you want to get some friends into the game, or want to grind out the seasonal activities to see where the story is leading.\\n\\nTL:DR; I recommend this game with a few heavy warnings:\\n\\n1- If you plan on playing this game for an extended period of time, expect heavy content drought between season releases.\\n2- If you are returning to the game, I would suggest waiting or doing research on how Bungie is changing content-cycle systems.\\n3- If you've purchased or completed shadowkeep and/or forsaken and plan on getting the seasons, do NOT EXPECT THE SEASONS TO REFLECT THIS AMOUNT OF CONTENT. Seasonal content is often particularly gimmicky. Particularly, overuse of bounty mechanics is a huge let down.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Fun shooter especially with friends, but the developers clearly do not understand how to get new players to stay. \\nThere are so many paywalls and the story is really hard to make sense of since you're thrown around to completely different campaigns randomly when starting the game. A lot of the story is hidden behind season (passes) so you also miss extra information that is quite relevant to the story, so next update comes and you're left wondering what the heck is going on. You can't just proceed through the timeline as it is and instead get spoilers about the story in every possible way. \\n\\nHow about an option to force the game to follow the main storyline in order?\\n\\nThey release new content and then they make old content useless. My inventory is filled with items that say they're completely safe to delete, so all that hard work to gather them is rendered useless. They don't want you to progress too fast.\\n\\nNever buy the DLC for full price. It's just not worth it. This has been an issue since Destiny 1. They originally cut off a lot of main story content and sold it off in DLC's. Actually, long before the DLC's were made available people were able to glitch into the DLC areas that were fully available in the base game, but were activated when you bought DLC. They then released Taken King and forced you to buy the whole game + DLC's again for full game price rather than allowing old players to buy just the DLC for cheaper. They then released the game currency and now you can spend at least 20€ to buy single armor skins or even more to unlock seasonal content during the year.\\n\\nTo fully enjoy the game you'll have to be prepared to spend hundreds on this game each year.\\nActivision was bad, but it feels like Bungie wants to be worse with their monetization.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I HAVE SPENT(or wasted): 1000 HRS OF MY LIFE ON THIS GAME (Which is nothing compared to some of you, but I like the number 1000)\\n\\nAnd therefore, I now feel like an entitled idiot who will now give you a review. Because after spending 1000 hrs of my oxygen and brain-cell power on this game, I feel like I know just little bit about it. A little bit. So without any more stupid rambling, here's my poorly constructed, naive, and somewhat botched review of Destiny 2...*clears throat*\\n\\nI joined the ranks of the Vanguard when D2 was on the ol' Battlenet, back when Activision still had its mits on Bugie's precious player base. And since its migration to the new platform here at Steam, there have indeed been some changes in latency, player-base, and server issues. Which to be honest, I think we all expected right from the word go.\\n\\nIf you are starting D2 as a new light with no background knowledge, it is important to remember that progressing through every task given to you is going to get you that light-level advantage when leveling up your guarding for the first time. This is where the first hiccup comes in.. Since we had the big Shadowkeep update, trying to figure out where to go next in your quests can be a small nightmare. \\nI spent an entire night with one of my clan's blueberries trying to help her figure out where to go before we succumbed to Googling the directions like tourists in a foreign city. If Bungie could potentially alter the quest tracking to perhaps make the major quests more linear in their pursuit, it'd be a whole lot easier for people coming in with no prior knowledge to the games mechanics.\\nThat said, If you need to go in blind, always check your destinations tab and hover over each planet where the flashing symbol is relevant to your quest. Each major DLC will have a symbol that you can follow through the Solar System.\\nTo get to the major stories: Amanda Holiday herself is where you will find the major story line journeys as you begin your career as a magnificent Space Moron.\\n\\nDestiny 2 I think appeals to people who have a good eye for lore and rich environments. The first thing that overwhelmed me was how detailed some of the biomes were. Especially the Dreaming City, which I think we can all agree is one heck of a place! It's pretty important to take note of those small details that Bungie has put in, down to reading the lore books that are there too. One aspect however that the current player base rolls their eyes at is the bounty system: Bounties are the backbone of the seasonal progress. And while I get that Bungo has tried to centre its play style around bounty completions, which can get repetitive, you do have to engage with this mechanic to build your light level.\\n\\nWhat D2 additionally excels at is creating a place where you can progress at your own speed, or have your fireteam/clan help you through certain areas that you need help with. The Clan system offered by D2 is a standout in that it allows you to connect your skills with that of others to accomplish tasks that are integral to the game. There is some content that does very much need a fireteam to be completed. But if you're a magical rootin' tootin' alien shootin' god of computers games, then running solo can always give you big results too. \\nThe main consensus is however that joining a clan is is your best interest. And that is because the gain you can receive in loot and bounty-clocking is a lot better when you have other Space Morons with you terrorising the universe.\\n\\n  Which brings me to the PVP element. *Deep sigh*\\n\\nAs a PVE enthusiast, I thought I'd never really delve into the PVP elements solely because my level of skill is appalling. I know Shaxx is very encouraging everytime I go to see him, but I'm 99.9% sure he's just being nice to poor little Miss D, who repeatedly falls of the map while she is scoped in.\\nWith how many people do have accounts solely for the purpose of playing Crucible Competitive and Trials of Osiris, you are going to find some of your matches are going to be simply dying repeatedly to laggy space-apes who are not going to change from using their shotguns. The toxicity level of these groups (which can sometimes be entire clans of elitist PVP lunatics) you really have to ignore if you want to try and push your way through the ranks. \\nHowever if you have a supportive clan (like mine) you'll find after a few rounds and finding your optimal loadout, you will enjoy it! \\nFollowing the meta on weapon types can help you get your feet in a match, but be aware you will not be liked for it! \\n\\nFinally we have the guardian classes themselves. \\nI feel this is absolutely worth talking about, and when you look at the pop culture around each class, you can't help but be entertained by it all. \\nWhat you play effects very much your play style: Hunters are often high speed, high damage dealing plucky little acrobats with big mouths. Warlocks are the bookworms with a ego who think they are the only reason the team didn't wipe on the boss. And Titans... well. We just like Titans because they are easy to pick and often have Crayola dust left on their helmets after too many snacks.\\nJokes aside, a well constructed fireteam/raid team/6 stack will have at least one of each class. This generally distributes the skill pattern quite well, and some of the most stress-free raids I've ever run have had a good balance of all 3.\\nAgain. However:\\nIf you want to run yourself through most of this game for the challenge, Titans do possess the skill trees that can more effectively push you through the more difficult situations you may find yourself in. Yes, we pick on them relentlessly, but they do play a big role in Destiny, and will continue to be fantastic Space Apes into the future of D2.\\n\\nWell. I've finished dinner and written 6 or so paragraphs, so I suppose this is where you end a review? I have no idea. As mentioned afore, I have the writing competency of a scientific calculator if you had taped fake nails on it and asked it to do a bachelor of journalism. \\nAll-in-all, I have immensely enjoyed this game, and will continue to. Yes this game has some serious bugs, but it is still lovable in its own buggy way. Have a go. Watch some guides. Get a good clan (come join ours it's the best). Go give the Darkness the stiff upper lip and have a gaff with Zavala. \\n10/10 for Creativity and Originality.\\n7/10 for Space Magic. \\n1/10 for Chonky Crayons.\\n8/10 for Gameplay.\\n11/10 for Good TImes!\\n\\nThank you for coming to my Ted Talk. No refunds on brain cells lost from reading all of this garbage. \\nSalut!\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b] TLDR: Silence Bungo, I do not wish to grind for rolls anymore, I wish to be happy... [/b]\\n\\n[h1] The New player experience [/h1]\\nIt\\'s 2022. You decide to check out this hot and cool shooter called Destiny 2. You log in, make a character, and watch the intro. It\\'s short, mysterious and the music swells as the title is revealed and you\\'re instantly immersed in the world. You then proceed to shoot and disintegrate some aliens throughout the intro missions and perhaps think to yourself: \"Wow! I get to wield space magic and use a multitude of guns, this gameplay is awesome. I can\\'t wait to play the rest of the game!\". As you put in some hours though, eventually, inevitably, it hits you: \"Wait, what am I supposed to do again? Whats the story? Who are these people? Is there a campaign I can play? Hold on what do you mean that intro was actually from Destiny 1? Where can I talk to other players? Should I buy an expansion? Which one should I get? Do I need a season pass? [strike] What the fuck is a zorpalod [/strike] .\" In short, its a bit of a mess for newcomers. For all its focus on an ongoing story and \\'living world\\' through yearly expansions and seasonal content, the very nature of seasonal story telling (which are usually ~ 10 weeks) means you\\'ll miss out on them if you were not playing then. Coupled with the content vault, where Bungie shelved/removed/deleted/dragged-out-behind-the-shed-and-shot roughly half the game around Beyond Light (2020) and will most likely continue to do so for older expansions (for the sake of game stability), means that it is difficult for new players to orient themselves in the game\\'s world if they don\\'t even have the opportunity revisit older content.\\n\\n[h1] The Shootin\\' [/h1]\\nAdmittedly, the game plays fantastically. No other game I\\'ve tried nails the feeling of popping some space demon\\'s head with an over-sized handgun and incinerating his pals with lightning like Destiny, and to add the ability of experiencing it with friends no less. Moment to moment gameplay is awesome, and encounter design for more higher level content is usually pretty well thought out, and its the reason why most people stick with the game even if they might complain about it in the same sentence. Most importantly, Bungie knows this. They know they have lighting in a bottle, and over the years it has been proven that however much the very vocal Destiny community likes complain of things, they will still continue to put in hundreds upon hundreds of hours. If you understand that, then you\\'ll understand why the game is monetized and priced the way it is. \\n\\n[h1] The Price [/h1]\\nDon\\'t be fooled, its really a \"free to try\" sort of situation. With season passes lasting around 3 months and the big dramatic expansions coming yearly, you\\'re expected to pay somewhere upwards of £80 pounds a year if you intend to keep playing and having things to do. Video games are an extremely cost-efficient medium and there are so many interesting games out there to buy for a fraction of the cost, giving you more value and enjoyment for the money you spend. Though what\\'s provided by the seasons and expansions is often well made and interesting, it is hard for me justify their full price tag under any circumstances. Coupled with this is also the enormous amount of microtransactions present in the game, from skins to emote to ships and anything of the like. Look I get it, its a long lost battle against microtransactions in video games, but if an in-game emote costs roughly as much as an season pass and the rewards and activities (repetitive as they may be) associated with it, I can\\'t help but feel a little ripped-off. At least a couple years ago one could say hey, at least a couple campaigns are free and playable, but those are long gone. Essentially, it feels like a subscription service and you should know what you\\'re getting into. \\n\\n[h1] The Loop [/h1]\\nAs is par for the course of the genre, the game eventually devolves into several repetitive gameplay loops in certain activities if you\\'re trying to achieve some specific goal/item. There is a lot of things to do in the game don\\'t get me wrong, but inevitably one may find themselves grinding for some particular goal, be it a good roll on a gun or whatever and just spend hours on it. In this case, Bungie is very good at making \\'boxes\\' for the player to tick, and playing Destiny 2 sometimes makes me feel like I\\'m some hamster in a wheel thinking he\\'s progressing somewhere, while simultaneously being afraid of missing out on timed content. It is what it is, and I suppose there is nothing wrong in finding enjoyment in that, but it is important to hold no illusions over what ~80% of the game actually is. \\n\\n[h1] The Closing Thoughts[/h1]\\nAbout the main reason I would recommend Destiny 2 to completely fresh players is the no cost of entry and its amazing gameplay. Try it out, the look and feel of the game is brilliant, and as long you are aware of what you are getting yourself into, you might even like it. But the price and nature of drip-fed content along with peculiarities too numerous to fit in this review such as the reliance on third-party apps/websites for basic functionalities like loadouts or LFG\\'s leaves a lot to be desired. It does not help the fact that money spent on the game\\'s expansions just feels wrong considering the inevitable removal of said expansions down the road. As I\\'ve mentioned before, most continue to play because they\\'re just not much that compares to the way Destiny handles. \\nIf you are a returning player however, I would definitely recommend checking the game out again. It\\'s in a fairly alright state at the moment, while some controversial mechanics like sunsetting are gone (though what has been sunset will remain that way), and you are probably used to some of Bungo\\'s hijinks by now.',\n",

       "  'review': \"TL:DR - Satisfying guns, good campaigns and TONS of content make for a very good FPS-RPG game!\\n\\nDestiny 2 has some of the best FPS gunplay on the market today, especially if you enjoy playing with friends. If that's all you care about then you might want to give the game a try. D2 has just recently begun transitioning to a more RPG-focused style of play so some things such as mods, perks and skill trees aren't fully fleshed out yet. That said you probably won't notice this unless you're in the end-game trying to min-max your build.\\n\\nThe early game can be a little challenging for new players because of all the various systems at play. Think of it as an easier Warframe or Path of Exile. There are plenty of resources to find out more about the game however, particularly on Reddit. /r/ShardItKeepIt for deciding which weapons to keep or discard. /r/CruciblePlaybook for PvP tips. /r/DestinyTheGame as the official unofficial subreddit for the game, and /r/Destiny2 for the memes. You can also look to /r/Fireteams or the Destiny mobile app to find people to play with.\\n\\nIn terms of free content, the first three campaigns are unlocked - [i] The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind. [/i] You also have access to all strikes (replayable mini-missions), PvP and PvEvP maps and modes, and all 9 planets/destinations. Additionally there are three raids available - [i] Leviathan, Spire of Stars, and Eater of Worlds. [/i] These are challenging but fun 6-man activities that require a lot of coordination and skill to beat. There's a lot more F2P activities as well that you will find once you start playing. They may not have all been amazing at launch, but after 1-2 years of updates and tuning they've never been more enjoyable.\\n\\n[i] Forsaken [/i] is the first paid DLC. Purchase of it comes with the raids [i] Last Wish, Scourge of the Past, and Crown of Sorrow, [/i] as well as several exotic weapons. Even if you don't or won't raid, it's worth it for the story alone. It's a sci-fi western tale of revenge for a dear friend, and is Destiny's highest narrative moment. \\n\\n[i] Shadowkeep [/i] is the second and newest paid DLC. While not as impressive as [i] Forsaken [/i] story-wise, there's still a lot of content to do especially considering how it's bundled with the current Season Pass. This is the story of how another ancient threat is discovered under the Moon. Sounds underwhelming yes, but saying anymore would require spoilers. The current Season focuses on an army of machines controlled by sentient milk that invades the solar system. Absolutely worth it. There's also a raid included here, [i] Garden of Salvation, [/i] as well as an upcoming dungeon.\\n\\nAll in all, there's an overwhelming amount of content here if you're a new player. It may be daunting, but play through the (optional but highly recommended) campaigns and you'll soon find yourself at home with the game. \\n\\n\\nEdit - Just adding that I've put 800+ hours into the game before it transferred to Steam. One of my favorite games of all time.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Likes:\\n- Lots of high quality content to do, especially for a free to play game\\n- Big immersive planets to explore and get lost in\\n- Both pve and pvp modes are fun\\n- The game is very pretty\\n- Sound design, voice acting, soundtrack are very good\\n- Core gameplay mechanics are polished and satisfying, such as gunplay and jumping and riding the sparrow \\n\\nDislikes:\\n-Unfriendly to new players because of the sheer amount of content they immediately have access to, with no clear indication of what the symbols on the map mean, combined with a disorganized quest menu, among other grievances. This is definitely a game where you should look up a quick beginner's guide as a newbie to point you in the right directions.\\n- No ingame guildfinder, you have to do that on bungie's website for some reason\\n- Hard to keep track of quests; you should be able to pin more than 4 quests at a time, the menu is disorganized and quests can get lost, and a lot of quests will leave you scratching your head until you just have to google how to complete it\\n- A few instances of missions bugging out forcing you to restart \\n- Waypoints could be better and less finicky \\n- Menus are not good in general\\n\\nRecommendation:\\nIf you like the idea of exploring, particularly in a space and science fiction setting, you might really enjoy this game. If you like shooting a bunch of things and chasing after loot, you will like this game. It can/does become a massive time sink however, which might be a good or bad thing depending on the player. \\nIf you are even considering playing this game, you should just give it a try because its free to play and you have nothing to lose. You might even really like it!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit: I have seen the developer update about the state of Destiny from Joe Blackburn. When the changes and future plans leading up to the next DLC take effect, I will be updating this review.\\n\\nEdit 2: Last played on June 26, 2021. I have since uninstalled the game with no plans of returning anytime soon. Anyone who gets triggered by my review, it\\'s at your own expense. Happy reading.\\n\\nTL;DR: largely NOT free-to-play, core content removal, planned obsolescence, lack of play-testing and playerbase neglect, has left a large amount of current players feeling disrespected and disinterested.\\n\\nAs much as I love playing this game, to eager, new players thinking about getting into it: DON\\'T. With the developer\\'s design decisions removing a large amount of the game\\'s content, putting it into a \"content vault\" for use in the future, in the game\\'s current state, that \"free to play\" button on the store page is a lie. A majority of the game is currently locked behind a paywall, with many core activities only accessible if players buy the DLCs. There is no reduction in price for the DLCs from Bungie\\'s side for this lack of content, so, buyers beware. You will be paying full price for DLCs that had about 80% of its content left unplayable or removed.\\n\\nLast year, Bungie implemented \"sunsetting\" gear, a.k.a. the concept of planned obsolescence in the game. It is already in effect. 2 out of the 3 latest DLCs have [expired] gear that is unusable in the current season. This gear will be updated to have a new expiration date next season, however, the [expired] gear that players collect now, will not have their expiration date(s) updated. Players who invested time into obtaining gear that they want from the activities in the 2 earlier DLCs, have to grind for it all over again. No reduction of material costs to upgrade gear have been taken into account for the introduction of sunsetting, removing any incentive to continue the grind. Destiny 2 content creators on YouTube have also eaten their words. After initially supporting the idea of sunsetting to reduce powercreep, a majority of them now agree that it is bad for the game.\\n\\nWith the new DLC, Beyond Light, the developers introduced a new playable subclass, Stasis. Basically magic space ice wizardry. In the game\\'s PvP modes, these new subclasses are absolutely over-tuned. From a FPS player\\'s perspective, Stasis has disrupted the core of FPS gameplay, by literally allowing players to be frozen where they stand, allowing for easy frags. Slowing, as a game mechanic, also causes players to not have their shots registered to hit their target, even when they have their sights directly on them. It was obvious that they released the new subclasses without play-testing, to trap new players into buying Beyond Light. Also, they removed several PvP maps, with no new modes, entirely neglecting their PvP playerbase. How about that, a regression of content, in a live-service game.\\n\\nI will continue to see this game through. But if the above sounds like good decisions made by developers who respect your time invested into their game and know what you want as a player, and not a game in its death throes, I envy your blissful ignorance.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll give you a little background on me as a FPS player before getting into this review. If you look at my most-played games, Borderlands 2 & 2.5 top the list, followed by MachineGames\\' first Wolfenstein games, then the Deus Ex reboot and Half-Life 2 sitting pretty at 200+ hours. DOOM 2016 is way up there as well as the original Rage. Honorable mention for Starbreeze/Vin Diesel\\'s \"Riddick\" games. Good stuff! Anyway, you get the idea. I like shiny shooty looty (mostly) story-driven single-player sci-fi games a whole lot.\\n\\nI am not a fan of multiplayer games, though. The last multiplayer arena shooter I played and actually enjoyed was one of the really old Unreal Tournaments. Let\\'s just say I was a bit wary about getting into this. I was peripherally aware of the drama surrounding the original Destiny, and I\\'ve never played a Bungie game before, so I was all set to ignore this until a friend peer-pressured me into checking it out. :P (And I owe him a beer or two for doing so!)\\n\\nSo if you\\'re like me, going into Destiny 2 blind, here\\'s the skinny: You are a post-human gun-toting space wizard and the Sol system is under attack by unpleasant dudes from another galaxy. Or maybe this galaxy. Doesn\\'t matter. There\\'s a lot of them and they\\'re ugly and you need to kill them or they\\'ll eat you and/or sign you up for outrageous student loans or something. The motives are always pretty clear for D2\\'s interplanetary Rambo pub crawl. In other words: yes, Private Hudson, it [i]is[/i] another bug hunt.\\n\\nLeveling in D2 is borrowed from, among others, Vermintide 2\\'s equipment-level system (i.e. your character gains levels by how powerful your gear is), and the equipment is doled out in drops from your kills and quest rewards, very much like Borderlands\\' loot-and-shoot mechanic. Lots of comparing rifles, helmets, boots, cheese, rocket launchers, cats, pianos, laundry hampers, etc.\\n\\nYou\\'ve got the skills to pay the bills, though, by which I mean D2\\'s class and skill system makes me unreasonably happy. You have 3 character slots, 3 races, and 3 main classes. Each of the 3 main classes have 3 elemental subclasses that you can switch to at any time, and each subclass can tweak their individual skills nearly on the fly. In one of my favorite MMOs from way back when, you could slot in certain skills from any of the classes in the game, on top of your main class/job, and the amount of gameplay customization this provides is significant. You get to tweak the skills of your chosen subclass even further with either the Forsaken or Shadowkeep expansion. (The consensus seems to be that Forsaken is the better value, FYI.)\\n\\nCharacter customization (face, hair, etc) is a bit bare, but it\\'s not a big deal as there is a massive amount of gear customization. Dye your sword (yes, there are 3rd-person swords) pink, paint your helmet black or green or whatever the hell you want with semi-rare drops called \"shaders\"; more infrequent drops include specific skins for specific gear, which you can also dye some insane color. Once you acquire a certain shader or skin, and you use it up on a trash piece of gear... you don\\'t have to hope for another random drop of the vanity item. Your pickups are all stored in a \"collections\" tab, where you can just grab them again for varying amounts of in-game (not cashy money) currency. Score!\\n\\nIt\\'s a system that reminds me of Assassin\\'s Creed: Odyssey\\'s persistent weapon/armor skins (whatever gear you picked up, its skin was saved to your character so you could always switch them in and out as per your fancy). Small thing, but showing consideration to the player and their time is sadly not something you always find in AAA games.\\n\\nD2 is huge. It takes place across the solar system that we all know and love, no matter how many planets you think are worthy enough of being called planets. This seems like a minor point, but getting to bounce around a bunch of worlds that you probably know the names of by heart, and seeing such stunning representations of the beauty of our sister planets... it all creates a deeply satisfying and familiar hook so you\\'re not bored to tears by your 50th visit to planet Flibbertygibbet. And it also helps that Bungie hires writers and scriptwriters who clearly know what the hell they\\'re doing, because for once, for ONCE, I\\'m not always skipping cutscenes or dialogue -- most of the quests feature a lot of good voicework and the script is quite funny a lot of the time.\\n\\nThat may or may not be due to the fact that there are [url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6721356/fullcredits]a lot of famous people providing voiceovers[/url] in D2. Your mileage may vary, of course, but this is a game with massive production values and it shows.\\n\\nWhat else... gunplay is freaking fantastic. I haven\\'t enjoyed visceral shooting like this since Wolfenstein or DOOM 2016. That\\'s the other thing that I\\'m constantly surprised by, that this is a really great shooter all by itself. In the open-world maps your player transitions seamlessly from open-world to instanced sections of the maps, meaning that once you enter a named cave or a ruin or whatever, no one else can come in with you other than your party, so if you really hate playing in a massively online blah-blah, you have plenty of options. Aside from raids and the like, it\\'s a very solo-friendly game as far as I can tell. D2 may borrow from the loot-and-shoot school of gaming but they took the time to build an astounding selection of guns, many of which feel and sound unique enough at lower tiers to give you a lot of versatility when you\\'re still starting out.\\n\\nAnd to top it off, the game community is really quite pleasant! Your mileage may vary, again, but there\\'s some obvious love for this game in the playerbase which comes out often in random interactions.\\n\\nIn summary: if you\\'re looking for a new addiction, and you like a little gun with your space opera, get stuck in. You may regret it if you have one of those \"social lives\" that people keep whispering about! Worth a try if you don\\'t. :P',\n",

       "  'review': 'You start playing destiny 2 . Eventually you will come across a weapon/armor piece that you really want to use in your builds. You start your grind for that gear . After hours & hours of grinding , it still doesn\\'t drop. At this point you become furious , even over the smallest of things . You start hating everything about the game & start criticising developers for every decision they have made. You think of how bad & unbalanced pvp is & especially with stasis , how the endgame is literally a grindfest , how the drop rates for many weapons is so low, how you get error coded for no resason , how the implementation of so many things (like recent transmog system in S14) is bad & how every step the dev\\'s take in the game makes it more worse , you start noticing how dev\\'s are paywalling most of the things . At this point you feel like every hour you invested in this game was a waste and that the dev\\'s dont respect your time at all . But remember while you are thinking of all these things , you are still grinding for that gear , you are still doing that activity . You dont want to stop grinding , At that point you say to yourself , I will invest another few hours and get that gear than stop now & waste all the hours that I invested today.  \\n  \\n You invest another couple of hours in grinding & at the end of the day ( or tomorrow, cause u wont stop, lol ) , you finally get that gear . Now you feel satisfied . You open your character menu and check that weapon . You are completely stunned/surprised . The weapon that you just got has absolute god tier perks in every column ( we call them god rolls in destiny ) . Its the weapon roll that your friends were chasing and still haven\\'t got . There\\'s a guy out there who invested 100+ hours in trials , has 50 flawless & still doesn\\'t have god roll igneous but you get it first try on ten losses by jumping off the map. Now you are completely happy & immensely satisfied. You never felt this kind of happiness even when you graduated . You know that if u show it to your friends , they r really gonna get jealous & that\\'s why you really want to show them . You get a raid exotic first try & your fireteam leader kicks you because of that , cause he still hasnt gotten it in 150 clears . But him kicking you in this case actually makes you more happy cause you know he is jealous of you. \\n\\n Now that you have got the god roll , the next phase starts . You think of all the positive things about the game , how it has so many activites that you can play endlessly with your friends and never get bored , how the game\\'s replayability factor is good , even though the endgame is grindfest , you still feel like doing it & never get bored of it, how the dev\\'s always keep saying \" we are listening \" & keep fixing stuff/try their best. How you can exploit bugs/cheeses in this game without getting banned cause bungie themselves said its their fault if such bugs exist, how the community (inspite of being toxic many times) comes together to donate & help whenever a charity is conducted . Now that you are happy you start playing the game with a positive vibe until you set your eyes on another weapon . \\n\\n The whole game is just you shifting your thoughts from positive to negative & vice versa from time to time , contradicting yourself & your own thoughts , but you will still keep playing & playing  & playing . You will eventually reach a point where you will have evrytg , & you dont feel like you need any new things anymore, but you will still keep playing. You wont know why you are playing the game anymore but you will still keep playing. You will get up at 3 AM in the midnight half asleep or sleep walking , load up destiny 2 , go to all vendors , collect their bounties and start doing them , all with your eyes closed . How you ask ? cause at  that point you would have already done each of those bounties a thousand times , so you would know subconsciously which bounty it will be from each vendor & even its objectives. \\n\\n I read this in one of the other reviews - \" If you are playing this game only for pvp , then you are being delusional \" , that perfectly sums up the pvp experience . You will feel like pvp is balanced & unbalanced at the same time . Unbalanced? stasis of course . You might have the best aim in the world , sm hunter with with a shuriken will freeze you & knock you out or a titan with his melee will throw you off the map or a warlock with his infinite super glitch will keep killing you until the round/game ends . Bungie did fix the warlock glitch , how? by disabling it of course. Balanced ? again stasis . You will run against a lot of hackers on pc , and stasis is again the countermeasure . The cheater might have infinite health , the titan will throw him off the map with his melee, He might have perfect aim , well he cant shoot if he is frozen , can he?. Pretty ironic that I talked about actual legit players while referencing unbalance & cheaters/hackers while referencing balance . That\\'s the power of stasis.\\n\\n  So to sum it all up , do I recommend this game ?\\n - Well YES , but actually NO.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Despite the troubled past of the series (for which both Bungie and Activision share the blame), the new free-to-play version of Destiny 2 on Steam (also known as Destiny 2: New Light) is one of the best online games you can play in 2019. \\n\\nOther than Forsaken and Shadowkeep, all of the previous expansion content along with all of the maingame content is now completely free. This amounts to a massive volume of places to explore, quests/adventures to do, routine patrols or public events as well as PvE missions/raids and a huge smattering of PvP content too. \\n\\nAnd in general, Destiny 2's world and story, as well as the visual design, graphics and soundtrack are among the best I've ever seen in a game. As far as gameplay goes, the game offers some of the best gunplay, moment-to-moment game loop and mechanics I've ever encountered in a game. \\n\\nDestiny 2 is a must-play and one of the best games to come out of Bungie ever since Halo 2.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'After probably what is more than 1000 total hours spent playing this game and recommending it to friends, I unfortunately can no longer conscientiously recommend the game to [i]anyone[/i]. This will be a long review below the TL;DR.\\n\\nTL;DR: A predatory 4-layer monetization model, lack of respect for player time investment, removal of past content that you likely paid money for, massive Fear of Missing Out (FOMO) content implementations, player retention mechanics, and heavily skewed update rollouts in favor of slowing player progress over fixing bugs and balance issues.\\n\\n[h1]Monetization - The Big One[/h1]\\nA Bungie employee has confirmed that with the launch of Witch Queen, both dungeons scheduled to release for the duration of the Witch Queen expansion will be sold separately for those who choose not to invest in the digital deluxe version of the game. So, for those who [b]do not[/b] like to preorder games/expansions, which is probably quite a sizeable amount of the playerbase, there will be 3 layers of paywalls in order to play all of the content releasing during Witch Queen. You will be expected to pay the $40 upfront for the expansion, an additional $10 for each of the seasons you choose to purchase (totaling 4 seasons), and another undisclosed amount for each of the 2 dungeons you decide to purchase ($5-20? each). So, in total, if you choose not to purchase the digital deluxe version of the game, you can expect to pay anywhere from $90-120, which doesn\\'t even include the separate Anniversary Pack, which costs an additional $25.\\n\\nOn top of the triple layer content monetization, there is the Eververse store (a cosmetic shop), which is estimated to rake in a few hundreds of millions of dollars each year. \\n\\n[h1]Player Retention, FOMO, and Lack of Respect for Player Investment[/h1]\\nThe games \"seasons\" are designed to keep you coming back to the game each week and keep you playing for as long as possible. Content is trickle-fed to you each week with story updates and seasonal challenge updates. The story additions usually take just a few hours to complete, but the seasonal challenges can take several days to complete each week\\'s new challenges. At the end of the season, if you complete roughly 95% of the season\\'s total challenges, you get a large drop of Bright Dust (free currency for the Eververse store). Large enough, in fact, that it seems like extreme value to attempt to complete the final challenge. But let\\'s say you didn\\'t quite get there and missed out on finishing a few challenges, but the season is over. Can you just complete them later? [b]Nope[/b]. You missed out. [b]Too bad[/b]. Didn\\'t get to see the last bit of the story from the season that just ended? [b]Too bad[/b] (some do persist). Guess you\\'ll need to watch some YouTube videos to figure out what you missed. This alone gives a severe sense of FOMO. You [b]HAVE[/b] to be there for the content or else you\\'ll miss out and it will, quite literally, never come back.\\n\\nBungie has now taken to adjusting gun perks between seasons as well. If you were grinding for that perfect shotgun with the perfect perks, but never quite got it before they decided to change the perk pool, [i]oh well[/i]. Other players now have that perfect roll that may even give them an edge in PvP, but you missed out because your luck wasn\\'t quite good enough.\\n\\nIf you want a particular Trials of Osiris weapon and weren\\'t lucky enough to get it with focused rolls, good luck. Your chances of getting that particular weapon with the perks you want from a randomly rolled Trials engram can range anywhere from 0.02% to 0.1%. You could grind this gamemode for literal days, weeks, maybe even months (since it\\'s only around on particular weekends) and still not get the weapon you want.\\n\\n[h1]The Destiny Content Vault[/h1]\\nAs of right now, all of the original D2 storyline content, as well as the entirety of the first and second expansions to be released for the game, are unplayable, because they have quite literally been removed from the game. With the upcoming release of Witch Queen, the story of The Forsaken expansion will also become fractured as a story essential zone is vaulted. Speaking of Forsaken (which, as I said, will be unplayable in 4 months), Bungie is still, [b]STILL[/b], charging $25 for that expansion. Some people will purchase the expansion for the $25 price point, the expansion will become free in December, frustrating these people, and then the content will be flat out taken away from them on February 22, 2022. Paying for content with the knowledge that you will no longer ever be able to access it sometime in the future is infuriating.\\n\\nThe Destiny Content Vault has led to a completely fragmented new player experience. Which, by the way, the DCV was implemented right after Bungie overhauled the new player experience. A bit counter-productive, right? New and returning players no longer have a connected experience when they play Destiny. They are dropped into the middle of a fragmented world and story that they will only understand by doing homework in the form of watching YouTube videos.\\n\\n[h1]Bugs and The Development Focus/Pipeline[/h1]\\nPlayers have been asking for new Gambit and PvP maps for years. Do they get them? [i]No[/i]. Players have been asking for a Gambit overhaul for years. Has it happened? [i]No[/i]. Sometimes PvP balance gets way out of line and particular guns become exceptionally strong, especially with the right perk roll. Surely it\\'ll get patched quickly, right? [i]No[/i]. In fact, the timeline it takes for balance updates is on the scale of months. Not days. Not weeks. [b]MONTHS[/b].\\n\\nYou know what [b]DOES[/b] get fixed exceptionally quickly? Exploits that interfere with player retention mechanics. Players found a way to quickly farm a resource 10x faster than the intended route? [i]Patched within the hour[/i].\\n\\n[h1]Stockholm Syndrome/Boiling Frog and Sunk Cost Fallacy[/h1]\\nSo, if things are this bad, why are there still so many people playing? I have a few theories and I speak from personal experience.\\n\\nI was victim to sunk cost fallacy. I paid for the digital deluxe editions and when I inevitably got burned out on the game, I would still play the new seasons under the thought process of: \"Oh, I paid for them, I really should play them. Otherwise, I\\'ve wasted my money.\" This is the sunk cost fallacy. \"I\\'ve spent money on this game, I [b]HAVE[/b] to play it to get that value.\" \"I\\'ve invested so much time into this game, I [b]can\\'t[/b] stop playing now or that will have all been for nothing.\" During my stages of burnout, never once did I load up the game actually excited to play, it was only to continue making my investment and to satiate the Fear of Missing Out.\\n\\nThen there is Stockholm Syndrome. People who are literally so addicted to the game that Bungie could make any negative decision in the world and these particular players would still try to justify Bungie\\'s actions. You see this quite clearly with the new dungeon monetization model. \"It\\'s not so bad, it means we may get even higher quality content!\" \"This doesn\\'t matter to me, because I\\'m a diehard Destiny 2 fan who [b]ALWAYS[/b] buys the digital deluxe version of the expansions. Who cares!?\"\\n\\nPlace a frog in a pot of water and slowly increase the temperature until it dies, none the wiser (Boiling Frog). Bungie is doing this by squeezing your wallet with every single piece of content they offer. When season passes became a thing: \"They need the extra money for dev purposes, it\\'s fine.\" Dungeons historically were included with either a season pass or an expansion. Now, that is no longer the case. On one side you have players saying that this is over the line and the other side arguing that \"it isn\\'t so bad, they probably need development money\" (AKA the boiling frogs). Right now, it\\'s dungeons, but who\\'s to say that in another year\\'s time exotic quests (which are also currently included in season passes) won\\'t also be monetized separately?',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]PREFACE:[/h1]\\n\\nI will start this by saying that you might find yourself looking at my \"hours played\" tag and either groan or stare confused. Yes, undoubtedly I play D2 quite a lot. I was going for an inside joke regarding Bungie, the parent company, as they LOVE the number 7; it\\'s one of their [i]leitmotif[/i], you could say. So I wanted to post this review when I hit the 7777h mark.\\n\\nThe latest edit just made the joke null. Oh well...\\n\\n[h1]THE REVIEW:[/h1]\\n\\nOk, now to the review. So I played this game even before it was brought to Steam, back in the days it was on Blizzard\\'s Battle Launcher. I like to think that I\\'m a veteran in terms of the information I have on the game, both lore-wise and mechanics-wise. (Even if I\\'m still sh*t at PvP, but that\\'s between us...). So I will pass onto you some of the main things to know about the game before starting it. And I hope you will enjoy it!\\n\\n[h1]THE GAME ITSELF:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]Plot:[/u]\\n\\nYou died. We don\\'t know how long ago. We don\\'t know in what manner you died. We don\\'t know what your name was, what you did during your life, who your relatives were. But we know that you are dead.\\n\\nYou are then resurrected one day by a small sentient drone-like A.I. entity called a Ghost. There are many Ghosts roaming the lands in search for their Guardian, as it is called. You are one of those. You are a Guardian of Humanity. You can wield various Light powers granted through this Ghost by a mysterious \"moon\", called the Traveler. This moon is floating above Earth, above the Last City. The last place where Humanity still stands.\\n\\nThousands of years in the past, a cataclysm called the Collapse happened in our Solar System, where the human race was driven all the way to the Last City on Earth by the forces of Darkness. Before that time, humanity was an interplanetary species. Colonizing most planets and moons from our System and already sending colony ships in the outer space.\\n\\nYour main goal now is to defeat the enemies in our planetary backyard.\\n\\n[h1]CHARACTER CREATION:[/h1]\\n\\n[u][b]/!\\\\ Warning! /!\\\\[/b][/u] You have to know this before actually creating your character. Its appearance can\\'t be changed after it has been created. You\\'d have to delete that char. completely and that\\'s not something you\\'d probably want to do if you had sunk enough time into that char. over time. (You can always keep your mask on in social spaces if you don\\'t want your face to be seen.)\\n\\nI will provide here the main options you have when choosing your appearance, so that you can make an informed decision on what you\\'re looking for.\\n\\nFirst of all, you can make 3 characters on your account. They can be either one of each class (Titan, Warlock, Hunter) or any combination of those: 2 of a type and 1 of another; or 3 of the same if you want to. But it\\'s not really worth going for anything other than 1 of each.\\n\\nSo you have 3 classes, 3 races and 2 sexes = 18 permutations.\\n\\n[u]The Classes:[/u]\\n\\n          - [b]TITAN[/b]: the \"paladin\" or \"barbarian\" of the game, in D&D terms. Titans are known for their barricades, that absorb incoming damage for a brief time. they are more of a defensive class, but like the other 2, they have offensive capabilities as well.\\n          - [b]WARLOCK[/b]: the \"mage\", \"wizard\" or well... \"warlock\" of the game. Warlocks are the ones that can heal or empower you in various ways. their powers are for both support and a strong offensive.\\n          - [b]HUNTER[/b]: the \"rogue\" type. simple as that. sneaky and deadly*.\\n\\n*depending on who you ask. :P\\n\\n[u]The Races:[/u]\\n\\nNow, the races don\\'t impact your playstyle all that much (just some occasional dialogue changes in certain Story missions). But based on the lore, I will explain the races for you, in case you are interested in going for any in particular.\\n\\n          - [b]HUMAN[/b]: ...ye. I hope I don\\'t need to elaborate.\\n          - [b]EXO[/b]: an Exo is a robot with a human consciousness inside them. it\\'s not an A.I. or Cyborg. they used to be an actual human before they had their mind transferred into an Exo frame so that they can extend their lifespan indefinitely. they behave the same as a normal human. they can eat, even if they don\\'t need to for survival. it\\'s just for them to keep a semblance of normalcy.\\n          - [b]AWOKEN[/b]: like a human, but purple................................ ok ok ok. it\\'s more that just that. the Awoken were created millennia ago, all at once, when a colony ship on it\\'s way out of the Solar System was caught between a major fight between the forces of Darkness and the Light. from that struggle, the humans onboard were sent through a black/worm hole into another pocket dimension called the Distributary. they were all transformed, imbued with both Light and Dark. thousands of years later, part of those Awoken exited their dimension back into ours, either because they were exiled or because they went on scientific expeditions, while the rest stayed in their homeworld.\\n\\n(I can\\'t make the Exos and the Awokens justice with just these short descriptions, so if you ever get interested in knowing more about them, I recommend you read the lore on them, either in game, on a website called Ishtar Collective, or watch some YouTubers like \"My name is Byf\" or \"Myelin Games\" for fun and indepth lore explanations.)\\n\\n[h1]THE SOCIAL ASPECT:[/h1]\\n\\nMost of the game content is better played with others in a team (or a so called, \"fireteam\" ingame), but you can find enjoyment in being a lone wolf too. You can invite people you see roaming around the social spaces or the various destinations as your friends, but usually you are more likely to get accepted by them if you are doing an activity at the time with said people. I encourage you to make friends, because it gives you so many benefits to your game experience in the long run.\\n\\nNow, there are some CONs in relation with this aspect of the game. One of them is that it\\'s usually hard to find through the game people that want to do the same activity as you. Some of them have matchmaking and there\\'s little to no issues in that. Usually these same activities, but on their harder difficulties, don\\'t have any matchmaking, so you need to go in with a team already formed beforehand. That\\'s were LFG sites or Discord servers come in handy. (I recommend discord.gg/D2LFG, I think it\\'s the actual biggest LFG server for D2.)\\n\\n[h1]QUALITY OF LIFE TOOLS:[/h1]\\n\\n- D2 Companion App (official mobile app that can help you keep track of your pursuits and allow you to get bounties from the ingame vendors without going all the way to them to purchase them)\\n\\n- blueberries.gg (this website will explain more aspects of the game to you if you ever have questions, as a new player)\\n\\n- Destiny Item Manager (DIM) (browser app which is your #1 best friend. it\\'s indispensable for a normal D2 experience)\\n\\n- BrayTech (my favorite app of them all. it can be used to keep track of the progress and timer of your bounties and quests you have in the game at the time, see triumphs and their progress as well, plan what challenges you want to complete in game for better loot. and many more features. you can also customize some areas yourself)\\n\\n- light.gg (website which shows you any item in the game and its commonality. it crowd-sources the perk rolls of any weapon based on what the community uses the most - it\\'s decent for showing you the better rolls, but not necessarily in all situations)\\n\\n[h1]PROs:[/h1]\\n\\n- gunplay, abilities and movement are very satisfying\\n- new content coming often\\n- a huge and varied community, where the parent company (Bungie) encourages community creation and interaction\\n- extensive lore\\n- great endgame content for PvE (dungeons, raids)\\n- TELESTO\\n\\n[h1]CONs:[/h1]\\n\\n- the new player experience is lacking; find experienced players that are willing to help\\n- quite addictive in an unhealthy way\\n- you can enjoy the game without buying anything, but in many cases buying the DLCs feels necessary\\n- DCV (you\\'ll understand)\\n- TELESTO',\n",

       "  'review': \"I wanted to do this for a while.\\nGameplay and (audio-)visual Destiny 2 is an incredible game. The feeling and look of the weapons, how you interact with the world around you is something you’ll find just very rarely. Every Element of the world is visually thought out and the sound design of the game, especially with the newest game extensions just superb. How you can customize your own character can fascinate for hours and lets you tell your own whole story.\\nThought the rest:\\n\\nI started back in December of 2019. A friend asked me if I wanted to join, I never really played an MMO like Destiny 2, so I thought okay, lets give it a try. And I was Instantly hooked.\\nIt was just this mysterious Game where you could explore what felt like an entire star system for itself and just explore the different worlds, each telling a different story.\\nAnd this game had a certain kid of magic. There just was so much to discover, the moment when a Quest for an unknown exotic weapon popped on your screen with special Activities and gorgeous new places bound to it. And oh boy the Raids. The Leviathan Raids were visually just stunning.\\n\\nAnd then, in the November of 2020 Bungie just removed all that magic the game had for me. With the new Beyond Light DLC they decided to remove 40% of the explorable Planets, \\nThey removed activities that just made the game what it was,\\n3 whole campaigns, \\nbeloved activities like 'The Whisper’, ‘Zero Hour' the whole Black Armory and its weapons, and screw it, I even miss the ‘Escalation Protocol’\\n\\nAlso, they went removing 21 of those quest for exotic weapons, that made a huge part of the game,  while leaving 6 in game. Those Weapons are still obtainable in game, though to obtain them you need to grind out in some cases a dozen hours just to get enough materials to buy a certain one.\\nAdditionally they took 5 of the 7 Raids from the game.\\nAnd what they added were 2 Planets, one being a recycled one from the previous game. \\nWith Stasis they gave us a new subclass element, players could abuse, which made the PvP-section of this game the most obnoxious part of the game for 7 Months while fucking up the weapon Meta again.\\nMaybe they achieved to better out the game with new contend and new Ideas coming with each Season?\\n\\nThey did somewhat. I mean they added 2 new exotic Activities to get an exotic weapon from. Now with random rolls and perks. So if you aren’t happy with you EXOTIC WEAPON you need to grind and repeat an activity that is getting repetitive after 3 times.\\nwhile talking about repetitive. \\n\\nThis is the Vendor-thing of season 10\\nhttps://ibb.co/bzXbSJC \\nHere we have one of the 3 main Vendors of the new DLC\\nhttps://ibb.co/0Ff8kyf \\nThe main Vendor of season 12 in some smaller form\\nhttps://ibb.co/ZdQP4zd \\nthe Artifact u need to unlock if you want any seasonal Gear (12) that is not gained randomized\\nhttps://ibb.co/Bt3M8ss \\nand look what we got for the current season (14) again :D\\nhttps://ibb.co/gZVPHnV \\n\\nOf course they added a lot of weapons after they also struggled with this after Beyond Light and tbh, some of the are incredible fun.\\n But hey, we got the 6 new rewards for one of the pinnacle activities of the game,“Nightfalls” \\n\\n all of them being old, recycled Destiny 1 weapons with 2 more incoming.\\n\\nThe Raid added with the beginning of Season 14 is returning one from D1.\\nThe weapons added for one of the harder PvP modes, Iron Banner, in the last 4 seasons are 2 new designed and 8 being recycled back from the earlier days of this game.\\n\\nBut I have to admit that it is pretty hard to come up with new content consistently for 4 years now, especially with a new season coming every 3-4 months. \\nAnd its not like they didn’t delivered content, we got a really good new raid, a slowly growing base of good and creative activities and a high new arsenal of powerful and just enjoyable weapons.\\n\\nI just personally feel like this game just isn’t about the fun, the world itself anymore, \\nthe whole goal of players now is to get a high enough light-level to do something they did in the past season already, just to instantly start grinding for the next season’s level-cap again.\\nMost of the weapons you'll find, will get dusted in your vault at some point.\\n\\nThat all is why I really don't want to recommend this game anymore, it is just grinding in its purest form, and everything about this game has just got so repetitive.\\nBut to be honest the game might just have burnt me out on a personal level.\\n\\nThere is one magical thing that survived all of Destiny’s Lifetime and is the reason I am launching the game at certain days. The Community.\\nThe Community is what makes this game maybe so special. I met incredible people, made friendships and began to love the playerbase. There may be some cheaters in the PvP parts of the game and in some rare cases people who get toxic, but the playerbase in the most parts just is so incredible wholesome, helpful and cooperative.\\n\\nTho after all I am thankful for all the memories I could make with that whole thing\\nI just want to thank everybody, I am happy that I met all of you :)\\n\\n\\nhave a good one y’all\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nthe fun thing about this whole rant is that, almost a year ago, even before BL released another D1-Vet left the game and told me that he just felt like the game has gotten too grindy and repetitive.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Forsaken gave me hope that Destiny 2 would finally achieve the greatness that Destiny 1 was after it\\'s last DLC. Even more so, when Bungie finally split with Activision which made me think at first that everything is going to be great from now on. I thought Shadowkeep was not just going to be a good DLC, but also a positive turning point for the series so I immediately bought the entire Season Pass bundle. But sadly Destiny has disappointed me much more than it has positively surprised me\\n\\nThe new Seasons just suck. The new \"content\" isn\\'t content, let alone new content. You basically are just playing old stuff to earn old stuff with a few new things mixed in. Season Passes should ATLEAST come with a Strike, Crucible Map and a Gambit Map. Even that is such a bare minimum but instead we get to grind Bounties which is definitely the type of grind I\\'ve been always looking for. The \"new content\" is either just a new horde mode or gear that they recycled from Destiny 1 and if they add actual new gear that also looks cool, it almost always is something from the Eververse. Taking for example with Shadowkeep\\'s launch. We have the launch of a new raid: Garden of Salvation. A Garden Vex based raid that has us fighting our way through the mysterious black garden from D1. Within it we get a RESKINNED set of armour, a new exotic weapon quest, some kinetic and energy weapons and god fucking forbid why there is no heavy weapons is beyond me. A very below average loot pool I would say for a newly released expansion raid. However, there is no ship, no sparrow and no ghost within this raid. Except what should be considered the ship and sparrow for this raid is locked behind the premium tier of the season pass. And a Vex Harpy Ghost shell \"Harper\\'s Shell\" can be purchased from EVERVERSE. Why wasn\\'t any of this moved to help fill the absence of loot in a end game activity. Honestly there needs to be some kind of respect put towards these cosmetics Bungie. If you are designing something that is themed to a certain activity or season, don\\'t hide it behind a Eververse paywall and actually put it down as a earnable reward in activites. It shows that we have gone and earned them through either a loot drop in a end game activity or like you\\'ve done before, certain high tier triumphs so as they are not as rng loot dependant. Why not have the Thorn ornament as a reward for solo flawless, creates a sense of..........pride and accomplishment for doing so, rather then just an emblem. Before finishing this review I quickly just want to point out a few other things\\n-Surprisingly small Trials pool with the armor being yet another reskin.\\n-No ritual weapons.\\n-Quite a lot of hackers\\n-More error codes than you could humanly count\\n-Still no vendor refresh.\\n-This season is a bounty simulator, again.\\n-Strikes are STILL useless after YEARS of feedback.\\n-Another season without a raid with no word of how often we can expect them or even when we can expect the next one.\\n-Eververse seems to get the most attention. Looks like the only balance bungie really cares about is the one for my bank account.\\n-Just the general amount and quality of content is lacking.\\n\\nIt honestly feels like Destiny 2 has been in a slow decline since they parted ways with Activision, because at that time they got someone to put pressure on them to make actual content. Wether the content was good or not, it was still content and not hours of Bounty grinding, which doesn\\'t mean that I want them back because the Eververse is already bad enough.\\n\\nEdit: The new event \"Guardian Games\" is about deciding which Class is the best one, not by doing challenges that take skill and would be fun, but by boring bounty grinding. Bungie is really putting a hell lot of effort into these huh ?',\n",

       "  'review': \"Edit: This review was written before Witch Queen launched and was initially negative, I still stand behind most of what I said, without a DLC to hold your hand it will be rough as a new player.\\n\\nBut if you were on the fence, I can wholeheartedly recommend buying the Witch Queen DLC and jumping in right now. The campaign is absolutely amazing and is a perfect start for new players. It offers backstory/lore, a great villain, a challenge (on legendary) and an actually interesting story.\\n\\nBut most importantly, even if you don't buy the DLC, you no longer have to grind for 20+ hours to enter the Vault of Glass raid. You could try out some of the best content Destiny has to offer, straight away, although I would advise getting some gear first.\\n\\n\\n\\n- - - [h1]OLD REVIEW[/h1] - - - \\n\\n[h1]Become Legend[/h1]\\n\\n[h1]Preface[/h1]\\nAt the time of writing, I have spent 2437 (1580 + 857 orbit) hours in total on Destiny 2, since the Warmind expansion in 2018. There is only one other game I’ve spent more time on.\\n\\nThis game has given me some of the best gaming experiences I’ve had and probably will keep doing so: doing the campaigns with friends, my first underleveled nightfall as a kinderguardian (read new player), being carried through the first weekend of Whisper (thanks Java), farming EP for Ikelos-SG, my first raid (thanks Mortais), making friends, sherpa-ing others, participating and failing the day 1 LW, getting LH, getting the Rivensbane seal, going blind into the dungeons on day 1 with friends, solo flawlessing all dungeons, getting a week one completion in the CoS and GoS raid, lowmanning Levi/EoW/CoS, earning Not Forgotten and the Unbroken seal, scrims, going flawless, forming a proper team to stay up all night and get the day 1 completion for both DSC and VoG…\\n\\nWith that all said, how could I not recommend others to start playing and ‘become legend’ too? The game is great, gunplay/music/areas amazing, loot and community mostly good.\\nWhat’s not to like?\\n\\n[h1]The bad[/h1]\\nThe highest highs go paired with the lowest lows. Destiny 2 is hard to get into nowadays, don’t be fooled by the F2P tag, the ‘new light’ (read new player) experience is bad and doesn’t resemble the full experience in the slightest. \\n\\nThere are a lot of unexplained mechanics, everything can feel overwhelming at first, and then at some point you probably realize that there’s nothing left to do except grind strikes, crucible and gambit for the foreseeable future. Strikes turn stale fast, crucible is where new lights get extinguished and gambit is gambit. You might discover the Prophecy dungeon at some point, which might be a brick wall for some, but definitely fun for a couple clears. So what now?\\n\\n[strike]Wait, the F2P raid, the crème de la crème, Vault of Glass?! Well, first you have to grind all the way up from level 1100, to the soft-cap at 1270, grind powerful rewards for a couple weeks until you reach 1310-1320. All in all probably around 25-30 hours’ worth of doing the same activities over and over. This isn’t bad per se, but once you reach 1270 the grind slows down hard. As a new player back in 2018 I hated seeing my progression be time gated.\\n\\nWithout any dlc to hold your hand, this will be a rough and boring grind.[/strike] See edit, this no longer counts\\n\\n[h1]The worst[/h1]\\nSo you’ve made it through the entire grind, finished your first raid and are thinking about checking out the paid content.\\nWhile the money/spent-time ratio is pretty decent imo, and the campaigns can help guide new players in a fun way, do be prepared to spend quite some money and time.\\n[list]\\n    [*]Forsaken: 25€ -> Shattered Throne + Last Wish raid\\n    [*]Shadowkeep: 25€ -> Pit of Heresy + Garden of Salvation raid\\n    [*]Beyond Light: 40€ -> Deep Stone Crypt raid\\n[/list]\\t\\nWith upcoming:\\n[list]\\n    [*]Anniversary Dungeon: 25€\\n    [*]Witch Queen: 40€ OR Witch Queen + 4 seasons + 2 dungeons: 80€\\n[/list]\\t\\nIn total you’re looking at 80€ for the current content and another 100€ for upcoming. This alone can be a hard sell, so definitely don’t buy everything at once, maybe check out Forsaken or Beyond Light, try a single season, buy only Witch Queen on 22feb. \\nDo be warned though that content you paid for can and will disappear sometime in the future. The Forsaken campaign will leave in February. Previously we’ve lost 3 campaigns, 2 dungeons and 5 raids.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\\nI love the game and will keep playing it for the time being. But I can’t recommend it to new players, because it’s a mess.\\n\\nAs a new light you’ll need someone to hold your hand and even then it’ll be rough. I’d tell you it’s worth it in the end, but odds are against you, I’ve had way more friends give up on Destiny than get into it, currently sitting at 9 to 1.\\nIf you do decide to go for it, good luck, welcome to the community, join a clan, enjoy your firsts.\",\n",

       "  'review': '(Bungie fell from grace and added a shitty Battle Pass and have upped their microtransaction-game.)\\n\\nIf I were to describe Destiny 2 in a single sentence it would be: repeat infinitely, achieve nothing.\\n\\nDestiny 2 will never allow you to feel powerful. No matter how much you play, you will always be as strong as everyone else. No matter how long you spend grinding bounties, how many raids you do and how many dungeons you do you will never feel like you achieved anything. Every gun, every piece of armor is so similar, the biggest difference between them is how they look. And to make matters worse, shotguns, snipers and other more powerful guns have so little ammo, that there\\'s no point in using them. It\\'s usually quicker to just kill the enemies with your main gun than to swap and take 5 shots with a somewhat better gun.\\n\\nFor the same reasons you can only equip a single piece of exotic armor and  a single exotic weapon at once. It\\'s not because they\\'re any good, but it\\'s because if you could actually equip some of those cool pieces of gear you spent a hundred hours getting you would feel like you achieved something. Exotic powers range from making you run a little faster, to throwing grenades a bit farther, to giving energy to people around you wearing the same exotic. On their own, they\\'re so weak, almost none of them are worth using. It\\'s the same with guns. Some of them are actually good, but you can only equip one, so why bother grinding for more of them? Why bother doing the missions and challenges you paid for when they only give you a good gun you will never use? So few of the exotics are worth using, there\\'s no point in grinding for them. (Most of them are random drops, so you can\\'t actually even grind for them).\\n\\nDestiny 2 is a game for people who loves doing the same thing over and over again. \"Kill 10 Vex\" \"Kill 10 Vex on Mars\" \"Kill 10 Cabal on Nessus\" \"Go stand over there for a bit\" \"Do that dungeon again 3 times, but with harder enemies\". None of the missions give you anything good, anyways. Some glimmer and XP, and sometimes a gun or armor you will use for 5 minutes until you get one with a higher Power Level. It\\'s a waste of time. \\n\\nGo play Borderlands 3 instead. It actually lets you feel a bit of the power and fun you grind for, and weapons are actually unique.',\n",

To me, UT is the greatest, and I played every iteration since then. However, lately I think Epic (UT developer) have gone for kid-friendly stuff with Fortnite to milk them and lost hardcore people like me in the process. In comes APEX LEGENDS. \\nThis is the sci-fi themed Battle Royale that I have been looking for. Excellent fight dynamics, very good character differentiation,  good (but few) maps, great ping system and teamplay. I am married with children and still try to play a few games every night since I found this gem. And best part, it is FREE!! You should definitely give it a try.',\n",

You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.\\n\\n10/10. Def recommend\",\n",

       "  'review': \"You open the game and finish your 3000 word essay that's due tomorrow while it loads you into the main menu. You pray they fed the server hamsters today as you queue for a game. You pick Octane cause you like running around fast, not cause he's on drugs. Your teammates pick Caustic and Wraith. It's another TTV Wraith. The champion squad is a pred and 2 master players. The game begins and your caustic spends all game on his own trapping buildings, while you run around juiced up looking for loot and killing anyone in your way. You get jumped by a squad because footstep audio doesn't exist and you couldn't hear them coming. TTV Wraith goes down. You clutch a 1v3 because mastiff is balanced. Meanwhile, your Caustic is setting up traps outside the zone. You collect your Wraith's banner and try to respawn them but they leave with 0.2s left on the timer. You're in awe that this one stayed that long. Someone sees you next to the respawn beacon and kills you. They then immediately get 3rd partied while a far off 4th squad member misses all his kraber shots on them. The predator player shows up out of nowhere and wipes everyone in one sweep, dropping another 4k 20 bomb in the process. Your caustic dies to zone. You're back in the main menu and a random level 500 is waiting there for you in your party. They complain about not having heirlooms despite playing since season 1 but the dude that started last week has 2. You queue for another game. You get disconnected because two server hamsters passed out from hunger. Code: leaf. You wait to load back into the main menu and queue once more, cause you know it's worth going through it all again just to take another glance at Loba's thick ass.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Apex was a truly amazing game. It helped me have an outlet, as well as something to play with my best friend. I had so much fun with it, I made the questionable financial decision to invest into the game for awesome weapon and legend skins. After 510 hours, and a decent financial commitment and interest, I wasn't able to play as things where getting busy with work. In that time frame, my EA account was hacked by someone (Not Steam, but EA. The thing I'm not using to play). I'm unsure of what that person did, but whatever it was, was enough for me to be banned for violating user agreement. Despite the EA support seeing the suspicious login activity, and acknowledging my account being hacked, they still decided to stand by the ban. So here I am, 510 hours in, and unless I want to spend 5 months going through legal issues, this is the end of Apex for me. I'm sure someone reading this would say I could just create another EA account, but why would I invest any more of my time into a game, where the very people who are supposed to support you when something happens, are punishing you for it. EA will not get a single dollar from me ever again, and I will pass the message anywhere I can, Overall, don't buy this game, and certainly don't spend any money on it, 'cause it could be gone in an instant.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"out of all the BRs i've played extensively (PUBG, Warzone, Apex, Danger Zone, Fortnite) this is the one that i actually continue to enjoy.  Warzone is way too sweaty, PUBG's the engine lag is too unforgivable, Fortnite is too goofy, and Danger Zone has too little to offer.\\n\\nThe movement mechanics in Apex are super fun and you can take the game as casually or as seriously as you want and the community is fairly decent regardless.\\n\\nThe legends are quite varied but not overly oppressive and the skill is mostly around movement and gun mechanics that is mostly the same for all characters meaning you don't feel locked out of your style of game play the way games like Overwatch can.  And that skill ceiling is insanely high, developers are constantly adding content again, and games queue up very quickly so it doesn't get boring.\\n\\nif you tried Apex when it first came out and then left you should give it another shot - i did the same and was surprised how much richer and fun the experience is in 2021 when i came back for the end of Season 7.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Respawn's gunplay and movement are simply unmatched. No other game on the market except for maybe Call of Duty has guns that sound, feel, and look as good as the guns in Apex. It simply feels really nice to shoot things in Apex. It's truly the best of what the FPS genre has to offer. However, here's a big and stinky but: EA. These two letters, when put next to each other, strike fear into the hearts of five generations of gamers. The game is currently riddled with bugs, hackers, a scan-dominated meta, stale game modes, piss-poor matchmaking, and more. What does EA make respawn focus on instead? Pumping out more skins and collection events. This season is the most egregious one so far in this regard, with recolored skins littering the shop and events. Meanwhile, Mobile has 3 more legends than us, a highly - and I mean HIGHLY - requested team deathmatch mode, and tons of other cool features that the console/PC versions can only have wet dreams about. Thank you EA. You truly have the reverse Midas touch, where everything you touch turns into piles of doodoo.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] ♦️ Apex Legends [/h1]\\n[b] Apex Legends [/b] is one of the best ‘feeling’ fps games on the market, everything is tight from the looting, to movement, the gunplay, and so much more. Being one of the few games standing after the battle royal craze, [b] Apex Legends [/b] proves it is here to stay.\\n\\n[h1] Monetization [/h1]\\n→ Like most F2P games nowadays you should expect a real money cash shop. And for some skins in Apex you should expect to deal a pretty penny. Along with the typical battle pass, there is always something to try and catch your next paycheck. There are a fair bit of cosmetics to earn for no money spent, albeit with a large grind attached. Most weapon cosmetics are beautifully detailed, along with a ton of variety in customizing your own unique playercard.\\n\\n[h1] Gunplay [/h1]\\n→ Gunplay in Apex Legends is near perfect for any FPS game period. With 24 weapons available to choose from, each feeling as great to use as the last. Every gun in Apex is deadly if wielded correctly, this is because each gun feels skillful and is a joy to shoot. There is just a feeling of having the shooting in this game just ‘click’, and once it does you’ll never look at another FPS the same. The variety of recoil patterns, enjoyable to master bullet drop, etc. all combine to provide the core of Apex’s masterfully crafted gunplay. When you lose a fight in this game it doesn’t feel cheap, it feels warranted you know the mistakes you made. If there is one word to describe the feeling of gunplay in Apex Legends it is skill.\\n\\n→ One major facet of gameplay to note, is that Apex Legends offer a respawning option for fallen teammates. This means that no team is out of contention unless completely wiped, as one person surviving a tough fight could lead to an impressive comeback. This is another beloved feature of mine that worked its way into Apex. As the worst part of any battle royal is dying and having to watch your teammate sneak his way into the top 5 for 20 minutes. \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992578590\\n[h1] Game Modes[/h1]\\n→ Apex offers trios and duos for unranked and duos ranked. It also has skill based matchmaking so you should encounter more players around similar skill levels to yours. Besides that, Apex tends to have a lot of variety in adding limited time modes to change up the pace. Ranging from solos, to snipers & shotgun, and many holiday themed events.\\n\\n[h1] Movement [/h1]\\n→ Arguably one of the most popular aspects of Apex Legends is its movement system, and how fluid it feels to traverse the map. Mastering the gunplay is only one half of the battle, the best players are able to zip through the map in tandem with near perfect aim. The default sprinting being relatively quick to begin with, with sliding down slopes to gain momentum, being able to climb walls for a couple seconds, are the basis of the movement system. Using all these aspects together have you looking at that boring street with a couple buildings and instead seeing a jungle gym of speed. Just line in the gunplay, after hours of experience it just ‘clicks’ and traversing the map turns into a sort of dance. \\n\\n[h1] Looting [/h1]\\n→ A battle royal is only as good as the loot it provides, and Apex legends is no exception to this rule. Like I said with 24 weapons to find, countless grenade types, attachments, med/shields there is useful gear to be found around every corner. As stated above, every weapon is capable in the right hands so finding a ‘bad’ starting weapon isn’t the death sentence it can be in other games of the genre. The first couple minutes of a hot drop, is almost like a randomized deathmatch: Where the best team that utilizes abilities, teamwork, and aim to reign supreme. \\n\\n→ Not only are you searching for your favorite loadout throughout the match, you are trying to find attachments to enhance your gun. Now, previously I never really liked finding attachments in battle royals. But in Apex Legends finding the lowest quality attachments still feels rewarding and noticeable to use. So, it really lengthens the looting process instead of finding your complete loadout 5 minutes into the 30 minute match. Which might sound bad on paper, but in action it works extremely well. Almost eliminating the down time of teams camping buildings, and instead encourages constant looting extending into the late game.\\n\\n→ There are also tons of grendes to find that offer that edge to turn that 2v3 fight slightly to your favor. In other battle royals grenades almost feel like a party trick, a real shot in the dark. But in Apex Legends using the wide variety of grande effects is top priority to ensure survival. From smoke grenades, to firewalls, sticky, explosive there is a lot to play around with. So managing your inventory with a healthy supply of ammo and the right amount of grenades is crucial. Then adding in the different types of armor and meds to carry, leads to inventory management being a key skill as well. \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992381162\\n[h1] Roster [/h1]\\n→ With this newest release of season 7 there are now 15 playable champions to choose from. Each offering a completely different playstyle, all with their unique advantages and disadvantages. It is refreshing to see that no two champions seem alike, which makes finding the perfect champion for you a treat. From Pathfinder’s grapple hook to help swing across maps, Wattson’s ability to anchor down tight corridors, Crypto’s drone for intel, and that's not even scratching the surface. Each champion offers a unique passive, tactical ability, and ultimate allowing for impressive synergy with teamwork.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1992381274\\n[h1] Map Design [/h1]\\n→ There are two maps currently in Apex, Kings Canyon and World’s Edge: With the new map Olympus being released today! While they are by no means spectacular, they do serve their purpose and provide great scenarios for encounters to take place. Both are filled with key landmarks, that have you reminiscing of battles old and new. There is a real focal point on elevation in Apex Legends, which has you keeping in mind of possible locations of enemies at all times. If there is one thing to take away from Apex Legends map design, is to always have the high ground.\\n\\n[h1] Visuals & Sound [/h1]\\n→ Despite Apex Legends stealth drop back in 2019, the visuals still hold up today with other games in the genre. Apex Legends has a futuristic look with a little unique twist from Respawns doing. At first glance the visual style might seem generic, but soon you will see all the original love poured into Apex’s unique art direction. Running this game with max settings at 1440p is a real treat even in 2020 standards. \\n\\n→ The sound quality of Apex is also on par with its visuals, each gun has a distinct sound allowing you to easily tell what you’re up against. From the Kraber to RE-45 each gun has a satisfying [b] boom [/b]. The real win in the sound design, is the top notch directional sound. In other games you find yourself locking in on sounds holding a corner, only to be fooled by him coming from the opposite end. Whether you’re in a building, 200m away, or right under them the ability to locate enemies by sound in Apex is unmatched.\\n\\n[h1] ♦️ Conclusion [/h1]\\nApex Legends is hands down one of the best battle royal experiences provided today. There are many advanced systems in play that all combine in orchestration to make for the wonderfully unique experience that is Apex Legends. Please do yourself a favor if you like BRs, tight gunplay, and titanfall style movement this might be your new bread and butter. Apex Legends is an [b] Auto [/b] play especially considering the barrier of entry, that is being free to play. \\n[h3] Overall Score 9/10 [/h3]\\n\\n[quote]Visit SaveOrQuit.com for detailed game reviews, posted daily![/quote]\",\n",

       "  'review': '[b][u]Game-play :[/u][/b] \\n\\n- Its awesome if you have a good PC with decent graphics card installed otherwise god can help.\\n- Characters are great and I like their voices. :D.\\n- Best when you communicate and play with friends otherwise randoms will either make you mad or make you hero. \\n- You will find less people who actually talks if u are random.\\n- You will feel great when you actually win which is like <5% of your total game-play.\\n- Various game modes are there where you can switch which will make you busy.\\n- If you play regularly you will find various new events, which if you play will surely give you various in-game items guaranteed.\\n\\n[b][u]Cost :[/u][/b] \\n- If you are rich just buy the related character and get going.\\n- If you are fond of skins you either need to buy coins or wait and grind and wait for the skins to pop-up from apex packs.\\n- There are new events and characters which get released at every quarter, which you need to but for 950 coins, which either you need to buy or grind.\\n\\n[b][u]Issues Faced :[/u][/b]\\n-Whenever there is any big update, there are lots of server issues specifically in Singapore ones which I play.\\n- There are also many bugs which comes up sometime like not able to connect to server, server crashes, visibility issues in games ans so on which are many times known or either random.\\n- Also, apart from the anti cheat, there are also hackers which are difficult sometimes but surely are there.\\n- And last but not the least, ranking system is a joke. I find player on level 3-4 destroying player who are in level 200 or so, hence that I think need to be fixed as there are lots of smurfs and throwers in games who sometime just sit idle in game and ultimately we loose.\\n\\n[b][u]General Comment and recommendations :[/u][/b] \\n- Apart from all the issues and experience I have, I have to say its a very good competitive game and I surely get lost inside while playing which is worth. So a big thumps up for that.\\n\\n\\nAnyways thanks for reading my review, I am still playing it and love it everyday. Cheers!!!',\n",

       "  'review': 'Easily one of the best games ruined by bad management and run by a very greedy, short sighted publisher.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Excellent Movement.\\n- Satisfying gun play. Huge variety of guns of all types - Shotguns, SMGs, Pistols, Snipers, ARs. And they all are very good.\\n- Map sizes are excellent, not too big and empty and not too small either. Games are quick and no down time in the middle portion.\\n - New legends and weapons added every season.\\n- Maps are changed/updated every season keeping things fresh.\\n- Seasons are 3 months long offering plenty of time to complete battle pass.\\n- Completing a battle pass gives you enough coins to purchase the following season\\'s battle pass (you only need to buy once if you wanted).\\n- Also recently started offering more free rewards with mid season events etc.\\n- You also get lots of free packs, just for playing and levelling your account.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Easily the worst servers in any of the major Multiplayer games out there ( 20 tick servers ! PUBG has 60 and Valorant has 128 tick servers !)\\n- Almost non-existent anti-cheat. (Some regions are unplayable because there are so many cheaters. Even worse they have barely done anything to fix this issue in years. They literally have one guy manually reviewing clips and banning people ! )\\n- Cosmetics are overpriced. One legendary Skin for a gun or legend will cost you $18.\\n- In Game audio is very broken, you can have entire teams land on you and not make a sound. Audio seems to be in a queue of some sort. You may be busy fighting one team and as soon as you are done you will notice another team in your face that you did not hear coming.\\n- Communication is terrible from the studio in general. All you hear is \"we are working on it\" etc.\\n- Also unnecessary drama as some of the devs seem to get involved with the community via twitter, resulting in arguments and other nonsense which is not needed, including trolling players via patch notes or tweets.\\n- Updates almost always cause issues for at least a few hours. Game becomes unplayable or you can\\'t even get into a game.\\n\\n- SBMM (Skill Based Match Making) or more accurately EOMM (Engagement Optimised Match Making) : When you log in to play your first game of the day you will be given an easier lobby to make you feel really good at the game. You will get plenty of kills and maybe even win the game. This gives you a good boost and you will keep playing. You will then be matched with harder and harder opponents and you will constantly die. You will also be matched with team mates of much lower skill than yours and much higher skilled enemies. On top of this you will also be matched with pre-made squads while you are playing solo with randoms (this is something they said early on that randoms will not be matched with pre-made teams). Eventually after you have been losing constantly and getting destroyed by better players you will once again be given an easier lobby just to not put you off completely and that you return again to keep playing. This system is designed to keep you playing the game ! There is no sense of fairness in the matchmaking. People are not matched on skill but based on the fact that you might stop playing. This was added or tweaked somewhere in Season 3  and been noticeable since. The devs as you can expect deny its existence (EOMM), while many people including myself have done tests to check this out.\\n\\nThe main reason why I can\\'t recommend this game to new players is because I don\\'t see things changing or improving. After waiting patiently for seasons I have realised they are good at stringing you along making false promises while slowly sneaking in more and more greedy tactics to squeeze more money out of you. Of course its optional and you don\\'t have to spend anything but the money invested is not going into improving the user experience.

       "  'review': 'Apex Legends was the first Battle Royale game I put more than 1 hour into. Normally I don\\'t play these types of games - they\\'re just not something I personally enjoy all too much, but Apex Legends was different since a lot of my friends are [i]really[/i] into this game so I was able to semi-consistently have someone to play with which is amazing. Putting in almost 20 hours, I feel confident enough to say I\\'ve formed an opinion about it, so this review is just that.\\n\\n[h1]Do I think Apex Legends is good?[/h1]\\nHonestly...yes. I do. I didn\\'t expect it but I\\'ve been so far enjoying Apex Legends quite a bit. There are gripes I have with the game, but overall if someone asked me whether they should give this game a shot or not - my answer would be a solid yes. If that\\'s enough to convince you - good, hope you go on to enjoy the game. For the rest who want to hear more - read on.\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nThere are a lot of aspects about Apex Legends that I enjoy when talking about gameplay. So let\\'s break them down point by point.\\n\\n- [b]Gun play[/b]\\nThe guns in Apex are [i]satisfying[/i] to use. Most of them have really controllable recoil and the way they sound is just incredibly satisfying. If I had to compare it to anything, oddly enough I\\'d choose to compare it to TF2 - the gun play is rock-solid and seeing a really solid 60 damage, for example, is enough to give you that dopamine kick that lets you say \"hey I died but I had fun\".\\nNot everything is perfect though - one of my least favorite mechanics in any first-person shooter is bullet drop-off and Apex has that. I can understand why - for the sake of balance so that someone with an SMG can\\'t just snipe across the map, but even at mid-range it just feels clunky and annoying.\\nOn top of that some guns just feel kind of pointless. Prime examples for me would be most Energy Weapons and most Shotguns - their fire rate is usually abysmal and and take more precision to use. While this would be good in a tactical shooter in Counter-Strike or something, in a fast-paced battle-royale like Apex I just don\\'t think they work very well and they aren\\'t anywhere near as appealing as a Sniper Rifle or an LMG. I now understand why there\\'s memes about shotguns in this game being bad - it\\'s because they just really don\\'t fit in with the way this game wants you to play it.\\nTo clarify - I\\'m not saying they\\'re useless, I\\'m just saying that other options will get you results faster & more efficiently.\\n\\n- [b]Abilities[/b]\\nThis game\\'s abilities to a newcomer like myself are really daunting and I feel like they aren\\'t integrated into gameplay properly. It\\'s the one thing that I dislike about this game being that  you have no idea what you\\'re getting yourself into or what you are able to do as a new legend, making me instead play an entire game without using my ability once.\\nBut perhaps that could be seen as a good thing, as abilities are meant to be a situational thing you can use once in a while to either escape a sticky situation or get an edge on your opponent. But this left me feeling like some legends are more useful than others. Most of the time I end up playing Bloodhound & Lifeline because they\\'re conceptually super simple and easy to grasp, whereas characters like Wraith are difficult to understand when their abilities are applicable or not.\\nOverall though, I appreciate that this game doesn\\'t make it so you [i]need[/i] to use abilities to win but instead treats them as something you [i]can[/i] use if you need it.\\n\\n- [b]Movement[/b]\\nI love this game\\'s movement mechanics. Being based on the Source engine of all things it\\'s no wonder this game has really satisfying movement mechanics. Moving around, flying off of a jump tower or just sliding down a slope feels [i]really good[/i] and during fights - movement can either be the make or break of an encounter.\\nThe only complaint in regards to movement I have concern a specific legend - Pathfinder & his standard grapple ability. Depth perception will be your worst enemy and you will be constantly fighting with the game on what is considered the appropriate distance away to initiate a grapple. Once you get the hang of it it\\'s super satisfying but [i]man[/i] does it feel awkward initially.\\n\\n[h1]Monetization:[/h1]\\nThis is a free-to-play game, it\\'s natural that it has some monetization in it so that the developers can earn money from the product they\\'ve created. The one thing that has me pretty skeptical about this game is its publisher - EA - the worst possible one. Given this fact, how\\'s the monetization in this game? Honestly I\\'m incredibly mixed on it. Lemme go into detail why.\\n\\n- [b]DLC[/b]\\nThe DLC is stupidly overpriced for what it offers & the Steam reviews reflect that. $30 to unlock every single hero is honestly a stupid price & the other DLC definitely barely offer anything worthwhile to the consumer. Honestly I\\'m hardly surprised that this is a thing given the publisher but it\\'s just a shame altogether - I\\'d personally avoid the DLC if I were you unless it goes on a 50+% off sale at some point, if ever.\\n\\n- [b]Lootboxes[/b]\\nI think the lootbox system in Apex is pretty okay. I\\'m not condoning them being in here but their inclusion in this game is inoffensive at best. Apex Legends lootboxes offer 100% cosmetic items only of varying rarity with items ranging from crafting materials to use in the shop to weapon/character skins. From what I\\'ve gathered they don\\'t do limited-time lootbox drops so they\\'re avoiding making the consumer feel FOMO which is a welcome addition. In other words they\\'re there if you want them but you can absolutely skip them if you do not with to engage with them at all and I really appreciate that.\\n\\n- [b]Battle Pass[/b]\\nThis is one thing I actively dislike about this game\\'s monetization system, purely because it just clickbaits you constantly with stuff like \"Reach Level 25 to unlock this skin\", only for you to reach Level 25 and the game tells you \"buy premium to get this skin!\", at which point I just wanna tell the game to fuck off. The battle pass challenges themselves are fine but the rewards are underwhelming and the game keeps trying to drag you into buying the premium Battle Pass & I actively dislike that.\\n\\n[h1]Graphics, Sound & Optimization:[/h1]\\nHow are the other aspects of the game?\\n\\n- [b]Graphics[/b]\\nFor being developed on the Source engine it surprises me how much they were able to accomplish using it. The game looks great. Not outstanding or stunning, but still visually appealing and eye-catching.\\nSome gripes would be that the game tends to struggle with loading graphics on time so often I found myself staring at insanely low res textures, only for them to slowly fade into the higher quality ones. It\\'s not that big of a deal as it usually happened either during a loading screen or the character selection screen but still something I noticed regardless.\\n\\n- [b]Sound[/b]\\nThe sound & music of Apex is good. The guns sound great & the hitsounds are perfectly satisfying.\\nThe music isn\\'t anything outstanding - nothing that sticks in my mind so I don\\'t really have much to comment. Great to have in the background during non-crucial situations but definitely something you can freely mute & forget about.\\nThe voice acting is okay. Does the job & the actors do a good job portraying the character they need to.\\n\\n- [b]Optimization[/b]\\nI think the game could use some work in this department. I frequently notice random frame drops & also mentioned the texture-loading thing, but as a whole - the game doesn\\'t seem to struggle maintaining a playable framerate, it\\'s just that it likes to dip every so often and it is annoying.\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\nThere are more things I wanna talk about but I have to cut it due to the Steam character limit. Overall, Apex Legends surprised me being that it\\'s satisfyingly fun, looks great but the monetization system & optimization could use some work. If you were on the fence about trying it - you should try it and see if you like it.',\n",

       "  'review': 'With over 900+ hours on apex on origin and 400+ hours on steam, I can confidently say that I wouldn\\'t recommend this game to newer players. With the amount of smurfs, highly skilled players posing as level 2 wraiths, running around in low level lobbies this game is not friendly to the casual newbies. Even as a prestige level 112, theres nothing more sad than seeing a level 25 pathfinder mow you down with hipfire hemlock shots from an angle that even a predator would cry at. Now I know most of you will say \"thats just a skill issue\" but when its in every single match, it gets quite annoying. Another issue is apex\\'s skill based match making, the concept is simple, you get in matches with people who play on the same skill level as you. However, apex just throws players into matches as quickly as possible without regards to skill level.\\nI hope this review is helpful.\\nsincerely, a concerned player.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] The Best Battle Royale on the Market with some Faults [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n+ Smoothest Movement\\n+ Satisfying gunplay\\n+ Every animation & sound effect is so distinct, you can tell where and what is coming towards you.\\n+ Stressful but rewarding final circles in Ranked\\n+ Crossplay with friends on consoles (Nintendo Switch players are free kills)\\n+ Easy to complete battle pass within a month of playtime.\\n+ Beautiful maps such as Olympus & Stormpoint to the sweaty competitive maps, World's Edge & King's Canyon.\\n\\n[b] Neutral: [/b]\\n- Shares the same universe as Titanfall but the lore is okayish.\\n- I honestly think Apex has the worst cosmetic team next to Halo Infinite. Some of them are really just nice but exclusive to the battle pass or collection events. If you do find a really good skin that isn't a recolor of the default model, be ready to shell out 18/35/50 dollars up to 160+. It's honestly a cycle with this game, you get 3 seasons of good skins and 3 seasons of mediocre or trash skins.\\n- Pro games have teams compete against full mouse & keyboard vs full controller or a mix of both inputs in an endless battle that blends so well together.\\n- If you don't like the battle royale mode, there is a lite economy round based 3v3 mode to mess around in called Arenas.\\n- Limited time game modes like Control (Domination if you ever played COD) should be in the base game.\\n- Like every modern game today, the matchmaking system pits you against or with pro players, new players, or the average 2 hour free time guy.\\n- Since the game is free to play, there's lootboxes, completely random. Some get Heirlooms Shards (0.2% chance of dropping) early on, while it took me 800 hours. Heirloom Shards are for melee weapons or prestige Legends skins that do not affect gameplay. There is a bunch of crap in the lootboxes to further your chances of not getting what you want.\\n- Characters aside from the default roster need to be bought with in game currency or real money. They also cannot be tested in the firing range.\\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n- Somehow there's a game breaking bug every season.\\n- Squads/Quads (teams of 4) doesn't exist, leaving that one friend all alone while the rest play Trios. Nor is there a true solos mode.\\n- Servers are really bad causing desyc/bullets aren't registering, crashing, or disconnects.\\n- Enemy footsteps sometimes doesn't work.\\n- Joke of an esport; the recent ALGS 2022 had players dc, visas denied, teams teleporting across the map and dying to their deaths, or players gettings covid - forcing teams to play as a duo instead as a trio. The tournament organizers didn't want to restart despite all these problems. Also they didn't even play on LAN?? The event was connected to the nearest server. Even the custom matches for pros to scrim in, didn't work for a while.\\n- The balancing or design team whatever you want to call them is very questionable. You have 2 Legends, Seer & Valkyrie dominating tournaments without a single nerf in sight meanwhile, Lifeline's old shield passive was reworked into a new Legend, we have two of the same character now. Which leads onto my next point, a few characters share the same ability just slightly different. Sooner or later the game will become a massive unbalancing mess than it already is. Then finally, some Legends that need a buff stay untouched for a very long time.\\n- Easy anti-cheat would sometimes blue screen my computer or crash my game back to the desktop once in a blue moon. \\n- The lack of a spectating system without going into match or a dedicated match history.\\n\\n[h1] Recommended Youtube / Twitch Content [/h1]\\n\\n[b] Pro Mouse and Keyboard [/b]\\n- ImperialHal, Reps, Albralelie, HisWattson, Apryze, Sweetdreams, Hardecki, Nafen, Taisheen, Mande, sYnceD, Monsoon, Rogue\\n\\n[b] Movement Gods [/b]\\n- Aceu, Stormen, Taxi2g, Faide, Crylix\\n\\n[b] Pro Controller Demons [/b]\\n- ChaoticMuch, Verhulst, Daltoosh, Staynaughty, Knoqd, Pandxrz, Snip3down, Thekine\\n\\n[b] Casual / Funny [/b]\\n- Rag Tagg, Lej, Emerald Gemerald & the butt load of vtubers on Apex\\n\\n[b] Informative [/b]\\n- TheGamingMerchant, Mokeysniper, & ottr\\n\\n[b] Fan Animations [/b]\\n- Cheetah, Tooncraft, Hoxdolum, & dopatwo\",\n",

       "  'review': \"As someone who has played the RU version for 1000hrs+ and have leveled two characters legit and boosted 8 of them (to 50) my two cents about the topic:\\n\\n+ The game is a fun journey from start to the endgame. The leveling process gets a bit dull, but on your first character it's manageable.\\n\\n+ The start of the endgame is quite fun. When you first hit 50 there's a lot 'island quest' storylines to complete, reputation quests to unlock, new guardian fights/new dungeons/new raids to experience, some 'sea events' and other 'timed events' to check out. Progression feels pretty good and smooth (until you gear gets around +9, the +10-+15 upgrades are significantly 'harder' to succeed => More fails => More costs => Way slower progress).\\n\\n+ The equalized arena PvP is fun although very CC-heavy and takes a little learning curve to get into. However the rewards are quite poor beyond the 'weekly' ones, so unless you are really into PvP you probably won't spend a lot of time playing it. The ranked PvP is only TRUE SOLO QUEUE, so no premades (which is pretty fun for solo players!).\\n\\nWhat does this actually have to do with potential P2W and 'forced alts'?\\n\\n+ Kinda tricked you with the topic. The game is a fun journey even before you need to think about spending.\\n\\nTo the actual topic:\\n\\n+ Once you hit your first progression wall (starting from +9 / +10 upgrading) you'll start to see yourself being handicapped by various resources. It might be materials (drops from limited daily dungeons/daily quests etc.), it might be shillings (daily dungeon/daily quests/'limited' cube dungeon), or it might be gold (weekly dungeons/weekly raids/weekly quests). To get through this wall you'll either need to just take it slow (log-in and do your daily/weekly things) or go faster (start making alts that allow you to farm more of the aforementioned) or go super fast (start top-upping with $/€'s and turn that into gold to get the resources needed for the upgrade gamble).\\n\\n+ 'Taking it slow' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character\\n\\n+ 'Going faster' is around 1-2 hours each day for your 1 character + 1-2 hours or so per WEEK per alt character\\n\\n+ 'Going super fast' is only limited by your bank account <- beware though getting to 'max gear' as soon as possible removes many gaming goals you might have when 'taking it slow' or 'going faster'\\n\\nNow there are other monetizations that boost your progression in various ways but these are laid out in other posts and are not that significant. Basically with 50$ you'll get all the permanent things you'll ever 'need' and then you have the option of running the recurring 'crystalline aura (sub)' for extra benefits. The only thing I'd raise as a 'must-have' is the pet which is around 5-10$ and it's ACCOUNT WIDE, so you'll only need one of them. The reason for the pet is auto-looting, which is a major convinience for your daily dungeon running (the pet picks up the constant loot pinata from the daily dungeons instead of having to run around furiously smackin the loot button). Pets are also given out through events so you are likely to get one for free sooner or later.\\n\\nTLDR; The game is a fun journey from 1-50 regardless of whether you spend a single dime or not. When you get to the mid-late game (of the current patch) you'll either take it slow (1 character), go faster (alts) or you go super fast (spending $/€'s).\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I know what you\\'re thinking, \"Dude, you played the game for almost 2000 hours, how can you not recommend the game?!\" Well, that\\'s the funny thing about this game. You don\\'t really realize what you\\'re getting into until you reach the true endgame. I\\'ll try to be brief and precise about the important issues. \\n\\nFirst off, the game is fundamentally pretty damn fun. The combat is fun and the visuals range from pretty good to gorgeous. There are plenty of systems that are kind of annoying and there\\'s certainly lots of rng and things to grind at in the game, sometimes frustratingly so. But where I really hit a wall and felt my will to continue completely fade away was the endgame upgrade system. This is where most people realize just how pay-to-win the game is.\\n\\nI reached ilvl 1475 on my main with relative ease, all things considered. I was happy about that considering the extremely low success rates. But once you get into raiding and acquire some relic gear, this game becomes very punishing.. but not the good kind of punishing, the kind of punishing where you can almost hear the sound of laughter coming from somewhere. But, it isn\\'t coming from your friends, or other players, no, it\\'s coming from the devs. They\\'re laughing at you. \"Look at this loser\" you hear them say, \"he failed his 60% chance to upgrade his relic quality, and when he got it the second time, it only went up by 2%. HAHAHAHA, what an idiot\".\\n\\nNow I could clarify, but it would take forever. Just know that this is just one of many upgrade systems in the game, and it\\'s very expensive and very depressing. Plus the game wants you to do this for several pieces of gear across all your characters. Having multiple alts is also encouraged to help aid your main with materials and gold. Unless you completely whale this game and spend thousands of real dollars each month, you will struggle without alts. This makes the game quite repetitive after a while too. \\n\\nThe last thing I want to talk about is one of the many currencies in the game called Pheons. This straight up made me quit the game entirely. If they removed it, I might consider coming back. I remember saying to myself \"Instead of subjecting myself to this, how about I just don\\'t, quit, and live a happier life?\" So I did. I don\\'t think the devs realize how much this currency is destroying their player retention...\\n\\nBasically, Pheons are a currency that you need to purchase most things and ALL important things on the player market/auction house. They are VERY expensive to purchase outright in the store, and the devs give out insultingly low amounts on rare occasions. You need a lot of them, You will always need them as the game gets updated. Dealing with this currency made me feel like someone had their hands around my neck, squeezing just hard enough to keep me alive.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I didn\\'t like how this game made me feel anymore. I wasn\\'t having fun anymore. I\\'m sick of hearing laughter in the distance. I\\'d rather be happy. I\\'d rather spend my time on things in life that add value and joy and peace to my soul. This game just feels like I was dredging through an alleyway full of heroine addicts trying to get me to buy some and hang out with them. Fuck that.\\n\\nOh, and the game\\'s bot problem is severe and will probably never be fixed.\\n\\n*edit: Just wanted to add some more context to this. At review time, I hadn\\'t played for 3-4 months. I played a little bit more afterwards to check in on things, try out the new classes, and check out new skins. The economy appears to be getting worse though. Gold and prices on the auction house have more than doubled, Pheon\\'s are still in play, items are becoming more scarce, bots are still everywhere, and island instances are completely dead. I want to play this game, but It\\'s not worth it. As new games and MMO\\'s come out this year, I imagine more people will leave and move on. Thanks for reading.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I’m going to write this review in the hope that new players gets a basic understanding what they’re gonna get into. At the time of writing, I stopped playing the game almost 2 weeks ago. Today I logged in to take a snapshot of my character screen (like a souvenir) then I uninstalled. This is going to be a thumb-down from someone who have spent 2,000 hours in this game... yeah, I’m going to be *that* kind of person for once.\\n\\nLost Ark is a game that gives you a lot of thing to do but you’re not going to particularly enjoy it. If I have to give an honest opinion about how much I enjoyed Lost Ark in the 2k hours I’ve played, I’d say maybe 20% was fun while 80% was a waste of time. The game WANTS you to waste that time so that you get to the good part.\\n\\nReminder: I’m writing this for NEW PLAYERS. So, existing players who gonna read this and comment (I won’t disable comment, criticize within reason) just keep in mind that your/our experience from launch and the experience of someone new today is going to be a stark contrast.\\n\\nThe story is just your average MMORPG shtick. Very likely you’re going to stop paying attention at the poor English localization half hour in the game and you’ll start mashing your G key (thus the meme you might have seen already). You’re going to press G for the next 12 hours or so if you’re fast and you don’t get too sidetracked. Else you’re looking about 15 hours of G-spamming.\\n\\nThe story is not compelling, you get an occasional cool cutscenes which pretty much tells you everything you need to know then you are sent on your way to do the tedious of story question: Go to X, speak with this NPC, spend 1 minute to go to Y, Speak to this NPC, go back to X and speak with that NPC again, rinse and repeat ad-nauseam.\\n\\nYou do the above for 12 – 15 hours before you hit “Tier 1 gear” at which point you start shifting in what’s gonna be your daily routine for the rest of your Lost Ark career.\\n\\nThe progression from T1 to mid-T3 is going to be brutal for you. It’s a dead zone, YOUR dead zone. There’s only bots wherever you’re going and the content you can do barely has players to help you with. This is literally going to be a phase where you’re going to spend roughly the next 100 hours (realistically it’s going to be closer to 200 hours) to get in a decent spot in T3. “Decent spot” is an always moving target as the game gets new content and the playerbase keeps moving forward. How tedious it’s going to get there all comes down to how merciful (or in touch with the playerbase) the dev is feeling is feeling at that time.\\n\\nAs you settle in your daily routine, you’re gonna realize how much RNG is involved in various aspect of the game and how much of it purely waste your time in a way you’re not going to enjoy. Imagine an important item locked behind a collectible that have a low chance to drop three times every week. You might get it on your first try, you might end up getting it on your 20th week (it’s a thing: ask anyone about the “Moake” hell and how group of friends gets their item drop while others are still left behind after 3 months still killing the same boss).\\n\\nGold is going to be your most valuable currency but the one you farm is going to have trash value. Why? Bots. Oh that Schoolgirl skin you see people walking around in? You can get it in the cash shop for $40 OR you can spend 45,000 gold to purchase it in the auction house. What? You’re only making 3,000k gold week? Well, tough luck! Save for 15 weeks and hope that inflation, caused by the disgusting amount of bot, is not going to make the price rocket to 60k by the time you get your 45k. Oh, you can’t even save that gold because you actually need it to hone your weapon, armor, to purchase mats, to buy dungeon/raid chest, etc, etc. Guess you’re out of luck!\\n\\nBots are rampant. About 4 months ago, I thought bots were at the worse point (looking at the price of RMT) but oh boy how wrong I was. RMT price is currently half of the price of what I thought was the worse point 4 months ago. What does that mean? The current of the game in terms of botting/RMT is TWICE as worse as the time that I thought it was worse. Inflation is at an all time high.\\n\\nIf you still manage to push through all these barriers and somehow manage to get your character high enough for the end-game raid content then congrats! Also; tough luck. No one gonna take you in their raid. The game is such a huge time sink that there’s very few who are willing to spend the time to fail with you in a raid because you WILL fail and you HAVE to fail to learn but the likeliness of having 7 other people who are either happy to teach you or fail with you is so low that you’re going to be spending quite sometime in the party finder just to go nowhere.\\n\\nThis game was fun back when it launched. Having a huge group of actual people running beside you in-world was such a breath of fresh air. It was fun, everyone was learning, everyone was talking. The current new player experience is a dead zone that I don’t wish upon anyone. The end-game is brutal once you reach it not because of the content difficulty but mostly due to how you’re going to get filtered out. Everything in between is a huge waste of time aimed at squeezing play hours from the players.\\n\\n\"Lost Ark respect your time.\": So we were told, turns out it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\"Lost Ark is alt friendly.\": When the game foundation is built upon having multiple characters, this statement is far from the truth. There\\'s so much things to do to make this game alt friendly but dev outright refuse. One of the biggest offender is materials such as Shards which are character bound. If this was an alt friendly game, Shards would never be bound. Neither Guardian/Destruction/Leapstones would have been bound.\\n\\nLost Ark doesn\\'t respect your time and is possibly one of the worse case of botting I have ever seen in an online game.',\n",

I have a lot of hours, but I didn\\'t play the first couple of weeks when it was released and I still feel behind. Imagine just starting the game now.

Then after talking to three people I was able to get the ticket reopened. It has been another month and a half and still no reply from the devs other than they are \"looking in to it rest assured\".

One day I went to log in and found I was banned and the only information I had was a \"Code of Conduct\" violation. I submitted an appeal and after 4 days heard nothing back. I submitted another appeal and was informed that my account was commerce locked for refunding a founders pack and that the ban would not be lifted. I checked my purchase history to confirm because I didn\\'t remember refunding a founders pack and I have no refunds for Lost Ark. I appeal again and am told the matter is closed and no further responses from AGS CS are warranted. I look at the forums and find that people are being banned because they purchased skins on the in-game auction house from people that later refunded their founders packs. I was banned because someone else refunded an item after they sold it on the auction house because the skin I purchased and equipped is linked to an account that was banned. AGS is the worst gaming company I have ever worked with. They were horrible at managing New World and now they are completely botching Lost Ark.

       "  'review': '[b]If you are looking for a new job, Lost Ark is for you![/b]   Unlike a normal job where the employer pays you, Lost Ark gives you every opportunity to pay them instead.  Excited yet?  You\\'ll be expected to donate thousands of dollars AND hours of your life to this new job!  Wait, there\\'s more!   If you don\\'t, nobody will take you seriously enough to let you do the best end-game content.  That\\'s right, not only does this job demand your every waking moment and spare cash, you\\'ll also experience gate-keeping and toxicity on scales you\\'ve never before dreamt of!   Don\\'t wait, apply today!\\n\\nSnarky sarcasm aside...  This is a pay to win game.  That is, they do everything possible to make free to play as absolutely miserable as they can.  They want to get your cash, and everything about the game is geared for exactly that.   However, even if you pay you\\'ll find it\\'s never enough, unless you\\'ve spent thousands.   I\\'m serious, it\\'s beyond insanity. \\n\\nI have over 2k hours of play time in, and let me tell you:  it\\'s just a non-stop rat race of the same monotonous content.  You will have to do the same content so much and so often, if you make a mistake or aren\\'t over-geared for it, other players will  express their great displeasure at having to spend an extra 45 seconds of their life in that miserable place because YOU screwed up.   It\\'s a toxic community, made so by a toxic game system, which itself is framed around a toxic and predatory monetization engine.  \\n\\nThe only reason to play this game is for the Legion Raids, which is the only content that provides any actual challenge to players.   All the other content is just a grind-fest, some of which is mandatory to get your maximum amount of weekly gold, item currencies, and upgrade tokens that will ensure your further progression.   Speaking of progression, you have to advance at least 6 characters in this game, or you\\'ll never keep up the gold generation/farming needed to sustain end-game participation on just 1 character.  Which means you\\'ll have to spend a lot of time and resources on those extra characters too.   The grind-god is never satisfied.\\n\\nYou\\'ll be spending A LOT of time obtaining currencies, and spending A LOT of currency to progress these alts as well as your main characters to ensure you can get gold.   What is gold good for?   The Auction House.  Upgrade items and gear.  Perhaps more importantly, you can convert gold into Blue Crystals.   That part is important because Blue Cyrstals are the only way you can obtain Pheons.   \\n\\nWhat the heck are Pheons?   They are a required currency when buying gear and upgrades from the Auction House to wear on your characters.  The gear you wear is what determines your item level.  After you obtain the gear, the chance you\\'ll have to upgrade it will be very low - at the highest levels, less than 1% chance per upgrade attempt, with each attempt costing tens of thousands of gold in materials.  Your item level is what determines what raids and other content you can participate in.   So, Pheons and Blue Crystals are essentially a pay-to-win currency that severely stifles free-to-play progression.\\n\\nHow do you get Pheons?   You have to buy them from the in-game marketplace with blue crystals.   How do you get blue crystals?   By spending real cash, or sacrificing massive amounts of the gold you made that week to exchange said gold for blue crystals, just to exchange the crystals for pheons.   Every time you exchange one currency for another, the game taxes you through horrible conversion rates or artificially inflated pricing directly for cash.   \\n\\nOf course, many players elect to bypass months of grinding altogether by going to 3rd party gold sellers, who operate swarms of bots on every server.   These bots have one goal - farm gold.   Unfortunately, this has ruined the economy for anyone who doesn\\'t buy gold, and unforgivably, SmileGate / Amazon have been doing the bare minimum necessary to counter the issue.   It really seems to me they have zero ability to control their own in-game economy, and if you aren\\'t a long-time player of MMOs/RPGs let me just say that this is A MAJOR red flag.   Buying a solid piece of equipment from the auction house will often cost around 100 gold (which is nothing) but it will cost you 25+ pheons, which is worth about $10 USD.   \\n\\nYou see the problem yet?   Even if you had millions of gold, it\\'s not the gold that is worth anything - it\\'s their cash shop pheon and blue crystal currencies that hold real value.  [i]Also, throw away any thoughts of making millions of gold easily because the game caps you to less than 50k gold PER WEEK[/i], that is unless you sell your time (and have a grossly over-geared character) to bus lower level players through raid content they no longer have the patience or brain cells for doing themselves in normal groups.   Time, blue crystals, and pheons are the real currencies of this game.\\n\\nWhich is another point of contention - worthless currencies.  There are no less than 2 dozen currencies in this game, at the bare minimum.  Maybe as many as 60?  I\\'m not sure anyone has counted all of the tokens, coins, and other crap you need to collect to spend at vendors, but it\\'s just stupid.  Almost all of them are unnecessary. \\n\\nThere are so many negatives about this game, such as the card collection system, the tedious and monotonous \"I\\'d rather watch paint dry\" progression quests and the hellish time-sink of performing those 6 different times on alt characters, the toxic community that gate-keeps every raid or event you\\'ll try to participate in, and so much more.\\n\\nAvoid this game like the plague.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Went in with 0 expectation and sunk 20 hours in the Alpha. I didn\\'t want to burn myself out, but I also have no idea when the game is actually launching, so I took the Gunlance class to level 40. I think the game is fantastic, and am excited for launch.\\n\\nThe dungeons were interesting, though there are far too many mini cutscenes, where your characters all slowly climb a ladder, or walk across a skinny beam. The story is decent, but I found myself spam clicking through it after level 20 or so just to get back into the action. Being able to respec your talents for free was very nice, allowing me to try out different abilities with different modifiers as I progressed.\\n\\nPeople who are saying the game is too easy, it is because they give you weapon boxes that give you a very high item level weapon that you won\\'t replace anytime soon. This is made obvious, because completing the first dungeon on hard mode drops lower item level weapons than the one you get out of the gate at level 10. I think this is a good thing, because otherwise the level progression would be very slow/spongy enemies as a result. If you want an authentic experience or whatever, don\\'t use the boxes.\\n\\nPvP side: I met with a group of players dueling consistently through alpha. At the time, I was a level 30 Gunlance, and dueled an Artillerist level 28. Most of the players participating were level 15, with the rules \"No healing potions, no ultimates\" -Your Z and/or V abilities you generate over time-) Perhaps it\\'s my lack of knowledge on the game, but ranged classes have several abilities that stagger lock you. Artillerist has a flame thrower, and if you are caught anywhere in the massive cone, you can\\'t do anything. You just flinch and take the damage, and there are no diminishing returns that I saw. As a Warlord, my dodge ability is a unique back hop that I absolutely hated, giving me a small dodge that rarely took me out of danger. There are some abilities that give super armor, but for now I\\'ll leave it as \"I\\'m new to the game, and ranged classes kick my ass for the time being\".\\n\\nAddressing Pay 2 Win concerns: I don\\'t feel it\\'s a pay 2 win model traditionally, but I could see upcoming top guilds recruiting only players who have the platinum founders pack, rushing to 50, and spending the premium currency to load out their characters and rolling the map. That\\'s pure speculation, as I understand you can pay to upgrade your gear or do it in game over time. This could be pretty frustrating, but I don\\'t have any knowledge of what guild wars actually do for you, and it\\'s not my priority. There are several streamers who state that they play in other countries 100% free to play, and sell their stuff to people paying real money, perpetually allowing them all the bonuses without spending a dime. This is a good thing IMO.\\n\\nClasses. Class balance seems strange. There are 5 or so classes that won\\'t be released at launch that are available in other countries. We have access to 14, and some of the power house classes aren\\'t available (Scouter/Demolisher/Lance Master/Arcanist seem to be the most desired based off general chat). It feels like they are gating them so that players dump their time in a first character, and then pay to gear up the new classes when they release. I\\'m not a fan of games having content ready and slowly introducing them for cash grab, but 14 classes is still plenty to find something you like. Gender lock really isn\\'t\\' a major issue for me, outside of not wanting to have my character look like a waifu.\\n\\nSo to wrap it up, as someone who went in with 0 expectation, and 0 knowledge of the game, I really enjoyed it. I think the market is in serious need of a new MMO format, and this is a game I will gamble on.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I loved this game. The first part was a grind. Getting a character to lvl 50 felt like it took an eternity. But once I was able to join my friends on end game content, it was a blast. It all went to hell when I decided to start collecting mokoko seeds. One day I decided to sit at a breakable wall on Mount Zagoras and attack it to get the 3 hidden/ blocked collectibles. After about an hour and with the help of a random player, we got the seeds and then I got permanently banned for cheating. I went back and forth with Amazon Games customer service bots and they sent a final \"We can\\'t share any further information about our decision, and we won\\'t reply to further emails about the issue\". \\n\\n367 hours down the drain because I did exactly what the game developers designed when they made a wall/barrier that requires a ton of hits to break down. It is sad, but clearly they don\\'t care how much time is invested in their product. Maybe if I wasn\\'t F2P I would have had a different outcome.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I have been playing since launch and have since put 2.5k+ hours into this game. I have held out as long as I could in hopes that this game would get better because it has a lot of positive aspects – cool classes, great combat, and a wide variety of vertical and horizontal content.\\n\\nHowever, the game’s community is by FAR one of the worst I have experienced. To mirror some of the other reviews – people are incredibly toxic and gate-keeping is the worst I’ve seen in any MMORPG. Don’t have enough item level, engravings, or a specific title? You’re not getting into a party. If somehow you do make it into a group, be prepared to get chewed out if you make a mistake because many raids have a raid-wipe mechanic where all eight players need to be on the same page. Your average player has very little patience for wipes and will force a group quit after a few failures instead of communicating or trying to teach players how to do a raid mechanic properly. With that said, I have met a small number of helpful players in the 8.5 months playing the game but they are definitely in the minority.\\n\\nOther issues I’ve seen with the game that haven’t been addressed are the rampant bots and inflation. I can’t speak for all regions but on NA West, the server I play is on like 75% bots and it’s honestly disgusting to see how many of them are running around the capital cities. AGS/Smilegate claim they are doing everything they can to combat the bots but it’s obviously not working – you see items on the auction house being sold for millions of gold constantly which is obviously real money transactions happening. The price of items and blue crystals (premium currency you can buy with real money or gold, needed to buy gear and cash shop items) is skyrocketing to a point that is just laughable. The price for 100 blue crystals exceeds that of Korean servers now because of how insanely out of control the botting problem is on NA servers. A single earring can cost 300k+ gold which is absurd when an 8-man raid only gives 3-5k on a weekly lockout. Class engraving books have tripled in price the past few months – it will now take upwards of 400k gold to get 20 legendary class engraving books, depending on what your build is. As a new player, it will be extremely difficult to catch up without at least swiping your credit card a little bit. \\n\\nThe last issue I have is how prevalent RNG is in this game and maybe a non-issue for those that are accustomed to this type of game. I currently have every adventurer tome at 100% except Brelshaza for South Vern and almost every collectible at 100%, key word almost. The RNG aspect is so heavily ingrained into every aspect of the game that you could get royally screwed on certain drops for months/years if you are unlucky. For example, at time of writing this, I am still missing the Lush Reed island soul and Forpe Island sea bounty to name a couple, despite having run them every time available since launch in February 2022. Gear progression is all RNG based as well – the success rate for honing your gear to the next level drops to such a small amount (1-3%) that you could spend weeks of materials/gold just to increase one piece. \\n\\nTo a lot of players I’m sure these gripes are OK and no big deal but for me personally, this is incredibly demoralizing gameplay and feels like I am wasting so much time just to fail. I’m surprised I’ve invested as much time as I have and uninstalling the game honestly feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders. If you are looking to be rewarded for investing your time, look elsewhere. This is NOT a casual friendly game.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game itself is magnificent. Surely, it may have some mobile like feel and it does have some of the sins of F2P model, but if you play the game, you can instantly feel that it\\'s a product of love by the development team. Fights are mechanically challenging, graphics are stunning, contents are more than enough to keep you occupied and coming back for more.\\n\\nSo why the negative review? Simple. The game is published and serviced by one of the worst companies I\\'ve experienced through out my over 2 decades of gaming. Amazon Games Studio.\\n\\nThey have done injustice to the game since pre-launch. Butchered the original version in the name of \"Westernization\". To watch the original director actually complain about what they\\'ve done, changing names of characters and applying censorship changes, on an OFFICIAL interview was simply depressing.\\n\\nGame launches, guess what happens. Server overload and instability every single day. Maintenance, patching, more problems, more down time, rinse and repeat.\\n\\nEconomy already went to complete ruin because despite the numerous warnings against how rampant the game will be with RMT and botters without proper measures in place to deal with it preemptively. Out of 1M concurrent you see, literally 50% are suspected to be bots because according to steam accomplishment, less than 15% of players even reach the end of leveling tutorial, and how inflated the market is is simply ridiculous. When community kept warning AGS about how this will happen, they said \"they will be monitoring closely\". What a joke.\\n\\nSo they finally \"do something\", mass ban wave. They pay news outlets to publish articles that they\\'re banning 1 million bot accounts and they should be praised for working hard to keep the game clean.\\n\\nState of the game remains the same. Guess what though, thousands of players get caught up in false positive bans but they have no infrastructure to support the appeal process. Hell, they literally closed down call center couple weeks ago after Lost Ark\\'s explosive launch. People get stuck in endless loop of sending ticket and receiving macro response without even getting an answer on why they got banned.\\n\\nYou have people getting perma banned for refunding founders pack PRIOR TO GAME LAUNCH, in many cases, to upgrade to a more expensive packs.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for trying to break down barrier that takes 15 minutes to break while listening to music.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for buying skins in Auction House because seller of the skin refunded.\\nYou have people who getting perma banned for receiving mail attachments.\\n\\nWhat a complete and utter shitshow. What exacerbated the situation is that initially, Community Managers tried to gather information on the community forum to help the cases get reviewed.\\nThe next day, different CM closes down the topic.\\nNext day, these topics start getting deleted.\\n\\nLevel of unprofessionalism is simply incredible and the game really deserve better. \\nIn no other industry would this type of behavior and incompetence be tolerated. It\\'s a tragedy.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Let me preface this by saying this review's purpose isn’t so that I get unbanned, at this point I don’t plan to ever return and play any AGS games. This is the first time I’ve been banned on any online game and this is the point that really irks me. This is here to provide some awareness for anyone who may be interested in this game and hope that others who’ve been unfairly banned will speak out so at the very least others may be aware and AGS may actually start becoming better or competent. \\n\\nBackground:\\n•\\tOver 800 hours on the account.\\n•\\tMy characters and some relevant equipment are as follows (AFAIK, Gem levels may be all over the place, 1 or 2 level 7, most were 4 or 5, few 6), I don’t bus at all and I’ve only ridden on a couple busses mostly for new 1370s. Bought the Gold Pre-release founders pack on release:\\n•\\t1462.5 Paladin – 1x level 7 Gem, assorted other gems usually all under 5 as I just forged most of my gems for 2 x level 7 Gems before the ban; all legendary accessories 3/3/3/1/1\\n•\\t1430 Glaivier – level 4-6 Gems, relic accessories 4x3, 1x1\\n•\\t1415 Deathblade – level 4-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1\\n•\\t1415 Sorceress – level 4-5 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2\\n•\\t1415 Bard – level 3-4 Gems (new Powerpassed character), legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x2\\n•\\t1402.5 Gunslinger – level 3-6 Gems, legendary accessories, 3x3, 1x1 or 2\\n\\nSuspected Triggers for Ban:\\n•\\tI’ve been selling as much stuff as possible to try to get enough for Legendary Grudge Engraving. Recently, I merged all my Paladin Gems and got 2x level 7 Gems but both were damage Gems so I moved those to my DB to reforge and bought 1 level 7 CD gem for around 15k Gold I believe (NAE Market Price). The DB rerolled the 2x level 7 Gems and sold them for 16k list, 18k BO which both sold on the market. Also sold T3 Destruction Stones and Honing Stones.\\n•\\tBought a Swimsuit skin with RC and sold some of the pieces on the Market for Market price (pretty heavy fluctuation during the final weeks of the sale)\\n•\\tBought new skins for my Bard and Sorceress and replaced some of the older skins by selling on the market for market price.\\n\\nBan and Appeal Process:\\nI found out I was banned on Sunday at around 9 PM EST. Obviously, I could not tell what triggered my ban so I sent in an appeal request at Sunday at 9:16 PM.\\nI received a reply at 9:28 PM saying that my ban was permanent and the disciplinary action was merited but they did not state why I was banned apart from Cheating which still does not tell me anything. \\n\\nI sent a reply back stating I still do not know what I was accused of and I can’t provide evidence against something I do not know, noted that my characters were the ilevels above and their gems/accessories being not high value. I also noted that most of my characters had rested bonus so I probably wasn’t botting and asking for escalation and got this as automated reply saying I’ll hear back from them within 6 hours.\\n\\nAfter that I did not hear anything back. I re-sent in an appeal on Monday and it was becoming clear that they do not read these at all and just send the same prepared responses without any review. This went on constantly so at this point I’m pretty confident that they don’t ever read these and just block you. I read on their forums that sometimes the German one may actually result in an actual person reviewing the case but same response in German. I have sent in other appeals but all had the exact same response.\\n\\nSeeing as AGS refuses to even tell me why I got banned or even bother to read my appeals, the only thing that this really tells me is that the claim that Moderators read appeals is a bald-faced lie and any CM who says otherwise is perpetuating this lie.\\nBased on what I did on my account, I suspect someone who RMTs bought my gem or skins and I got flagged as a Gold Seller as based on what I could see, RMT is not necessarily a permanent ban. This was added in my later appeals but same response. My Steam account is an account with over 200 games and is my only used Steam account, to be a used as a Gold seller would be highly illogical. Also, I purchased a pre-release package so its an old account.\\n\\nNow why am I making this review? After reading the forums and Reddit about these posts, there’s usually some people mentioning that their friends also got banned unfairly but just gave up. Seeing as some of these posts are starting to crop up more, I would implore them to make some noise about it so that AGS may finally have to act. At the very least, it can provide a warning to anyone on the fence that this may happen to them and they should be wary. \\n\\ntl;dr - highest ilvl 1462.5, couple lvl 7 gems, sold 2 lvl 7 gems and some skins on the market and got banned. Appeals get a response in 5-10 minutes upholding the ban without saying why I got banned.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The core gameplay of Lost Ark is fantastic. The classes have unique power fantasies and are fun, and the legion raids are some of the most fun activities in any MMO I\\'ve played. Unfortunately, I can\\'t recommend the game since it\\'s bogged down by everything else.\\n\\nFirst off, Lost Ark has a severe gate-keeping problem. The game heavily encourages players to create more characters through events like the powerpass and express pass, and each new character has a set of daily and weekly activities they can do, including three legion raids per week. A total of 6 characters can earn gold from those raids, and the gold and gear reward from those raids form the bulk of gold income for an account.\\n\\nThree raids on six characters is a lot of time, and public groups for them often require proof of previous raid clear experience as a result. After all, nobody wants to waste time on wipes when they have other raids, dailies, and weeklies to do.  If you don\\'t have that visible experience in a new raid (raid titles, gear, very high item level), you potentially face hours trying to get into a group to get that visible experience to make it easier to get into groups. New players coming into the game often can reach the item level and gearing required to complete a raid, but very few experienced players want to play with them. And the game does not provide any incentive for playing with new players. The only way to do the legion raids and get the gear from them as a new player is to buy a paid carry, often using gold from the raid itself. Apart from the gold loss, a negative side effect is that players who buy carries often don\\'t get the mechanical experience of actually doing the raids, which only get more complex and challenging.\\n\\nMeaningfully progressing to the point where gate-keeping is a minor issue requires a lot of time, especially as a new player and even for the first few legion raids. This time multiplies for every character you create. I have 6 characters and doing the daily and weekly activities on them often feels like a part-time job. While rested bonuses build up for dailies you haven\\'t done, the rewards are far less than doing them every day (75-66%), which results in slower progression. The other aspect of dailies that make it feel like a job is they\\'re far less interesting than the raids. The main culprit is chaos dungeons. Chaos dungeons are basic add-clear dungeons which are similar to rifts from Diablo, but the mobs are far less interesting and mechanically complicated. Simply put, they\\'re a chore. They don\\'t encourage the kind of build-crafting and mechanical skill that legion raids do that are the most fun parts of the game. Unfortunately, they\\'re also the most valuable, giving the most amount of materials needed to progress a character. Unfortunately, Smilegate has already said and reiterated that the requirement of doing dailies on each character will not change.\\n\\nThe social systems of Lost Ark is among the worst I\\'ve experienced in an MMO. While guilds exist, the game does not incentivize playing with guildmates. There\\'s no account-wide guild membership system; each character has to join an individual guild and each guild has a low character limit. Combined with the requirement that each character\\'s name be unique, I\\'m often wondering who a character belongs to. The most developed guild feature in the game is a guild shop, which rewards currency for logging on every day and doing weekly quests, which add to the list of activities needed to do on each character. The most meaningful interactions for a guild are on Discord.\\n\\nA lot of the systems I\\'ve criticized have an easy way to circumvent them: by paying real money. With the currency exchange, you can trade money for gold, which allows you to buy almost everything needed to gear up your character: materials for increasing item level, high-quality gear, item quality increases, card set damage bonuses, paid raid carries, and more. Lost Ark even has packages with these items for direct sale. This is the aspect of the game that feels the most \"pay-to-win\", and it unfortunately drives the severe bot problem Lost Ark has.\\n\\nLastly, AGS and Smilegate interactions with the community is lacking. Smilegate in particular does not acknowledge the western version of the game in any way. Despite Smilegate stating they aspire to be a global game developer, it\\'s clear they\\'re far from it. Often AGS community managers won\\'t know if something in a patch or major update until a few days before its released. And the major issues which elicit a sluggish and inadequate response from Smilegate, as the developer, feel as if the western version isn\\'t a priority despite its status as one of the highest-revenue games on Steam. The most they provided to the western audience during their last major yearly presentation, LoA On, was a lackluster English translation. The description of a free reward pack as being \"for the KR region only\" was the insult to injury. This is behavior that is far from other MMO developers like Square Enix, and is in contrast to Smilegate\\'s Korean reputation as being transparent and engaging with their community.\\n\\nI can\\'t recommend this game to a new player. Unless someone new is willing to spend an exorbitant amount of time to gear up and find guilds and parties willing to take on new players, they won\\'t have a good time. Many friends who have similar hour counts to mine have burned out. I\\'ll also likely take an extended break soon, and potentially leave entirely. If new players are gate-kept and experienced players quit, it doesn\\'t feel like a trend that is healthy for the game in the long run.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve played enough to know what this game is and what it is not.  I will start with what it is.\\n\\nLOST ARK IS: \\n- Very pretty.  The graphics are appealing, even if not stunning. We have to remember that this game is not a new game. It has been out in other countries for years. At the time of it\\'s true release though, it was top notch.\\n\\n- Easy to play and navigate. It reminds me of a browser game in that it walks you through each quest and a very \"hand-holding\" kind of way. You get big map markers that tell you right where to go. You don\\'t even need to read the dialogue of NPCs if you don\\'t want to.\\n\\n- Deeper than it seems.  Although it plays like a simple browser game. Lost Ark has plenty of systems to keep a player occupied. There are skill, crafting and even a type of reputation system that allows the player to get more advanced items and stats. There is a lot to sink your teeth into here. I could see spending more time playing with these systems than actually hacking and slashing in some circumstances,\\n\\n- Mostly a true free-to-play game. A player can play all the way through Lost Ark without spending a dime. It may take longer and not be as individualized (you will be playing a cookie cutter version of each character), but it can be done. There are also ways to earn in-game currency if a person really wants to do some customization of their character\\'s looks. There are some features that make the game a \"Pay to Progress\" game, but nothing locks you out of content so you can play it all if you have the patience.\\n\\nLOST ARK IS NOT:\\n\\n- Diablo. The hype train for Lost Ark seemed to be marketed toward fans of Diablo and it\\'s hack n slash mega-loot game play, but this isn\\'t a fair comparison. There are some superficial similarities, but fans of the Diablo franchise won\\'t get their fix from this game. Lost Ark is much more like WoW than Diablo, but even that isn\\'t a great comparison. \\n\\n-A game changer. As with most mega-hyped games, Lost Ark is not going to change the meta when it comes to ARPGs or RPGS. It\\'s a fun game with some complexity, but it doesn\\'t so much do anything new as it incorporates bits and pieces from other games and melds them together.  The wait was so very long for this game that it will take some time before honest reviews are common. There is a glamour spell on the game that will wear off in time to reveal a solid, fun, and less-innovative game than we thought.\\n\\nConclusion: It is a game that fans of the genre should try. There is nothing bad about it. The story is standard good vs evil kind of stuff. They stuff the game with pretty girls and macho boys, just as all such games seem to. It\\'s a decent game that had zero hope of living up to the hype. \\n\\n\\n 7.7 / 10 - Fun. Free. Worth playing.\\n\\n Note that I am not presenting a \"Pro vs Con\" list. I am not that kind of critic. Just because I don\\'t like a feature does not make it bad.  Game Devs make decisions and I am not going to second guess them in a Free to Play game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"While you are in your 24k queue on an EU server here's a guide on how to make pizza dough for a delicious pizza of your choice!\\n\\nIngredients:\\n500g '00' flour or plain flour, plus extra for dusting\\n1 tsp salt\\n½ tsp dried yeast (not fast-action)\\n400ml warm water\\nOil, for greasing.\\n\\nSTEP 1\\nIt’s easiest to make this in a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). Put the flour and salt in the bowl and mix the yeast into the water. It’s always a good idea to wait 5 mins before using the liquid to see if the yeast is working – little bits will start to rise to the top and you’ll know it’s active.\\n\\nSTEP 2\\nTurn on the motor and pour in the liquid. Keep the speed on medium-high and it should come together as a ball. If the bottom is still sticking, tip in 1-2 tbsp of flour. Knead for 5-7 mins until the dough is shiny and it springs back when you press your finger into it. (If kneading by hand, it will take you about 10 mins.) Try not to add too much flour if you can. This is a slightly sticky dough, but that keeps it light and it rises beautifully.\\n\\nSTEP 3\\nUse oiled hands to remove the dough from the hook and bowl. Oil another bowl and place the dough in it. Turn it around so that it’s lightly coated in the oil. Cover tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size. If it’s a hot day, it should only take 2 hrs to rise, but it could take 4 hrs if it’s cold. (If you don’t plan to use the dough for a day or two, place it in the fridge straight away; take it out 3-4 hrs before using. Punch it down first and bring it together on a floured surface.)\\n\\nSTEP 4\\nDivide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls (see Shaping the dough in tips, below) – dust them in flour as they will be sticky. Keep them covered with a tea towel or cling film while you prepare the toppings. (you can also freeze them in sealed bags. Just thaw in the fridge on the day, then bring to room temperature 3 hrs before using.)\\n\\nSTEP 5\\nTo shape the dough: If you want to get air pockets and a light but crisp dough, then don’t use a rolling pin. It flattens and pops the air bubbles. (Two days in the fridge will produce the most air bubbles – take it out three to four hours before using.) If your dough is at room temperature, you can use your fingers to gently stretch the dough out. Once it’s about 16cm, place the disc over the tops of your hands (not palm side) and use them to stretch it further, up to about 25cm. You can start pressing out the other discs, then wait to do the final bit when you’re ready to cook. Once you’ve mastered stretching the dough out, you can experiment with other shapes: rectangles, rounds or squares all look authentic.\\n\\nSTEP 6\\nTo cook the pizza: An outdoor gas barbecue is best for controlling the temperature, but charcoal will give your pizza a more authentic, smoky flavour. For gas, turn the flames down to medium-low so that the bottom of the pizza doesn't burn. When cooking on a charcoal barbecue, let the coals turn grey before you pop on the pizza.\\n\\nSTEP 7\\nPlace the pizza on a floured baking sheet (with no edge) or a pizza peel – this is a flat pizza paddle with a long handle, which makes it easier to get the dough on and off the grill. The flour will provide the 'wheels' for it to slide onto the grill – don’t use oil as it sticks more and won’t transfer as well.\\n\\nSTEP 8\\nMake sure the grill is hot and the flames have died back if cooking on charcoal. Slide the dough onto the grill, close the lid (if your barbecue has one) and give it three to four minutes. The dough will puff up; it's ready when the bottom has light brown stripes. Use tongs to pull the dough off and turn it upside down.\\n\\nSTEP 9\\nAssemble the pizza of your choice – see 'Goes well with', right, for topping suggestions. Remember that less is more, as the dough will stay crisper and the toppings will cook better.\\n\\nSTEP 10\\nPlace the pizza back on the grill, uncooked-side down, and shut the lid. Give it another three to four minutes, then remove when the cheese is melted and the toppings are hot.\\n\\nIf your queue is still not over you may be obligated to go to the pub for a couple of hours!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't recommend this game to anyone, here's why:\\n\\n-gate keeping culture. You won't experience latest content if you're a damage dealer class simply due to lack of supports and abundance of damage dealers. You'll be staring at a lobby screen and scrolling through a dozen of lobby rooms named ''LF SUPPORT'', making your own room is pointless because you'll be waiting for a support for hours only for your party to disband after first wipe. Of course if you have many friends and a guild you're good to go, for the introverts I'm gonna say sorry guys and gals - don't waste your time here.\\n\\n-the western publisher doesn't care. About anything. At all. Taiwanese release has been announced and it promises many ways to deal with bots, one of which is registration using a phone number, employing a real person so he manually bans bots, no censorship on female skins, you get the gist of it. The western release is a short time gamble to squeeze as much money in as little time as possible, my predictions for 2023 will be around 40+ thousand concurrent players gate-keeping each other and crying on official forums by the end of the year.\\n\\n-one of the most toxic communities I've seen, your mistakes during the end-game raids will be intolerable and you'll be swiftly removed from the party. You're a new player ? You'll be playing alone for the first 300 hours. When you reach T3 you'll probably get denied from the parties due to your engravings not being up to their standard. To reach that said ''standard'' you'll have to pay a lot of money for engravings, accessories and gems which either will make you RMT or quit when the realization comes. One of the most unfriendliest game for a new player to ever exist.\\n\\n-the routine of a non-casual lost ark player is to waste 4-6 hours a day managing 6+ alternative characters, doing chaos dungeons, guardian raids, legion raids, abyssal raids with EACH SINGLE OF THEM. If you like doing same monotonous, soul sucking in-game manual labor for 4-6 hours every single day and it's your jam, go for it. It's a classic Korean MMO formula and the soulless grind is the core of it. \\n\\n-currently the world is empty apart from few hub areas, the days are long gone when you would meet a player on a strange remote island, the horizontal content has been done long time ago by the majority of players. This game barely classifies as mmo IMO\\n\\nPlease find another game to play, this ain't it.\",\n",

For all the WoW players out there, imagine LFR but with actual mechanics and no one willing to help anyone so after 20 minutes in queue for the dungeon you need to progress in the game you wipe 2 times and everyone gives up after screaming at each other. Back to 20 minutes in queue to likely experience it again. I guess they fixed the early upgrades at least.\\n\\nTo be clear, I don't think the game is terrible, I actually find it quite fun; when I'm able to play by myself.

       "  'review': \"Original review: https://web.archive.org/web/20221016031156/https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051017496/recommended/1599340/\\n\\nTL;DR: Game is still fun and the chances of it pulling you in are high, but all you'll see at the lower levels will be bots, the inflation caused by the botting is at an all time high, completely decimating the economy, and with how the game functions at 'end game', if you do not find and join a guild IMMEDIATELY, the only way you'll be able to progress your character will be to pay for runs in which you die early on in the fight to get carried through the content. That content being the raids that you may have heard being promoted as the most 'fun' aspect of the game. Not really going to be fun 'playing' the game as a glorified doormat for weeks on end, so find a Guild, fast, if you're serious about playing. Don't expect to find many practice or free carry runs either because time is the most valuable commodity in Lost Ark. The veterans that have the experience to help have 6 characters to run these raids on and do not want to waste hours of their time helping out strangers that have no clue what they're doing, unless you pay them, of course.\\n\\nI left back around early June and decided to return to the game when the 1415 honing buff dropped recently. Figured with the buff, now would be a perfect time to return, right? Ahaha...haha. No.\\n\\nFirst, the bots. Dear lord, the bots. See, back in my day, Punika was a paradise. Sure, you had a few Utytiuwooll's and Frrwyyyojl's around, but every village is going to have a few bad apples, ya know? Well, upon coming back to the game, I see that they have multiplied like rabbit's and are now infesting the whole island. This once peaceful and tranquil paradise, filled love and lailai's is now a nightmarish hellscape with you tripping over these degenerates at every turn. What's even more terrifying is when they run up to you, stare at you with their cold, soulless eyes, and type 'hh'. Why they are trying to communicate now, who knows, but run. Run and do NOT look back!\\n\\nAnyways, upon my return I got my main to 1415, and then decided to try and do a legion raid and queue'd up via matchmaking. Nothing. 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15, 20, 30, 40...Yes, 40 minutes (I am not to proud of this, ngl) spent in a matchmaking queue and the only thing I got done was finishing off a can of dr pepper, eating a granola bar and getting mauled by my cat for not giving him his treat quick enough. (Obviously completely my fault, but I am now a better trained human and have been providing him with his treats in a more timely manner).\\n\\nTurns out, no ones queue's in matchmaking for raids, you got to go into party finder to find a group. Alright, sure, sounds reasonable, right? Nope. See, the issue here is that there are no practice runs available. What I thought would be used for practice, aka matchmaking, is not utilized. So the only runs you're going to find are either bus runs (Pay me 2000+ gold so you can be a glorified dirt ornament as I carry you through the content pleb) or title runs (having the title of killing the boss already so they know you know what you're doing and they not waste hours locked in a run with people who don't know the fight. So basically, they only want to play with others like themselves) or alt runs (And you better be an alt that knows what they're doing, because if you're dying a lot, well, better have some lube ready and lather that sh*t on nice and thick all over cause the verbal assault you're about to be subjected to will be a lot easier to handle before the group quits and unceremoniously kicks your sorry newbie arse out. You're not worthy to play with them).\\n\\nSo if you're new, or you've returned to the game after a hiatus and your guild is, well, dead, find a new one. Immediately. The experience will be a lot better and it'll be mentality healthier for you in the long run. However, if you're one of those Kirito types, and don't want to join a guild cause you're just too cool for one, enjoy progressing through the game at a snails pace since a large chunk of your in game income will go toward the bus drivers. You'll end up either joining a guild or quitting at the end though because eventually you'll realize that paying 2000-4000g for your character to EAT DIRT isn't exactly the game you signed up for. You may think it tastes better cause mommy Vykas stepped in it, but it's still dirt fam. Stop. Just, no. Okay? NO!\\n\\nJoin a guild. Really.\\n\\nThen there is the inflation. Please, for the love of all that is good and holy, do not play on NAW. It is going to cost you anywhere between 2900-3000g for 95 blue crystals, the freemium currency in game. The bots have decimated the economy just about everywhere, but NAW has it the worst. If you're new, try other regions first, as it will be a lot more beneficial for you in the long run in terms of cost. However, bare in mind that there is also no way to transfer your account from one region to another due to 'limitations' according to both Smilegate and AGS, so do keep that in mind.\\n\\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for your time, especially if you're an active player of the game. Honestly, I understand that your time could be better spent on your 5th alt, running your 5th set of raids, on your 10th chaos dungeon and guardian raid for the day. I'd much rather be farming chaos dungeons myself, but it's Saturday and I still haven't found a replacement guild to join, so I figured while I lick and drool all over the cobblestones in Valtan,  I'd at least type up this updated review for the game. Gotta do everything to maximize my time in Lost Ark, amirite?! Hurray for roster progression!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"In LA, you will eventually end up in a loop of incohesive mundane daily/weekly tasks done through window hopping, per mobile game standards, with little to no immersion. (Mobile MMOs fan? Keep reading.)\\n\\nYou will either require multiple alts and a tremendous amount of time to funnel upgrading resources toward your main character or a lot of money to purchase what you need in order to access the latest content on release. (Enjoy grinding/spending? Keep reading.)\\n\\nThat is, if you're lucky enough to make it through the honing(upgrading) system without witnessing all of your efforts and/or money go to waste into the RNG abyss that it is. Playing this game will expose you to gambling in all its glory. It is riddled with it through most of its gimmicks. I'm guessing the feeling I'm trying to extend must be somewhat close to going to the casino on a weekend and losing all of your hard earned money. Which is frankly, not what I'm looking for in an MMORPG. Some will cope with the fact that there is a pity system. Pitiful indeed. Lets be fair though, going to the casino is a choice and so is playing this game.\\n\\nExtra features: \\n                         - World breaking record for game with the longest booting time.\\n                         - Random crashes and/or disconnects without possibility of re-entry into lost content.                      \\n                         - Double digits amount of different currencies to keep things clear...ly confusing.\\n                         - Huge AH fees for minimal profit and maximum salt.\\n                         - A game so fun even hundreds of thousands of bots are playing it.\\n                         - RMTs gold selling spam included. \\n                         - Innovative horizontal content, if you're age 5 and under.\\n                         - Frequent patch delays to keep you on your toes.\\n                         - Last minute announcements for optimal surprise effect.\\n                         - Fantastic transmogs inspired from real life items like, a t-shirt, glasses or a hat.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, LA has some good content but it is weekly gated and vastly outweighed by all the frustrations encountered. Look, I played my fair share, this game seemed to have a lot of potential. The combat system is amazing and refreshing. It was good enough to keep me around hoping it would be a great MMO. Sadly, everything I mentioned above added to the utter disrespect SG and AG seem to have for their customer's time and resources finally got the best of me.\\n\\nI would also like to point out that, by design, LA will make it quite difficult for you to experience the game with your friends. More often than not, I found myself playing on my own, with strangers or even with bots. Everyone would be online simply doing their own thing. (The mobile game template strikes again.)\\n\\nOn a side note, I would consider this game to be pay to progress rather than pay to win.\\n\\nFinally, gaming should be a positive and quality experience, if not at least for the most part. This turned out to be anything but. To each their own opinion, here was mine.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Ok so full honest and fair review on Lost Ark, Im about 50 hours in right now, Lvl 43 (Soft Cap is 50). \\n- Combat - Absolutely one of my favorite combat systems of any game period. Really makes you feel badass every time you engage in a fight, think Diablo mixed with Dynasty Warriors, like just isometric carnage through waves of enemies.\\n- Quests - The highest/Lowest point for me, the game is a theme park at its core, so some quests are legit like being part of a cinematic movie and feel epic and a \"Ride\" while between missions its your standard \"Click, kill X enemies, collect X items\" rinse and repeat mode. \\n- Story - I personally like the story, everything is skippable, so if you dont want it you can move forward but there are some really good cinematic spots that are badass and others that are standard fair but the writing is solid through out but still your standard \"Hero\" story shit.\\n- MMO - Its a full fledged MMO. Groups, Guilds, Raids, Dungeons, PVP, the social aspects are well done and consistent with modern MMOs.\\n- Pacing - The game is extremely well paced imo, you are slowly introduced to game mechanics as you move forward, first 10 levels are standard fight and quest, then 20+ is more dungeons, resource gathering, then 30+ you get your Stronghold which is a full management sim, 40+ you get your ship which is a full-travel and exploration mode, etc etc.\\nClosing thoughts: The game just has a ton of shit to do, so as long as you like the combat enough to stomach the standard fair questing as you progress in unlocking the core mechanics and move on its worth it imo',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Lost Ark [/h1]\\n\\nUnfortunately i can\\'t recommend this game. Despite interesting classes, amazing skills and a enjoyable early-mid game ( leveling up your character ) the late game is just not fun...  You just farm doing same 2-3 stuff everyday then change to your alt character and do exactly the same to propably feed your main character. And then you pray for RNG god to make that 5% honing chance to upgrade your gear level. And you still propably failed it dozens of times. And then you got back to do tidious,boring stuff or joined the pit of hell and payed dozens of $$$ to buy that honing gear only to throw that sweet money of your to oblivion. Again.\\nDespite this and army of bots that is invading the game... u can still have some fun as F2P player like me, there\\'s some really cool scenes/story missions but overall most quest expierence is that you will be most likely just hitting that skip button \"G\". Then kill 2 gyus standing next to the npc or bring some sweet flowers cus he can\\'t pick them from 4 meters from his spot... and your\\'re done for. Do some similiar quest 100 times, then u got that one interesting story mission and of course u guess it.. [b] REPEAT. [/b]\\n\\nUpdate: Bruh because a lot people cry, \"have you never played any mmo!?\" I did, but grinding in Lost Ark fells just unrewarding, unejoyable and boring. If you enjoy doing exactly same thing dozens of time just to have that Number +1 to the equipment then good for you ^_^. \\nIt\\'s my personal opinion and deal with it :D',\n",

       "  'review': \"Me and my friends played Russian version of Lost Ark and already have some kind of opinion on the game. First 50 levels are just spamming G button and it can get boring really fast to the point that you will just quit. Bear with me and get to 50. Maybe to some people story will look interesting, so they won't have any problems reaching level 50. After you reach 50 - - real content starts. Bosses are challenging, dungeons are fun and diverse. You can collect mokoko seeds, cards and other collectible items which give you some advantage. You can sail on your boat to other island and explore them for various content. There is a lot to do in the game. PVP arena is equal so no one can pay their way to highest ranks, It takes skill to get to the top. If you are into PVP - Lost Ark is a must play. This game is a good quality Korean mmorpg.\\nBut it has timegated progress and heavy alt characters dependence. If you want to progress significantly faster - you will need to create alts. Not just one, but many of them. This is a big problem of this game, especially if you never played korean mmorpg before. Basically at the end, Lost Ark becomes your second job if you want to progress faster.\\nAmazon promised less agressive monetisation compared to Russian and Korean versions of the game. Monetisation is not a big problem in this game if you ask me. I have never payed a dime and still enjoyed the game to it's fullest potential. But some people think that it needs some kind of rework. We will see how it pans out.\\nTo conclude my graphomania, give Lost Ark a chance and play it. After all it's a free to play game so you won't lose anything.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"While you are in your 24k queue on an EU server here's a guide on how to make pizza dough for a delicious pizza of your choice!\\n\\nIngredients:\\n500g '00' flour or plain flour, plus extra for dusting\\n1 tsp salt\\n½ tsp dried yeast (not fast-action)\\n400ml warm water\\nOil, for greasing.\\n\\nSTEP 1\\nIt’s easiest to make this in a standing mixer with a dough hook (otherwise mix it in a bowl and knead on your work surface). Put the flour and salt in the bowl and mix the yeast into the water. It’s always a good idea to wait 5 mins before using the liquid to see if the yeast is working – little bits will start to rise to the top and you’ll know it’s active.\\n\\nSTEP 2\\nTurn on the motor and pour in the liquid. Keep the speed on medium-high and it should come together as a ball. If the bottom is still sticking, tip in 1-2 tbsp of flour. Knead for 5-7 mins until the dough is shiny and it springs back when you press your finger into it. (If kneading by hand, it will take you about 10 mins.) Try not to add too much flour if you can. This is a slightly sticky dough, but that keeps it light and it rises beautifully.\\n\\nSTEP 3\\nUse oiled hands to remove the dough from the hook and bowl. Oil another bowl and place the dough in it. Turn it around so that it’s lightly coated in the oil. Cover tightly with cling film and then a tea towel. Place in a draught-free area that’s warm and leave until the dough has doubled in size. If it’s a hot day, it should only take 2 hrs to rise, but it could take 4 hrs if it’s cold. (If you don’t plan to use the dough for a day or two, place it in the fridge straight away; take it out 3-4 hrs before using. Punch it down first and bring it together on a floured surface.)\\n\\nSTEP 4\\nDivide the dough into 2 pieces for big pizzas or 4 for plate-sized ones, then shape into balls (see Shaping the dough in tips, below) – dust them in flour as they will be sticky. Keep them covered with a tea towel or cling film while you prepare the toppings. (you can also freeze them in sealed bags. Just thaw in the fridge on the day, then bring to room temperature 3 hrs before using.)\\n\\nSTEP 5\\nTo shape the dough: If you want to get air pockets and a light but crisp dough, then don’t use a rolling pin. It flattens and pops the air bubbles. (Two days in the fridge will produce the most air bubbles – take it out three to four hours before using.) If your dough is at room temperature, you can use your fingers to gently stretch the dough out. Once it’s about 16cm, place the disc over the tops of your hands (not palm side) and use them to stretch it further, up to about 25cm. You can start pressing out the other discs, then wait to do the final bit when you’re ready to cook. Once you’ve mastered stretching the dough out, you can experiment with other shapes: rectangles, rounds or squares all look authentic.\\n\\nSTEP 6\\nTo cook the pizza: An outdoor gas barbecue is best for controlling the temperature, but charcoal will give your pizza a more authentic, smoky flavour. For gas, turn the flames down to medium-low so that the bottom of the pizza doesn't burn. When cooking on a charcoal barbecue, let the coals turn grey before you pop on the pizza.\\n\\nSTEP 7\\nPlace the pizza on a floured baking sheet (with no edge) or a pizza peel – this is a flat pizza paddle with a long handle, which makes it easier to get the dough on and off the grill. The flour will provide the 'wheels' for it to slide onto the grill – don’t use oil as it sticks more and won’t transfer as well.\\n\\nSTEP 8\\nMake sure the grill is hot and the flames have died back if cooking on charcoal. Slide the dough onto the grill, close the lid (if your barbecue has one) and give it three to four minutes. The dough will puff up; it's ready when the bottom has light brown stripes. Use tongs to pull the dough off and turn it upside down.\\n\\nSTEP 9\\nAssemble the pizza of your choice – see 'Goes well with', right, for topping suggestions. Remember that less is more, as the dough will stay crisper and the toppings will cook better.\\n\\nSTEP 10\\nPlace the pizza back on the grill, uncooked-side down, and shut the lid. Give it another three to four minutes, then remove when the cheese is melted and the toppings are hot.\\n\\nIf your queue is still not over you may be obligated to go to the pub for a couple of hours!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'SOLO player here. After about 65 hours I hit the end of the world campaign. According to some, \"now the real game starts\", but not for me. I have no interest in grinding the same raids over and over, or in worrying about optimizing my build. No, I will continue doing the side quests that I missed, explore the world a bit further, and then stop.\\n\\nAnd at the end of all that, I got a LOT of hours from a free game, enjoying the beautiful graphics, relaxing Diablo-like gameplay and variety in its story. The first continent is the standard medieval knights one, but there are also continents based on steampunk or Kung Fu movies, to name but two. All having the same Diablo-like gameplay. But in Diablo, missions (\"kill everything in an area\") would take half an hour or so, here every mission (\"kill everything\", \"collect something while killing everything\") usually takes a few minutes at most. And then you get a new goal, without any backtracking, because thoughtfully the original quest giver asked you to report to the next for your reward.\\n\\nPay to win? Not at all, if you play it like me. I have not felt the slightest inclination to buy anything. Even your inventory is enormously large, something most MMOs (especially free ones) often limit. And it seems that the economy is aimed fully at the upper levels (that I will never reach). At lower levels, quest rewards might be 200 silver coins, while rewards for simply logging in might be 100,000 silver coins. So as a low-level player, you feel richer than can be expected. You also get a mount very early in the game.\\nI am thinking about spending some real-world money as a \\'thank you\\' to the developers, but I honestly wouldn\\'t know what I should buy with that money.\\n\\nIs there nothing to complain about? Well, you are very limited in how your character looks, when you don\\'t pay for a \\'skin\\'. And I would have liked it if the view was zoomed-out a bit more. And the balancing is a bit off: some of the many systems are introduced (via optional quests) way before they make sense (like optimising your gear while you are still finding better stuff every 10 minutes). Some are introduced before they can even be completed. Like asking me at level 30 to craft something for which I needed gold; I got my first gold at level 50.\\n\\nSo if you go into this game with the aim of spending hundreds of hours on end-game content, look for another review. I see several negative reviews from players with THOUSANDS of hours. But if you are like me, getting 60 hours of fun mindless click-click action for free is good value for money.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After almost 1700 hours in the game I call it quits. Lost Ark is a beautitful game with great combat, unique and fun classes but some systems and mechanics just ruin everything and take all the fun away. I played the endgame and have an army of tier 3 alts but it still doesn't change the basic problems with LA.\\n\\nI hung in there since launch and I've been close to quitting more times but I really so much wanted the game to be a success but decision after decion out of my reach have reduced those chances little by little until I've reached the point where I am today. No more..I want to find a game where I can have fun and not be so frustrated over one unrewarding system after the other. I don't need another job, I want to relax and have a good time, something that has been less and less of the last months.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake is not AGS/SG's fault but I miss having the community feeling. The type of players it attracts don't seem to have a gamers's heart or be (oldtime) mmo players but just random players who want to play and be rewarded fast without any effort. So while it previously was fun taking my army of alts into hardmode content and Argos and earn a nice amount of gold (at least I felt rewarded for all the time and gold I put into them), completely disappeared with the influx of 1370 from one day to another when the power- and hyperpasses were out at the end of July.\\nThe amount of selfish players who don't care about others, nor their own char or the gameplay just piled up until it started being a nightmare and another job to do those hardmodes. Where I could run a dungeon in 10 min before now takes maybe an hour with repetitive wipes because people can't be bothered to gear up their class with sufficent engravings or spend 2 min on watching a video about the mechanics. They expect however others to do  the work instead. Another fun feature that turned into a bitter chore.\\n\\nThe honing system was always a big thorn in my eyes. I accepted how frustrating it was for some time but after 6 months I'm so tired of being on an emotional rollercoaster over an unrewarding system that only has one purpose: to sour up your game time. The few successes you have cannot cover up for all the times you were utterly frustrated over the amount of mats, gold and time you channelled into this system.\\n\\nAbility stones  - another awful system where you have to play casino and maybe win. If not you can go – like my friend just did – and spend 35k gold on getting pheons to buy new ability stones because they kept failing. Who in their right mind design a system that only wants to grieve their players? Stones should never cost anything but gold and the 9 pheons we just had from the event feels more like an insult to the face than anything else. Sometimes I even get a suspicion that the playerbase it being tested. How far can AGS/SG go..how much will the playerbase put up with?!\\n\\nClasses being deliberatedly slow-dripping released  - is another mind buggling decision.\\nI get it – AGS/SG want to milk the game for as much as they can as long as they can  - but the arrogance behind is that they automatically assume everyone to have been on a super hype about the game right from the get go and expect players to be there for years and hence wait for more classes.\\nI only got to know LA right before the launch and despite I'm overall quite content with my bard (and other classes that I've played) I would of course have liked to try out the rest of the classes. However there is nothing that speaks for why I should wait around for a year until all classes from other regions are coming to our version.\\nThat AGS/SG are refraining from giving the West all the classes there are in other regions just feels like another punishement or extremely bad planning – no excitement here about it. AGS/SG took that away already. It's just another annoying issue.\\n\\nIf AGS/SG want to earn dollars and euros so badly they should have done their homework better and prepared all the skins from other regions, so they were ready for the western version already from launch but LA West was skin starved and still is. Players have been literally begging for more skins in the cash shop over the months. Tons of opportunities wasted! \\n\\nGold – somehow it seems there is enough of it for every gamer (in tier 3) if you put time and effort into it but those extraordinary limitations like removing gold from rapporting in starting tiers and limits to the amount of chars (currently max 6) who can earn gold seem so controlling and unnecessary. Why punish the players when AGS/SG should find more permanent solutions against botters and RMTers instead? Why take away the few things which could have sweetened up the game for all players, who have to put up with an otherwise very punishing systems. \\nAlso give me the freedom to level and run as many chars as I please. Let me earn more gold, if I put the time and effort into leveling up the chars.\\nThe direction AGS/SG is taking to solve illegal gaming always involves more limitations and less enjoyment for the normal players these days.\\n\\nI really don't know what kind of expert team that has been supervising the development of these LA systems but basically the premise in this game is the more the player suffer to achieve anything the better. It's supposed to motivate you. Maybe it works for some but not for me.\\nMaybe it's a cultural difference between Koreans, Russians and the West but there is no way I feel more fullfillment, excitement or enjoyment in the game  by being exposed to punishing mechanics on a daily basis. It's only aggravating and demotivating.\\n\\nThe game has some sweet features like Sailing, Strongholds, Adventure tome exploring, Rapporting, Mokoko hunting etc. etc. but they are sadly all minor and can't cover up for the big unfullfilling feeling and lack of joy the rest of the game gives you.\\n\\nI'm sure I'm gonna miss parts of LA and I will keep an eye out for LA over the next year but for now my adventure ends. I've really got my money's worth of it but enough is enough.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"This game started off amazing.  Huge playerbase, everyone was learning the mechs, and the combat was absolutely seamless. No class felt super overpowered and all was right. However, the grind is incredibly tedious. Daily tasks are absolutely mind-numbingly boring and repetitive. I've played almost every day since launch and I wouldn't recommend to start playing now. Inflation is skyrocketing and it's impossible for new players to catch up. Progression  is limited by so many currencies and materials that you'll always encounter some sort of barrier, whether it be gold, silver, shards, or honing materials. Running low on currency? Sell your materials. But wait, if you sell your materials, how will you progress? You can't. \\nWant to play a DPS? Good luck, the giga whale who's 40 levels above you will always be accepted first, and you'll be stuck in a waiting lobby praying for a support to join your room. \\nRaids are fun, but if one person keeps messing up the mechanics, all fun is lost. Overall, the game was incredible at first, but absolutely piss-poor now. Combat and graphics are still incredible, though.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'It is important to start with that I do not review games. Though I am making an exception for Lost Ark. \\n\\nMany players found they either started the game due to hype, friends asking them to join, or they had been tracking it since its Korean and Russian release. Once you start playing the game it is simple enough the combat system is kind of similar to ARPGS, not new but something different. This is where many players will praise the game for combat being smooth and refreshing. You level quickly enough and the dungeons seem fun as you progress a B list story. You are awed and impressed with the in game visuals and the feeling that you\\'re making progress. Then you hit 50 and everything shifts ever so slightly. You now are at Vern and you have shifted away from gathering gear to honing the same set. Nothing too drastic, the mats are not awful and the success rates are 100%. North Vern is now completed and for the first time you get a notification that you must hit a certain gear level before you can progress, something is starting to feel off but you can not put your finger on it. You manage to gather mats with daily quests that are very repetitive, running chaos dungeons which are mat pinatas, and you play around on islands or do events that have no real purpose other than to get you more mats/shinies.\\n\\nAfter a decent effort you finally hit the required gear level and you have felt the sting of the honing failures but it is still not overly painful. You get to Rohendal and you feel even more like something is off, things you got in the habit of doing now are just not able to be done any more. You can not really gather Makoko seeds as easily and starting to realize the fun combat is starting to feel a tad repetitive. Another notification that you must further hone your gear and this is when that feeling starts to actually manifest into something tangible. Your gathering mats for a chance to improve your gear and the success rate is dropping rapidly. You ask around for methods on how best to gather these mats and are told this is an Alt friendly game. So you spin up some alts, burn those two nice Vern power passes and have two more level 50 characters at your disposal. That feeling grows even stronger, each of these new toons also needs to hone gear, but why did you already spend weeks doing it on the first character you made. So you start gathering mats on them to pass to your Main, only to find out not all materials are roster bound, that seems like a problem. Now you\\'re logging in daily on multiple characters to gather the mats that are tradeable and after you have enough you spin the honing wheel to lose most of them.\\n\\nNow you\\'re finally on your way to Yorn, you soldier through it because by this point you\\'re no longer exploring islands or doing much else than gathering materials to keep your gear score going up. Vindication, you get a new set of gear that causes that very strong feeling to finally be put into a word \"Dread\". The game is no longer hiding that almost everything is RNG, especially honing which is a mandatory exercise you can not escape. Also the frustration starts to build as you realize those alts can no longer help gain materials because they are still Tier 1 and can not help you anymore. Do you grind them up to help with Tier 2 or do you focus only on that one character. Tier 2 honing is just as rough as Tier 1 and you\\'re doing it again with higher material requirements. By the time you hit Feiton you have come to understand nothing else in this game matters as much as gathering materials to fail at honing your gear. \\n\\nThe promise of great things to come is what your peers tell you while the developers tell you to go at your own pace. The dungeons are kind of pointless now because they are just there to do once or twice for low amounts of honing materials. Say you finally get your character to the coveted Tier 3, guess what you\\'re starting the gear honing grind again and now it is even worse than before. If you want to log in every day for login rewards, do dailies religiously, participate in events only there to feed your material addiction, and just repeatedly get told your feelings are wrong. Maybe Lost Ark is for you. Spelling out these things is only to encapsulate the reality that the publisher/developers decided for greed or ignorance to force NA/EU to toil in Tier 1 and Tier 2 for now. All you have to do is watch videos from Korea and see that this is not what new players on those servers experience. The focus is to get players to Tier 3 so they can all enjoy the same content together and not telling them to play at their own pace. Yes there are Pay to Win aspects, but everyone says it can be avoided with time and the game does not force you to do that if you\\'re willing to stick with it.\\n\\nBetween an underdeveloped community that can be toxic only a month in and some of the worst game support you will ever experience for an MMO. The Western Lost Ark NA/EU release is horrible. Yes there is something that could be great about this game, but that is not what was delivered, and right now there is no road map for it to get where other regions already are. The largest issue I have experienced is the honing rates and it is clear the publisher/developer are not willing to address this because that is not the vision they have for NA/EU.\\n\\nI recommend to anyone considering this game \"Do Not Waste your Time\". Three hundred hours in and a good chunk of money spent to try to support a game that promised to be everything it is not right now. Sure the game could become great just like other regions, it is not currently, and the longer folks stay or keep joining will only further encourage the continuation of the horrible state that is in major need of improvements. At this point it is obvious that NA/EU are getting the worst version this game has to offer. I understand this was long and thank you to those that made it to the end.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'After almost 830 hours, hear me out. \\n\\nThe game started off solid. to be honest, the content was a little overwhelming and I loved it. The combat was a breath of fresh air in terms of MMO combat systems. \\n\\nHowever, the grind is very real. I think this has to be the most grindiest game I\\'ve ever played, and usually that isn\\'t a problem for me. But the rewards for said grind just don\\'t feel worth it. Everyone says the real game starts at level 50 and an iLvl of 250, and that is very true. But it never ends. From that point on the game becomes one huge grind fest to increase your iLvl and it HAS to be done. Content in this game is gated behind iLvl, from certain horizontal activities to end game dungeon content.\\n\\nAgain, it wouldn\\'t be so bad but this game relies on a \"Honing\" system that requires materials, gold and silver to increase the power and iLvl of your gear. Materials, gold and silver are not plentiful unless you spend cash. The success rate of these hones decreases significantly the higher you go, to the point that you eventually are given the upgrade because you\\'ve failed so many times. Can it be done? Of course, with an extreme amount of time invested. But this game heavily leans towards P2W. Not in the traditional sense, you don\\'t actually win anything, but in the sense that you feel like you HAVE to pay to progress. \\n\\nAt ILvl 1400, the end game is extremely lackluster. You get 1 raid that can be done once a week. 2 dungeons that can be done once a week, 2 chaos dungeons (main source of honing materials that actually don\\'t give you anywhere near enough materials to actually hone successfully) twice a day for rewards and a guardian raid (another source of materials) once a day (for rewards).\\n\\nIn the end, I found myself logging in, doing my dailies and logging out into an alt (needed to do dailies so that you can \"feed\" your main with materials)\\n\\nIF you have no issues swiping that card, by all means, play this game. If that isn\\'t your style, you can certainly progress, just at a much, MUCH slower pace. \\n\\nIt was fun while it lasted, but unless something changes in terms of available resources, reduced honing costs, more end game content and engaging horizontal progression, I won\\'t be coming back. \\n\\nOh. And bots. Bots. BOTS. This game is flooded with them to  the point you\\'ll see 100 bots to every 1 real player.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Although I had a high number of hours in the game, I want to say at least half that was spent idling the game in one form or another, since it doesn\\'t auto-close if you trigger the afk disconnect. \\n\\nI\\'ve uninstalled it for three reasons: \\n\\n1) AGS sucks. AGS protecting our wallets is a meme in the community because they are so slowly releasing more of the (I\\'m not kidding) hundreds of skins present in the South Korean version of the game. The company devoted themselves fully to dripfeeding the worst looking skins in the entire catalog, 1-2 per month, long term.\\n\\n2) The bot problem is so out of control, it\\'s just as infested as Runescape 2 was by bots in 2005-2006. Bots in Lost Ark swarm like locusts clustering together across the starting areas of the game and the major cities zooming around with their speedhacks along the same paths. They also spam advertisements in area chat, which happens to be the one chat where anyone bothers to say anything, so you have to put up with the spam and blocking and reporting to see any human conversations in the game. \\n\\nLife skills as a result of the bot population are close to worthless. Infinite chaos dungeons are a very boring alternative for making more gold and I\\'m certainly not swiping my credit card to progress faster either. Let me put infinite chaos dungeons to you this way: some people I\\'ve spoken with ingame have described grinding them out as \"brain melting\". Others claimed it was a guaranteed road to burning out. Lost Ark players reading this may counter, \"If you need gold, just make alts!\". I\\'m getting to that.\\n\\n3) The gameplay loop is so simple and stale. If you make 6 characters, expect 2.5-3 hours of chaos dungeons and guardian raids you\\'ve already done, every single day or every 3 days if you want to get optimal gold and material gains. Argos will add even more time to your weekly quota, though it will get easier in the future as people outgear him. If reset day came and you aren\\'t running 6 1370 characters, lord help you, it\\'s time to spam abyssal dungeons which are a massive time sink across 6 alts even if you party finder for varying reasons. Maybe your teammates don\\'t understand mechanics. Maybe party finder is slow during your time of play. Maybe your teammates just want to make everyone sit through cutscenes (which require a unanimous vote to skip). If you think like me, someone who simply cannot play games in as a casual for very long, you have to play more than 3 hours a day if you want to go participate in the other content in the game, like quests, or the many collectibles or even the time gated islands that only appear a few times a day. \\n\\nIt is so easy to burn out with the current gameplay loop that even Smilegate\\'s own past statistics reflect a massive decrease in the South Korean playerbase during their version of this era of the game (pre-Legion Raids). Smilegate must have made a lot of money back then to force the Western regions to experience the same hellish era. \\n\\n* In writing this review, I came to realize a fourth reason I\\'m done playing the game. \\n\\n4) Waiting 3 days is possible because of rested bonus, which the community generally considers time-efficient. I was obligated to ask myself after waiting for rested bonuses enough times on my alts, \"Why am I waiting 3 days to play a game on a specific character?\". My answer took shape as, \"The game is almost like a bad job, the chores are so tedious\". I have never encountered another mmorpg to make me feel so bored. If I got bored in BDO, for example, I could go ride my turbo horse around the region, I could go fish, I could jump my Tamer mount off mountains for fun. If I got bored in Runescape, I could play minigames, something Runescape did best. If I got bored in Path of Exile, I could make a new build, run special maps or decorate my hideout extensively. \\n\\nLost Ark\\'s side activities are nowhere near as entertaining as the ones I\\'ve encountered in other mmos, except for PVP. Smilegate\\'s game is so extraordinarily barebones when it comes to its fun activities that I feel like it meets the bare minimum requirements to pass as a game outside of its dailies. It feels like a very poorly made skinner box. Legion Raids will improve upon my complaints but not enough to bring me back. Miraculously, Smilegate\\'s mmorpg convinced me to look for enjoyment in my creative hobbies again.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Uh I have played Lost Ark for 3500 hours, So this will be an interesting/ HONEST review.  The game is closing in on 1 year old for NA/EU so keep this in mind as I speak my opinion about this game.....\\n\\nWhere to start..... Lost Ark was a game that I had first seen a gameplay trailer for KR back in like 2015, me and the squad were SOOOO HYPE about this game I cannot lie. Was this the Diablo killer we were waiting to play? Years down the road we now have it in our hands getting to experience a game that has been out for years before us.\\n\\nWhen first playing Lost Ark at launch the \"magical feeling\" was present - kinda like a honey moon phase per say. The phase where everything was exciting, new, and fresh. Your homies were all in it, hype af and ready to play every moment they got a chance to! Right???  Ya well that phase lasted about 2 -3 months because the daily chores you feel obligated to do dissolves that feeling away shortly after you reach the tip of endgame and start the REAL grind. You would think new updates and new classes introduced to the game would help ease the unexciting and dull dailies you do to keep up with the current content would rejuvenate the freshness ...... Nah sadly if it does its very short lived - To even get a new character caught up with the pack is a grind. Powerpass, Hyperpass, Expresspass, Punicapass, Megapass, Ultrapass, Gigapass!!!! Doesnt matter how its worded its still all a tedious grind to the top - \"The Hamster wheel keeps turning\" as my best friend likes to tease us few still playing...... lol\\n\\nListen I genuinely enjoy Lost ark and everything it presents - I also genuinely dislike a lot of things that it brings. I will just touch on a few from each side.\\n\\nWhats good ? \\n- Gameplay. -  Lost Ark has some of THE BEST raiding content I have ever been a part of. It doesn\\'t get much better then this currently. Lost Ark has some on THE BEST visuals from a game running on an old engine. UE3 I think? Lost Ark has some of THE BEST Character Identities I have seen In a game recently. \\n\\n- Mass amount of content -   Lost ark has a   C R A P  ton of content available to players from start to finish. Like more then I am personally WILLING to go hunt for,  track down, and complete. Like its a lot!!!!! \\n\\n\\nWhats Bad ?\\n*Some of this will be hard to put in words to where others who might not have played it yet or play its as much will understand.* \\n\\n- The games Core Design - \\nOk, Lost Ark is VERY VERY poorly designed to introduce and bring in new players..... I feel like once the game reached a specific amount of content added to the base game,  it is now EXTREMELY hard on new players/characters to be mixed in with the current pool of players who have been playing since launch. \\n\\nAll the shear amount of intricate things needed to be \"Accepted\" in the raiding scene, (which is the biggest highlight of Lost Ark dont forget!!!) is near impossible for new players to obtain and jump in with friends or even experience the game properly...... New Account? Low Roster level? \"Nope\"  gatekept!  Character doesnt have all +lvl7 gems or higher? \"nope\" gatekept! Your character is level 52.45 not max level 60?! \"Nope\" gatekept!  You dont have Grudge lvl3 ? \"Nope\" GATEKEPT! You dont have 5x3 BiS engravings? \"Nope\" G A T E K E P T.  Keep in mind this is just a handful of many more problems this game has when it comes to the Vertical content pushing, every single one of these issues isn\\'t like you can get all these fixed in 24hours - No its a grind. Month at BEST for a new player maybe even longer..... I mean unless you swipe...... Legally or Illegally  and Im not opening that flood gate...... -_-\\n\\nI dont blame the people who are gatekeeping - I blame the way the game is designed and its poor in many ways on that note. \"Great Vision - Poor Delivery\" \\n\\n- Anti-Cheat system - \\nThe anti-cheat system used in the NA Version of Lost Ark is so bad its sad. Like Depressingly Sad. not sure how else to put it. \\n\\n- Bots - \\nBots run Rampant in the game, Amazon has yet to figure out a solution to clean it up and remove them in our version of the game. So it genuinely sours the early to mid gameplay experiences new players have when they have their first play through....... You will see many  characters named Yyyggdsfdfghesfdf running around on horseback with the new mokoko tag next to their name stating they are a fresh account. Yep. -_- What makes this a sticky fix, is the fact that this is Free to Play, you can ban wave thousands of bots - give them 48 hours and they are sprawling back to farm up gold. \\n\\n\\nAt the end of the day Lost Ark is a Dope game, that has A LOT of room to grow in the western client. But also has a lot of problems that get swept under the rug with greedy game design. I also understand this game is developed by another culture and that\\'s partly just a way of life in some parts of the world. But I also can play a game for almost 4k hours and see glaring holes that need to be fixed or filled to boost a games integrity from a player base POV. \\n\\nIts really hard to give an Honest review like this when you have invested time like this in a game. But for what its worth, I give this game a 6/10 ONLY because it has so much good going for it. If AGS and Smilegate would genuinely crack down on the problems and commit to the issues the game has my review and rating would be vastly different. \\n\\nHope this helps people who have never played but also people who are still currently playing for better or for worse. \\n\\nHappy Holidays - SlimB',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m sad to say that my very first review is a negative one and am only doing so in hopes the devs can turn this around. Below will be a list of the major issues with the game at the moment.\\n\\nIt is very hard these days for me to become completely enveloped with a game. Lost Ark stole my soul... but I sadly cannot recommend anyone to play this with the current state of the game, I really wish I could. It is an incredibly good game with all of the necessary components to compete with the monsters in the MMO genre but the Smilegate and Amazon just seem to be making all the wrong decisions.\\n\\nBefore you judge my review, keep in mind as of the date of this review (6/14/2022) I am roster lvl 172, most horizontal content done and have a 1460, 1420, 1385x2, 1370 x2, and 4 1340\\'s. Cleared all content available in the game on the week released and am entirely free to play minus cosmetics for my character, battle pass and some founder packs. The amount of time and effort i\\'ve put in to stay at currently released content is staggering as you can see by my hours.\\n\\nIF the issues I list below, specifically the botting/RMT issues, see fixes or adjustments this game is absolutely worth playing... but I don\\'t see them recovering from this one.\\n\\n1. Bots\\n\\nI have played a ton of MMO\\'s ranging from dead to prosperous, f2p and subscription based. All of them have bot issues, but nothing like this. I wish I was exaggerating when I say this game easily has 500k+ bots if not more but i\\'m not. It has destroyed the in game economy and made que\\'s to even log in 10,000-20,000 long. The devs are barely slapping the wrist of RMT purchasers and do roughly once a month ban waves targeting bots that accomplish nothing. I know it isn\\'t an easy thing to fix, no MMO has... but their attempts have only damaged the game play of real players whilst leaving a minor annoyance to the botting community.\\n\\n\\n2. The Grind\\n\\nInitially I was super pleased with the middle ground this game has, most KR MMO\\'s have systems in which gear downgraded or completely deleted if it was to fail an upgrade. Lost Ark has the happy medium of doing neither whilst provided a fail stack that guarantees you will successfully upgrade after enough fails. It still leaves in the gamble RNG dopamine hits without having infinite punishment. Sounds great right? It was... until you realize you either have to run 6+ characters to feed materials to your main to make any meaningful progress or simply swipe your credit card. EVERYTHING is time gated other than MSQ. Anything that provides materials for upgrade honing is locked behind daily/weekly content. Normally this doesn\\'t bother me but the amount of materials you receive daily in the end game is barely enough for one very low chance click a day with a few more on weekly reset. Without moderate luck you will go nowhere without tons of alt characters.\\n\\n\\n3. The leadership and communication of AGS and SGS.\\n\\nTheir communication is abysmal. They just can\\'t seem to do it... It\\'s gotten a little better in terms of talking to us about things but it\\'s a stretch to even get patch notes or an hour heads up on emergency maintenance\\'s with little to no compensation of any kind let alone an apology. In the beginning the lead developer openly stated he wanted all regions to catch up to KR as soon as possible (Korea has vastly more content than us at the moment as it was released years ago there), they have broke this promise dozens of times already in major ways. The community has collectively asked for more skin releases, more class releases faster, and all sorts of basic things along those lines in which they claimed they heard us and are working on it. Their solution? Release an RNG lootbox skin that on average takes $700 USD to complete, 1 skin a month that is hand selected from the worst selling skins in other regions and changing class releases from once a month to one every 2 months. Keep in mind ALL of this content we are asking for is ALREADY in the game in multiple other regions, it requires 0 development only localization. They openly admitted that their decision for some of these changes were based off of purely what would make them the most money as they are \"Valuable moments for us.\" I\\'m all for a company making money, especially if they deserve it, but they have lost millions basing their decisions off of business analytics where they misread the data. Out of all the MMO\\'s i\\'ve played this one\\'s leadership is by FAR the worst i\\'ve encountered. A huge majority of their decisions are made on milking money from players which in turn is backfiring and causing them to lose vastly more than by just doing the right thing.\\n\\n\\nThere are many other minor issues but they hail in comparison to the 3 above. However, the major 3 are so severe that it\\'s just a deal breaker straight up for the community. Lost Ark had so much promise and can still be turned around... At it\\'s core it\\'s still one of my favorite MMO\\'s I have ever played. Amazing combat, raids, systems, and immersive world with a below average story (It does get better way later in the game!) Steer clear of this one though unless this is farther in the future and these problems have been addressed to some degree, in which case I would wholeheartedly recommend this game 100%.\\n\\nThanks for taking the time to read my review and I wish you luck finding a game for you.\\n\\n**Edit: Some spelling/grammar changes.',\n",

       "  'review': 'On 3-2-2022 I received a permanent ban on Lost Ark for Commerce Lock.\\n\\nThe reason I was told I received this ban was due to a refund of a steam purchase I had made of the Founders pack of Lost Ark before the game Launched for early head start. Purchase was originally made in August of 2021 and Refunded on Jan 30th 2022.  I have screen Shots of all mentioned transactions.\\n\\nThe reason I did this refund was because I was trying to decided on which founders pack was of the most value to me and could provide the most benefit.  I ended up deciding the next day Jan 31st to purchase all packs offered (Including the Founders Pack I was Banned For) and I continued to purchase all available packs that were released after. \\n\\nThis ban should be reversed as customers like myself who not only did not realize we were doing a ban able offence, but as well a lot of players have invested money into your game with all packs, gems, etc. \\n\\nIt is unfair and unjust practice to be banned from playing due to mistakes on refunds, especially when those refunds were issued before your game was released and players never received in-game items.\\n\\nI have never had a ban on any of my 400+ steam games and I am highly disappointed that Amazon Game Studios was the first. Especially given the reasoning.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Since I only have about 10 hours sunk into the game so far and I am very much so in \"early-game\" still, I would like to chime in on the concerns/complaints that I am seeing around Lost Ark in its early stages... Now, as far as pacing goes, if you decide to play the game for free, it is quite slow. I noticed that almost immediately. Personally I am not against a slower pace as I prefer to take my time with things - I am the kind of guy that actually reads the text when I am doing quests - so for me that is not an issue. The story so far is captivating and interesting in my book so that helps tremendously with the slow pacing of the game. The art style is very typical Korean/Japanese/Asian so if you are not a fan of that, probably best to stay away - though you might enjoy it regardless. I personally LOVE the style of art and the visuals are crazy good in Lost Ark, especially the abilities of the classes. \\n\\nWhilst my opinion is of course subject to change as time goes on, there is no harm in trying this game - since it is free - and giving it a shot if you are on the fence about it.',\n",

Every single thing you can do is extremely timegated and they even go as far as to stretch out your daily chores by timegating fast travelling, so you better plan around that or have some cash ready to remove the timelock from your fast travel. It\\'s absolutely the most insane shit I\\'ve ever seen in a non-mobile game. \\n\\nAnd the worst thing about this is, that despite all the time gating, it still doesn\\'t respect your time. You can spend all your free time on the same mindless crap with pitiful rewards and still get absolutely nowhere.\\n\\nReally disappointing, because the game\\'s combat system and world design are genuinely beautiful.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh dear,\\n\\nI\\'ve been waiting for the game since the first video of the Closed Beta Test in Korea. Was so hyped about MOBA-like action RPG about a tripod system making it an ultimate skill-based MMORPG.\\n\\nThe first [b]10 hours[/b] start like with every other MMORPG game, you make your character and progress through the story. The problem is when the story is just [b]G spam[/b] clickfest and a walk from NPC to NPC, with tons of fetch quests in between.\\n\\nAfter [b]15 hours[/b] when you reach the 1st main city, you are unlocking the first [b]Chaos Dungeons[/b], and after some time [b]Abyssal Dungeons[/b]. The first one you can do only [b]two times[/b] per day for rewards, Abyssal Dungeons are once per week.\\n\\nThey are telling you that you don\\'t need alts to progress, so I did 5 alts so 6 classes in total. I was progressing 6 times faster than my other guildmates. I can only imagine that someone living in a 20square apartment playing video games 17 hours a day can progress 12times faster than me, you get the point.\\n\\n[b] At 200 hours mark [/b], I had 6 characters in T2 and one character in T3 content (tiers are like levels of content you are currently on)\\n\\n[b]My daily routine was:[/b]\\n\\n- run 2x chaos dungeon on 6 characters (6mins each)\\n- run 3x una daily tasks on 6 characters (5mins each)\\n- run 1x daily island (10-15mins each)\\n- run 1x daily chaos or boss run (10-15 mins each)\\n\\nand I was doing this [b]EVERY... SINGLE... DAY... :[/b] since the early access.\\n\\nI finally reached the level of 1st \"hard content\" called [b]Abyssal Raids[/b].\\nAfter clearing an Argos P1 in 5 mins I realized how dumb I was chasing the carrot that kept saying to me: it will be better later on...\\n\\nEnd game of Lost Ark looks like this:\\n1. You do the dailies until you can clear raids.\\n2. Clearing raids leave you with locked content until next week, so you are left with repetitive daily una tasks and chaos dungeons, that are brainless mob clearing grindy runs.\\n3. Do the horizontal progress (collectables)\\n4. Rinse and repeat.\\n\\nSo when the fun starts?\\n\\nWell, after you grind your way to the hardest content you can play, its about 20 to 30 mins of [b]FUN[/b] content per week, per chracter. So you can figure it out by youself.\\n\\nAlso worth mentioning in huge TLDR:\\n\\n- you can buy materials off the cash shop\\n- you can buy gold off the cash shop\\n- you can basically buy anything from cash shop even boost of characters (in future releases)\\n- BOTS BOTS BOTS (yeah that much a repetitive content is perfect for automatization, so there are bots destroying econemy every single day)\\n- to be efficient, you have to fit your life schedule to the game, as horizontal progress is time gated, at a specified time of the day/night)\\n\\n[h1] HOWEVER [/h1] [i]ending words... [/i]\\n\\nThe version of the game we\\'ve got was the worst one from KR. The game looks good and the diversity of the characters and their playstyles makes it like you almost want to play the game. PVP is balanced as its gear is equalized. English dubbing isn\\'t that bad (I\\'ve seen worse), and despite all those negatives above, I can tell that If the game gets more and more updates, It might make the review end in a positive way, but for now it\\'s a huge NO for me.\\n\\nI don\\'t recommend the game... for now.\\n\\nEDIT 23.04.2022: Formatting.',\n",

       "  'review': '// OUTDATED: I don\\'t play Lost Ark anymore, it takes way too much time to get to anywhere if you don\\'t spend a lot of money on it.\\n\\n\\nWithin the past few days I\\'ve read hundreds of Lost Ark reviews on Steam, out of curiosity and... it\\'s exactly how I thought it\\'d be when the game started to be free to play. Number of shitty reviews that occurred since then is ridiculous. Whereas positive ones don\\'t tell you anything about the game and just fill up the space in reviews tab, people that gave the game negative review made me want to write a review myself. I haven\\'t read such bullshit about any game in years, so let me try to put things straight. \\n\\nFirstly, I would like to say that I\\'m not a huge fan of Lost Ark, just so you don\\'t call me fanboy defending his favorite game. Despite my playtime on Steam, I haven\\'t been playing the game as long and as much as other \"veterans\" from KR/RU. Although I started months before Lost Ark was even announced to be released in EU/NA, I played the game for only 1100+ hours. That\\'s maybe 2 hours a day on average but I still think it\\'s enough and it\\'s way more than majority of peoples\\' playtime here. Also, most of my playtime is from RU version which is considered the most \"pay to win\" version out of all.\\n\\nBefore full release the game had overwhelmingly positive reviews (96-98% positive from closed alpha/closed beta) and now it fluctuates around 70%.\\nLost Ark was (and still is) a very hyped MMO. People expected much. I think too much. If you are just a bit clever you should know that there could be problems with launching the game, especially when it\\'s an MMO genre. Not to mention that publisher in our region was AGS.\\n\\nMost of negative reviews are from people that are crying about queues, bad story, the game being \"pressing G simulator\" or petty problems that can be fixed within few minutes using Google. Maybe 2-3% of all reviews have any sense and are worth reading. The rest is trash. It\\'s picking apart you could do with any other MMO. Here are some very popular statements that people keep repeating over and over in their garbage reviews, just so you know and don\\'t spread shitword all over again:\\n\\n1. The game is made on UE3 - it is, so what? Everyone says the game starts to look outdated - ok, it\\'s subjective. Some people can say the graphics are bad, others can say the graphics are good, but why nobody mentions animations which are excellent or the fact that the game is extremely well optimized? You can run this game on potato, I\\'m having 100+ FPS on Ryzen 5 3600 & GTX 1660 Ti on very high settings in every area/dungeon/raid. You can\\'t have it all. Decide what\\'s more important to you - graphics or playability. Lost Ark to this day still looks good and runs even better.\\n\\n2. The game is P2W - show me at least one mechanic in this game which is pay to win. I think peoples\\' definition of P2W in 2022 equals to \"I can spend money on a game so the game is pay to win\". The game is pay for progress/pay for convenience, there\\'s like nothing you can get for real money but can\\'t get for money in-game. PvP content is equalized so your item level doesn\\'t matter. The only content that might be considered as pay to win are GvG \\'cause gear actually matters but nobody will buy you knowledge or skill (and you don\\'t have to attend GvG at all, it\\'s optional).\\n\\n3. The story is boring as hell - it is, you\\'re right. But let\\'s be honest, who cares about story in MMO? Despite the fact that story is boring as hell, there are still some cutscenes that are touching or actually well made (and you can\\'t skip them). If you really want to play MMO mainly for plot then run FF14, unless you can name any other MMO with decent story.\\n\\n4. The game is pressing G simulator - it is, you\\'re right. But if you\\'re out of the woods and finish tutorial, it changes. There is no spamming \"G\" for 10 hours in a row with zero other activities anymore. You can do whatever you want. I must admit that leveling process gets dull very fast and is a huge mistake but name me any other MMO in which leveling is as entertaining as end game.\\n\\n5. The game is queue simulator/matchmaking simulator - sometimes it is, sometimes it is not. Queue depends on which region/server you play on and when. At night, in the morning or in the afternoon there are barely queues (maybe with little exception for the weekends) so the only problem are evenings. If you have job, move to another region just so you can play without queues anytime or just wait for casuals to quit the game and keep playing on the region you\\'ve started playing before. When it comes to matchmaking - yes, it\\'s laggy most of the time but slowly gets better. We can just hope that litter employes from AGS start doing something to fix it as they did with IS and Aura.\\n\\n6. There is nothing to do in the game - people saying so have no clue what game they are playing or they watched Twitch streamers for too long and don\\'t know where to begin the rush to their idol\\'s item level. There is so much to do that you won\\'t finish the game within several months, even if you played 24/7 on one character. There is a lot of PvE content (Chaos Dungeons, Guardians, Cubes, Towers, Boss Rushes, Abyssal Dungeons, Abyss Raids, Legions, Gates and more), a lot of casual content (sea content, events, islands, Platinum Fields, quests, housing system, collectibles, adventure book, affinity with NPCs, life skills and more) and even some PvP content (equalized arena with rankings, PvP on islands and GvG).\\n\\n7. The combat gets boring very fast - I think the combat system is one of the best when it comes to isometric MMOARPG games. There are different types of skills (direct, aim, hold, timing, preparation, combo, chain) and there are a lot of skills for each class out of which only 8 (in most scenarios) can be put onto skill bars. Additionally, there are runes, gems and tripods that can change the way the skill behaves and so on. Even if you play the same class as your friend, you can vary a lot from them. Every spell and auto attack is also a skillshot, there is no auto aim so if you are bad you can miss everything (except spells like shields for yourself for example). The hitboxes of players and bosses are pretty accurate too.\\n\\nI ran out of space so if you wonder about any other concerns, read my comments down below.\\n\\n\\nAnother conclusion I came to: \\nI think people forgot that games should bring pleasure. Especially MMO games which are no competitive at all (or are very little competitive in comparison to FPS or MOBA games). Nowadays everyone wants to be the very best. Such people watch Asmongold or other popular streamers that spend a lot of money and push themselves to the end game, and then they want to do the same. They completely ignore everything else and forget what they were supposed to do with the game and what\\'s the game about. That\\'s why afterwards we see reviews from people that have 50, 100 or even 200 hours into the game and are bored after getting to X item level. They say they don\\'t enjoy the game but how can they enjoy it if they spent all time doing garbage storyline quests and upgrading their gear for god knows what reason?\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: In my opinion, Lost Ark is one of the best MMOs ever made but published by one of the worst publishers ever seen. The game itself is very good and once you manage to suffer for the first 10-20 hours to get past tutorial, you will probably stay for a while. Sadly, Amazon is responsible for servers and item shop, and they fucked up both of them - servers are laggy, game is sometimes a queue/matchmaking simulator and we don\\'t know what they add to IS in the future. Once the servers are fixed, Lost Ark will probably be top 1 MMO on Steam for months or even years. Content is ready to be released, the game is very polished and refined overall, all classes are very balanced and playable, the game is player friendly and very well optimized and the most important - the game respects your time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Ive never felt so conflicted about a game. Like, as a game its top notch. Ive had fun doing literally everything the game has to offer. The game play is tight, the game runs well, you can tell the game is made with real care and detail. There are things in this game ive never seen in an mmorpg and just a general level of creativeness that genuinely impressed me. The boss fights are an absolute blast and, again, had some basic but creative mechanics that surprised me in the best way.\\n\\nThen...the elephant in the room. Lets cut the shit. The games progression pathway is designed to suck you in. Resources are plentiful. Upgrades fire off without failing. Your personal damage grows MASSIVELY fast after hitting 50 it feels so damn good. However, the farther you get the more you can see plain as day that the systems are designed to frustrate you enough to get you to pay. You run out of readily available resources and have to farm it out but your upgrades are failing now. You put all that work into farming up a pile of resources you might just lose all of if you are unlucky. This game is designed to take all of your time to play optimally and then spit it back in your face to try and get you to pay. The entire loot cycle is just time consuming and the game has no respect for your time. Their only interest is your wallet. They get you hooked early on with how easy it is, how much power you gain, then they stick it to you hard and its honestly predatory.\\n\\nSo do I recommend this game? Its a great game. I loved every minute of my time here, even the story (I dont think its as bad as some would lead you to believe) BUT this is an MMO. A game genera designed to get you invested and keep you their long term. With how loot upgrades works...I just cant bring myself to recommend the game. Its good, ill always play it casually but this will never be a \"Main MMO\" just simply because I dislike wasting my time and this game will shit all over your time and kick you in the ass until your credit card falls out.',\n",

While annoying, they have no impact on how well made the actual game is. If you're here to give a negative review for this, don't. Blame Amazon, don't punish the devs. \\n\\nI haven't played for too long yet, but I'm confident in the quality of this video game. You should play it too. The combat feels great, the 1-50 grind feels manageable, and I hear amazing things about the endgame. My only gripe is with the story - it is completely nonsensical and very skippable (my opinion, obvs. Some folks seem to like it.)\\n\\nAnyway, try the game. It's been unfairly review-bombed and that sucks. I think it's pretty good.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'First, My playing hours are like x2 because I also played a lot of houres outside steam.\\nI am a rank 100 and play all the factions.  I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.\\n\\nIt is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.\\nAfter so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin\\'s enemy.\\n\\nThere are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:\\n\\n1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).\\nNow the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)\\n\\n2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.\\n\\n3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.\\nBut I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.\\n\\n\\nThere are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. \\n\\nBut i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. \\nWarthunder \"can\"  become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.',\n",

       "  'developer_response': \"1. Yes, that is important part of good gameplay - the ability to find game quick enough.  But we are avoiding 'impossible to kill vehicle' - so basically you can meet more powerful vehicle than yours but there is a way to kill it anyway.\\n\\n2. All this is misinformation.\\n'There is no cheats' was never stated at all. This is part of phrase, switched out of context, from 2013, when there were ONLY TWO game modes - Plane Arcade Battles and Plane Realistic Battles (bot modes are planes only and with markers - so there is no maphack). And full statement was something like 'there is no such cheats in the game like speedhack or invulnerability or kill-all'. \\nMoreoever - those days there were no (at least known!) _working_ cheats at all!\\nALL so-called cheats were those days just malware. And the statement was perfectly clear and correct.\\nThis statement IS CORRECT even nowdays, but with tank battles (especially realistc battles) there are possibility to have maphack or aimbot.\\nWhen RB tank battles appeared WE IMMEDIATELY started work on anticheat solutions, cause hiding marks on tanks in client of course can be bypassed by cheaters - 'nevert trust client' is basics of multiplayer code.\\nAbout 'banning youtuber' - that is also incorrect. That was bad story, when one of our former employees overreact on one youtuber behavior (while youtuber was viloiting public agreement and EULA, btw). The problem was solved and videos restored in 4 days (youtube guys are slow and couldnt make it faster, while we ask them the same day). We apologize for that and perform some more actions and in a good relationship with that youtuber for long time since that.\\nThere issue has nothing in common with cheaters.\\n3. MOST of our work is fixing bugs and working on community reports and feedback.\\nHowever most of players do not understand that there are LOTS of players with DIFFERENT feedback. We have implemented features of years of manwork (for example so called LastManStading) by users suggestions and than remove them from the game by users feedback. Of course, there were different users - those who suggest and those who protest.\\nUser often think that his playstyle and feedback is common and all agree with it, but thats really not that often true.\\nWe have 15th game modes that can be treated as different games (tanks, planes, ship, realistica, arcade, simulator, and moreover - jets, bombers, fighters, assault planes, tank destroyers, tanks, rocket tanks, ATGM tanks and so on - there are really different) and players usually do not play even 25% of the whole game and do not see all the game and all other players feedback and opinions.\\nThis - game variety (and I'm not talking of content even! But we have hundreds of locations and thousands of vehicles that also matters) - can be treated as a biggest game flaw, and, in the same time, as a biggest game advantage and feature - this is the game where you can fight on almost any military vehicle against almost any possible comparable military vehicle in thousands of environments and situations.\\nI know, looking at amount of time you play the game, that you know and feel at least big part of the game, but almost sure that not all - there are not lots of players that experienced in all game aspects.\"},\n",

       "  'review': 'Okay listen.\\n\\nI\\'ve got 2,222 hours in this game while I\\'m writing this. I get that it\\'s confusing that I\\'m making a negative review.\\n\\nTl;dr: This is a good game, but one of the worst, most scummy products I\\'ve ever seen. One that preys on people with addictive personalities in a wide spectrum of ways.\\n\\nAll I really need to do is explain the monetization tbh:\\n\\n-Silver Lions: Silver lions are the non-premium currency for War Thunder. They are achieved passively just by played, and playing well gives a nice bonus. Winning matches massively multiplies silver lion gains (ie, if you kill 1 person in a match you lose in the planes mode you\\'ll get a small amount of silver lions, but even just one kill in a match you win is worth a fair amount, and to a degree this gets better the better you play). But here\\'s the... well... \"but\". Silver lions are precisely designed so that when you first start playing the game, no matter what (ie, whether you are completely free to play, just have a premium vehicle, or have premium vehicles and a premium account) you will be getting enough silver lions to more than cover the silver lion costs of the vehicles you will have access too. Low tier vehicles cost basically nothing to repair, as do almost all premiums (and premium accounts and vehicles both massively boost silver lion income while using them). You might be seeing the problem already, but if not stick with me here. As you progress through the game, if you\\'re free to play you will at first quickly unlock cheap vehicles before reaching more expensive ones, then things will be slower and slower to unlock and more expensive. To be clear, all of this so far isn\\'t a big deal. The issue comes when you reach about 7.0 (battle rating, which is basically just a \"level\" for matchmaking balance) for ground forces or about 8.0 for air forces, in my experience. At this point vehicles are sluggish to unlock and extremely expensive. Buying them, training a crew slot to play them, and every modification all costs SL, but also repairing and rearming the aircraft after the battle. At the lower tiers you might not even notice this. By about 6.0 you\\'ll almost certainly notice this but unless you play very poorly it won\\'t be a major issue. You might have to take it easy right after buying a newly unlocked vehicle, but other than that you\\'re fine. But beyond that, certain vehicles (seemingly arbitrarily, though there\\'s always a long winded explanation that boils down to \"balance\") cost bafflingly, ridiculously, hilariously high amounts of silver lions. If you have about 2-3 million silver lions at lower tiers, you\\'re golden. You can lose some of it if you have some rough matches, but you\\'ll be fine. At the higher tiers, you could burn through that in a day just by being unlucky. Half the time you unlock a new jet or main battle tank it\\'s so expensive you either can\\'t buy it, or can but then can\\'t play it because if you die before getting a kill you lose massive amounts. \\n\\nSo the question is... why? Why is there vehicles in the game that you are punished for playing? Why is the game designed in such a way that you can progress by grinding for hundreds of hours only to be rewarded by being literally unable to play if you have some rough matches? Well, it sorta brings us to the next monetization, but basically, you can buy Silver lions for real money. If you run out you can pay for more. Now full transparency, this isn\\'t technically pay-to-play. It\\'s more like \"pay-to-easily-play-high-tier\". You\\'re not locked out of playing the game, but if you really want to play high tier modern stuff and don\\'t have silver lions, you\\'re out of luck unless you have amazing matches. Certain vehicles, like the B-29/Tu-4 long range bomber have such a high repair cost, and such a low survival rate that they are essentially useless. Gaijin balances almost exclusively through SL costs. It\\'s awful.\\n\\nSo, next up is Golden Eagles. This is the premium currency. This is nothing new, every F2P game has them pretty much. It\\'s not something I would review a game as negative for normally but Golden Eagles are a small piece of the puzzle. They can be used to buy the majority of the premium vehicles in the game, as well as silver lions, premium account time, decals, decorations, ect. Premium vehicles are often unbalanced on launch but get balanced overtime. I don\\'t know if this is intentional or not but after the IS-6 dominated for over a year Gaijin has toned this down a lot. Still, some are better than others. They\\'re objectively not pay to win, but they are clearly pay to progress. The biggest issue is that new players can pay about the price of a full AAA game for a high-tier vehicle without learning how to use it. The game is loosely designed in such a way so that as you progress you learn the skills you need to progress. It\\'s not super linear but it naturally happens fairly well. But if you can just buy the highest tier stuff with no limitations then you skip the grind, yes, but you also skip the learning. This leads to a lot of very inexperienced players at high tier, who often teamkill, ram, block, capture-point steal, and otherwise ruin the game for what should be the most dedicated part of the playerbase. To be clear I\\'m not strictly against this but there\\'s already so little incentive for team-play in this game that new players with high tier premiums are never actually gonna put in the time to learn how to play like experienced players do. Again, fine, but it\\'s two clashing playstyles that shouldn\\'t ever really meet. Jets and main battle tanks should, in theory, have the most depth and highest skill ceiling in the game but through a mix of map design, mechanics and this aforementioned premium issue, they actually have the least depth aside from the very lowest tiers, and devolve into head-on ramming and head on charges.\\n\\nPremium accounts. Not much to say here. Again, normal for F2P games, but on top of everything above, and everything below, it\\'s a lot. They basically make it so you get more research and silver lions. You progress faster and run out of lions slower. It effects other players in no way, since even if you have a premium account, unless you buy a high tier premium, by the time you get to high tier you\\'ll likely be fairly experienced.\\n\\nConvertible Research. One of the scummiest. Basically you can pay Golden Eagles (real money) to speed up or skip the research of a vehicle. This one just purely prays on frustrated people not thinking clearly who are fed up with the grind. And this game is full to the brim with grind. It is literally endless grind. You will never achieve everything without paying huge sums of real money, but the game loves to tempt you with the fact it\\'s technically possible (until they add the next thing, and they add new vehicles every update more or less). Never, ever ***EVER*** use convertible research unless you have some golden eagles laying around and a bit of research you don\\'t feel like doing. Even then it makes more economic sense to just get premium (vehicles or account). This is a waste of money. Do not use your eagles on this. \\n\\nGaijincoin and the War Thunder Market. Think of the CS:GO or Dota or TF2 marketplaces. It\\'s just that. Turn your money into even faker money which you can\\'t turn back into \"real\" money. There\\'s skins and non-premium but exclusive vehicles on the marketplace. Almost all are event vehicles that required immense grind to get. A few of them are outright overpowered, like the KV-220, and thus go for hundreds and hundreds of dollars. A lot of the cheap skins on here are great though and a portion of the money goes to the artist so it\\'s not the worst thing ever. You can get some of this stuff for free easily. Again, this isn\\'t on its own that big of a deal, but keep in your mind that all of this is in *one* game.\\n\\nThere\\'s also a battlepass (Like Dota, Overwatch, Smite ect.).\\n\\nBasically: Every element of this game is designed to squeeze money out of you.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Oh how I wish i could call an arty strike on Gaijin\\'s head office.\\n\\nLet me list the most frustrating aspects of this game:\\nA bit of a lengthy review but if you are really interested in this game then you should at least skim this review to get an idea of what you\\'re signing up for. Also the first serious review I\\'ve done of a game but I have been playing this for 4 years now and it\\'s about time I told (warned) people about it.\\n\\nThe devs:\\nHas never listened to it\\'s community\\'s suggestions or bug reports. The closest we ever got was when everyone, including the largest Youtuber Phlydaily was pushing to have parts and fire extinguishers to come for free with every vehicle, instead of making it a module to research (or spend money on). So if you get shot in the transmission, yup you cant move the rest of the match, or get shot in the barrel? Yup, you are completely useless unless you can make it to a cap point which sometimes there is only 1. Guess what... they said \"no\" and have since never acknowledged community suggestions since then due to the horrible PR fallout. They balance the game based off players stats in that particular vehicle. Leaving some vehicles completely broken or overpowered for months while data comes in for them to actually do something about it. Easily the most frustrating of these cases was the fact that the battle rating spread is so compressed from power creep that they couldn\\'t figure out what level to put the Maus at to make it competitive and balanced so they just removed it from the game. LOL yeah they barred new players from being able to research it cause they were too lazy to fix their game. They also will gladly make up stats or armor values about tanks to fit their view of what they think it should be capable of. \\n\\nThe grind:\\ndear god the insane grind, if you don\\'t get premium AND a high tier premium vehicle ($80 for a year of premium time and $40-$60 a piece for the vehicles, some of which are also broken - STRV 103-0 - to name one) then it will literally take you 6-12 months to grind out a single nation. So if you are strapped on time to dedicate to gaming, then just pick a nation and stick to it or you won\\'t see anything past tier 3-4 (early world war 2 armored vehicles). It will easily take you a year or more to grind out the top tier jets/tanks of any nation.\\n\\nNew vehicles:\\nAnytime they add a new vehicle or whole nation, which is all the major updates contribute to the game, they generally make it overpowered so people will spend money on getting the \"op vehicles.\" The other portion of new vehicles have some extremely frustrating broken/missing feature that they don\\'t address for months and in most cases years after it being well known to the community. \\n\\nThe maps:\\nOnly 6/38 have protected spawn points, leaving you open to being sniped (sometimes from the enemy spawn) 15 seconds after spawning. There are countless \"unintended\" spots that completely break the map allowing you to see the entire battlefield while also being immune to fire if you have a strong turret (they tried to fix this but failed.) Horrible design flaws continue with layouts that, in combination with game modes, make tanks designed for hull down and defensive game play completely worthless because you HAVE to push to the objective to cap and win. Oh that\\'s right there is 1 single type of game mode: domination, where you have to push to the middle of the map and cap a point, sometimes there\\'s 1 2 or 3. Yup that\\'s all we get for variation in game play across all types (sim/realistic/arcade). Also since they added thermal sights and night vision devices, every 10th game you get is a night battle. Ya and it can take a week or two w/o premium time to grind out the modules that allow for this. Especially for night battles but also generally most people just leave the match  after 1 death. This is only a problem for the higher tiers though, made worse by top tier premiums making for many players to not have lineups to  have a proper ability to fight and finish a match. The worst offenses for Gaijin\\'s inability to make viable maps is that they give you city maps that measure 1km from your spawn to enemy spawn in modern MBT\\'s... As well as very poorly thought out maps that encourage players to go straight to the enemy spawn and spawn camp instead of trying to navigate/fight in their confusing layouts that make no sense from a gameplay perspective but \"are accurate to a real life location.\"\\n\\nHelicopters:\\nTwo words- completely broken. Damage models allow for a helicopter to shrug off 120mm APFSDS rounds through the entire length of the heli unless you precisely hit the pilot, and a lot of the time immune to even direct hits from SAMs and ATGMs. Even hitting the engine and causing a fire won\\'t cause it to crash; only gently begin losing altitude all the while spamming hydra rockets at you, which auto-kill you if you\\'re in a light tank/anti-aircraft. They don\\'t even have their own (functioning) game mode meaning you\\'re forced to use them in ground battles to grind out the later heli\\'s. Which by-the-way require an EXTREME amount of grinding to get to the top of the line, OR as the developers likely intended: just buy your way to. For example, I\\'m grinding the German line with the BO 105 CB-2: I have 50 kills and 32 battles in a PREMIUM heli with premium time and I\\'m not even a 5th of the way through the first heli to research. 40k/170k RP (research points) and then there\\'s 3 more after that (requiring an additional 1.2 MILLION RP+4 million silver lions) when you finally get the most OP/actually good heli for Germany. which gets 8 fire and forget missiles that allow you to raze entire flanks/teams within a minute if left unchecked. Did I mention only about a third of battles in ground mode actually will net you enough spawn points to even take one out with AGMs and not just dumb fire rockets. This coupled with the aforementioned horrible map designs, leading to many many games being throwaways, make it nearly impossible without spending money to achieve the top tier heli\\'s. \\n\\nAir realistic battles: \\nhave 1 single game mode variant and it hasn\\'t changed at all since it\\'s introduction to the game back in 2011. It\\'s fun but it takes 1-5 minutes in loading queue to find a game then it takes anywhere from 3-6 more minutes to actually see combat. Also it doesn\\'t really have any use for bombers of any kind, AKA they are irrelevant to winning the game except for literally 2 bombers in the whole game that can actually win the match if they\\'re ignored - B-29 and TU-4. You can\\'t respawn either in this mode so if you spent 7-10 minutes climbing to altitude trying to catch a bomber, only to have them shoot you in the engine then guess what: you have to fly back to your airfield and repair and if the match ends by the time you are capable again you receive nothing for your effort. At which point you just spent 20 minutes waiting for a game, then just flying around climbing/running/cursing.\\n\\n\\nIt reminds me of good old Battlefield 2/3 when there was mass war with helis/planes and tanks all duking it out for victory. \\n\\nGame modes: \\n\\nRealistic mode, a majority of players -including myself- play this, there aren\\'t enemy markers unless they are hit with any type of munition, which pings a red icon on the mini-map. No assist to aiming and allows for sneaky plays at the cost of also being chop liver for aircraft which are constantly a headache and only require 2-3 kills. AA is cheap to respawn in but some nations get excellent AA while others don\\'t even have any for certain BR\\'s (battle ratings). A massive problem with aircraft being so easily available is the all too common revenge bombing, usually involving the enemy just flying directly into the ground on top of you dropping their bombs a second before death - usually also having enough points again to spawn into a light/medium tank again.\\n\\nI wish I could have my 2000 hours and countless dollars back.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Allow me to preface this by saying I have been playing this game for years and have spent hundreds if not thousands of dollars on this game. Whether on premium currency, buying vehicle packs from the online store or buying premium time. At the time of writing this review I have 240ish days left of Premium time left.\\n\\nI started playing just before they released Ground Forces. The game started out very fun and engaging, but now 1500 hours later I see the game for what Gaijin have turned it into. They turned a fun game, albeit with a heavy dose of grinding, into one of the least fun games I have played in a long time.\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n1. It looks great when maxed out graphically.\\n2. The variety of vehicles is amazing. (caveat about this later). There are manyt different nations to play as.\\n3. Netcode, while not the best I've seen, is very passable for a Free to Play title, with only minor hiccups throughout my time.\\n4. Bugs and glitches, they definitely exist but they did not hinder my gameplay to the point where I would complain about them.\\n5. Cross play with either Xbox or PS4, but not with both simultaneously.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n1. Economy, whether for Silver Lions (SL) to purchase things you've unlocked, or Research Points (RP) to actually unlock them, is a slog. It has been only getting worse as time goes by. It can take ages to unlock the ability to purchase a new vehicle(topping out at just shy of 400 thousand RP), let alone have the Silver to actually purchase the vehicle (upwards of 2 million) and then pay to put a crew in the vehicle (2-3 hundred thousand). Keeping in mind, without paying for premium account, you may only get 500-1500 RP and 10-20 thousand SL per match, which can take anywhere from 5-35 minutes.\\n\\n2. Premium currency is very expensive, and some of the best and most unique vehicles can only be obtained by purchasing Gaijins premium currency, Golden Eagles(GE). There are alternate ways to getting it besides buying it, as I have heard that certain apps will allow you to accumulate GE over time, but I did not use them myself. There is a secondary currency that they use called Gaijin coins that are 1:1 with USD, which is used in the marketplace they created.\\n\\n3. The Marketplace. I hate it. Vehicles sell for hundreds or thousands of dollars, it completely changed the way the game felt once it was introduced. It's just like CS:GO skins, only its not just skins. Imagine if you had to buy the AK-47 in CS:GO for $700 before you could use it.\\n\\n4. The balancing is probably the worst offender in the reason for this review. Gaijin has shown over the years that they do not intend to balance the game, going so far as planning on removing vehicles because they would be to hard to think of a way to balance them. Standard M.O. for Gaijin is to release one or two shiny new vehicles that are overpowered for one to two out of the seven in game nations, wait for everyone to spend money getting to those vehicles and then once the novelty has worn off for players, do it again. It is never a level playing field for every nation. One country gets something that completely outclasses every other nation, every patch. I'm tired of it and its not fun.\\n\\n\\nI could absolutely write more about the game, but I really don't want to give it any more time. Can you have fun with this game? Yeah, sure, but you probably used to play with dirt when you were a kid and thought it was great too.\\n\\nFinal Rating:\\n\\nJust watch a Youtube WW2 documentary / 10\",\n",

       "  'review': 'TL;DR: Gaijin is greedy.\\n\\nI have never seen such oppressive monetisation practices in any other game. \\n\\nFirstly, let\\'s talk about repair costs. When your vehicle is damaged or outright destroyed, you will be charged a fee that is paid for with silver lions--the virtual currency you use to purchase vehicles and upgrades. The amount you pay will depend on a number of factors such as how upgraded your vehicle is or the type of vehicle it is itself. The issue is how nonsensical these costs are and how Gaijin determine them. Gaijin claims the costs are for balancing, which is not only misleading, but lying to the entire community.  It is about profit, nothing more. Silver lions can be purchased with real money and the amount awarded after each match can be so little, or even negative, that players are enticed to spend money just to afford the new vehicle they spend hours grinding for. Players can lose up to 50,000 silver lions per match if they don\\'t perform well, and that isn\\'t always the fault of skill; it is a lot of the time down to poor game design. We will get to that soon.\\n\\nNow let\\'s discuss the effect the hostile microtransaction system has on gameplay, because it is horrendous. A massive percentage of players are terrified of dying and then paying excessive repair costs for that vehicle. In ground battles, I recall many instances where 90% of my team would be encamped upon a hill and remain there for the entire match because they didn\\'t want to take the risk of moving across the open field just to get destroyed without getting any score and then incurring the wrath of repair costs. My playstyle can best be described as an aggressive brawler, so when I decide to push and battle over the objective, I will be doing so with only one or two teammates--sometimes none. Gaijin punishes players for losing but at the same time punishes players for taking risks, which seriously hampers gameplay. Players no longer work as a team, they only care about themselves and how many silver lions they will make in a battle.\\n\\nAnother huge flaw with this game is the map design. This is primarily an issue with ground battles for obvious reasons. Gaijin have chosen the \"form over function\" route where you make a pretty map first and work out where everything will go later. These maps are so broken and flawed to the point where your entire team can be spawn camped from the other side of the map. The battle then becomes so one sided due to players, again, not wanting to risk spawning anything to avoid having to pay for the repair costs of dying five seconds in. This causes a spiral effect where teams will rarely make a comeback, as half of the players in said team have understandably returned to the hangar to avoid those repair costs. The newest ground map, Red Desert, has made a lot of good design decisions, primarily with a mostly symmetrical layout. It still isn\\'t perfect, however. Fortunately, you can ban maps from your matchmaking. You\\'ll be paying Gaijin money to do that, of course.\\n\\n\\nOne of the issues with the game\\'s development is the community itself. There are two vocal minorities; the die-hard \"This game is perfect!\" apologists and the \"Frak you, Gaijin!\" toxic man-babies. The apologists appear to be in complete denial regarding any issue that players start discussing, I assume due to the amount of money they have spent on the game, which is an amazing case of Stockholm Syndrome. On the other side, you have the toxic man-babies who just want something to be mad about. An example of this would be a recent update where Gaijin actually lowered the insane repair costs for some vehicles, but these people reacted so negatively to seeing \"economic changes\" without knowing what actually changed, that their outrage seems to have panicked the developers into reverting those changes very quickly.\\n\\nGaijin has demonstrated very little respect for it\\'s community and have done the complete opposite of what creative director Kirill Yudintsev stated in 2014:\\n\"Players happiness about the game (not about us [Gaijin]) is our main prioirty[sic]. We are making changes in the game since its official release based ONLY on players feedback or ideas how[sic] to make game better for them.\"\\n\\nThe only reason War Thunder is popular and successful is because it is unique. There is currently no other competitor that offers a similar experience of realism and variety in vehicles and gameplay. Once a similar game is created and not looked at like a bag of money by those developers, where do you think players will go? Gaijin is out of touch with not only their own game, but their community too. It\\'s an incredible game ruined by greed.\\n\\nI have been playing War Thunder since 2014 and have spent more money on it than I would like to admit. I have never been vocal about the game, nor do I rarely ever leave reviews, but they really are going too far.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Oh boy, War Thunder. After playing the game a little I wish I could give it a neutral review, but as of the current direction the game is taking I will leave it as a negative one.\\n\\nThe game itself is fun. It's free, so try for yourself. The main issues the game has begin showing once you reach the endgame grind. e.g. Tier V+. The grind has been getting worse and worse, especially without a premium account and vehicles. Not only in research, but also in purchase and running costs. \\nGaijin attempts to balance things by increasing repair costs, which does not really change the balance, but just makes it impossible to play certain vehicles, such as Bombers, for prolonged periods of time with any sort of profit. As a 100% free player, if the unlocking of vehicles doesn't bring you to a halt, then making enough money to actually play them will do the trick. \\n\\nIt's quite a shame because under all the grinding and money sinks, War Thunder is a fun game that has taken a turn in the wrong direction. Not into a Pay 2 Win, but in a painfully slow grindfest which fails to reward players properly for their performance in matches.\\n\\nThe worst offender in recent years though, has been the Gaijin market. What started out as a neat little idea similiar to the Steam Marketplace, the gaijin market moved away from a community content driven store, where players could sell their vehicle camos and profit, to a more intrusive model, selling parts for construction events and trying to squeeze as much money out of it as possible. \\n\\nI only want the best for the game, hell, in my over 3000 hours I spent at least 200-300€ on the game and without regret. It is free so whoever is interested should definetly give it a go and check it out, but if you expect to play it entirely for free, you will be in for a long grind with little reward.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"War Thunder is one of those games where you really, REALLY want to love it, but the game does everything in it's power to make you absolutely hate it.\\n\\nThis game has one of the most intricate combat systems ever put into a vehicle-based game, a massive roster of lovingly detailed military vehicles recreated with as much care and accuracy as possible, across land, sea and air and pretty decent graphics and effects that help bring the intensity of the clashes between war machines to life.\\n\\nHowever, War Thunder also has terrible monetization, featuring premium account time, paid currency, premium vehicles, loot boxes and a player marketplace based on, but separated from, the Steam one. The game suffers from poor balancing when it comes to it's vehicles, an awful New Player Experience, tons of powerful or simply unique vehicles being only obtainable at certain points in time or during certain events, locking them out from the majority of the playerbase to an even greater degree than premium vehicles, an economy designed to ensure players will lose money through vehicle repair costs, constant power creep through new updates adding more higher-tier vehicles, absolutely horrible grind that requires months of play to reach the higher tiers and that has not been balanced to account for all the new vehicles added with even higher costs, shoddy matchmaking that sees nothing wrong with pitting a team of newbies against one of highly experienced players and then punishing the newbies for their loss, limited gamemode options with the only PVE option being a lazy horde defense mode and a half-baked anti-ragequitting system that ends up punishing players for accidental suicides or causes outside of their control, such as lost connections and crashes.\\n\\nIf you are just an average joe, looking for a fun game to spend some time with, don't bother with this. Unless you are a fan of military vehicles this game will not appeal to you. If you are a fan of those, then you might be able to tolerate the game's awfulness just for it's subject matter. Try it for a few days and, if it doesn't click, drop it.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'As a player who\\'s been playing since the beginning of Raining Fire (released September 2020) I\\'m proud and disappointed at the same time of this game.\\n\\nWhen I first started playing, my dreams weren\\'t focused on the F-4E or MiG-21 variants. I stuck to the US tech tree, and the thought of just strafing ground targets in a SBD-3 as you fly low to the ground was neverending fun for me. I wasn\\'t trying to go grind for top tier jets, I just wanted to have fun with what I had.\\n\\nNew Power came (November 2020) and I think that\\'s where this game started to go downhill. New premium jets were being added alongside standard jets, and, as time went on, I started to change my mindset to grind for jets. That\\'s where my problems begin.\\n\\nI can applaud the developers for modeling every single aircraft, but i\\'m not happy because of the grind. Youtube channels rumored a F2P player to finish a tech tree within a year - if they were lucky.\\n\\nNow, you may be wondering \"why did he give this game a thumbs up if i was going to talk bad about it?\" \"what went wrong?\" \\n\\nI gave it a thumbs up because it has the potential to be one of the best combat games out there. Thousands of vehicles, a nice community (no-one really complains about losing or anything or ranting about (X) jet from my experience) the developers are working hard in the midst of the pandemic, and more.\\n\\nNow, here\\'s the current problems with War Thunder.\\n1 - The grind is almost unbearable if you have a F2P (Free 2 Play) account\\n\\nI\\'ve tried to grind the US tree with standard planes alone, but that was extremely hard to a point where I felt the need to buy premium vehicles/bonuses/time.\\n\\n\\n2 - The system is designed to pressure you into spending cash\\n\\nAlthough this is classified as a \"con\", the true reason for Gaijin to do this could be because War Thunder is a free game. Because of this, they have to make packs/vehicles/premium currency a thing so that way they can maintain the servers and keep the game alive. Without cash, they can\\'t manage the servers. Without servers, they can\\'t manage the game because the servers can\\'t be used. Without managing the game, War Thunder will slowly die.\\n\\n\\n3 - Vehicles in Rank IV or V and onward tend to have extremely high repair costs, crew trains, research requirements, and high purchase costs\\n\\nIf you managed to grind a rank V vehicle, you still have to play games in order to get enough currency (Silver Lions) for the vehicle purchase. If you have enough, you still have to deal with a Crew Train (doesn\\'t cost as much as purchase) though poor management of currency can lead you to have extremely low amounts of Silver Lions.\\n\\n\\n4 - The game needs to decompress\\n\\nIf you never played the game before and don\\'t know what I mean by this, tanks and aircraft have this system called \"Battle Rating\". They are divided into said battle ratings which fit them best. Currently, the game has stopped at Battle Rating 10.7 for tanks and aircraft (ships at 6.0/6.3). \\n\\nHowever, the problems start when the developers add more modern aircraft, and, if they don\\'t decompress soon, players may have to deal with F-15s (if they ever get added), F-16s, Su-25s, etc as a F-100 who was unlucky enough to get put in a Battle Rating 10.7 game. F-100s were made in the \\'50s. \\nThey could face aircraft made decades after them \\n(all the vehicles mentioned in this portion of the review were made in the 70\\'s except for the F-100)\\n\\n\\n5 - The team needs to advertise their game better\\n\\nIf you don\\'t know what I mean, almost all of the ads shown featuring War Thunder always have a top-tier tank, plane, or helicopter (top-tier in the community means modern-day vehicles or similar). \\nSo imagine someone seeing these ads, saying \"oh what a cool M1 Abrams! i can\\'t wait to download and play with it!\" and then downloading the game and realizing that instead of a M1 Abrams, they get a M3 Stuart, a World War 2 era vehicle. \\nThey then see a M1 in the US tech tree, but come to the realization that they will have to go through hours of struggling, grinding, getting enough currency for the vehicle, only to finally get a M1 Abrams that they will have to use at one of the most dreaded battle ratings of the game.\\n\\n\\nIf the game developers fixed some of the issues here, that would improve the quality of their game by a lot. War Thunder has the true potential of being one of the best combat games out there, but the developers don\\'t seem to be trying to fix the current issues, which, if fixed, could have the game be a lot better and live up to it\\'s old status of being one of the best combat games.\\n\\nWould I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what goes on within. \\nIf you want to stick to \\'low tier\\',  where it\\'s mostly fun (no grind, no high repair costs, etc) you can, and if you want to play this game for the sole purpose of having fun with early World War Two tanks, planes, or ships, this game would be great for you.\\n\\nThat\\'s all I have to say for now about this game.\\n\\nUpdate (5/21/2021):\\nWith Update 2.7 (Red Skies) introduced via trailers and videos from content creators (it\\'s not out just yet), I have taken a look at the dev server streams and saw that they have fixed quite a few things. Thus, I may do a revised review of the game, though not until the game updates to Update 2.7, because we can\\'t judge books by their cover.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[i]Please read before making consideration:[/i]\\n\\nI am friends with a former Senior Mod from the War Thunder forums. According to (that person), the mods actively check these reviews and downvote any of them that have any kind of criticism. Luckily for us, Steam prevents them from just deleting it like they do on their forums. I believe the top review here is negative, which is good despite my review being positive overall. People need to be aware of all the faults in this game, which are as numerous as all the things this game does right. \\n\\nIf you decide to download this game just be aware of the unilateral censorship and active deletion and muting of anyone who offers up criticism (constructive or otherwise) on the forum. They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend. It's not worth the trouble to deal with the mods if you do or say something they deem critical in any way.\\n\\nAll that said - the game itself is very fun. It's the best plane game on the market right now. Not that that says much, but it's something. The tank mechanics are very poor though, but if you don't mind some occasional RNG wackiness, they are a fun time-killer. \\n\\nThanks for reading, happy tanking (and piloting).\\n\\nUpdate: Took a few years off, giving it another shot. Same game mostly, just more monetization.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"extremely frustrating, time consuming and at times even money requiring.\\n\\nThat's how most of the playerbase would describe the game and you can't blame them. It's a terrible game in terms of balance/economy when you get involved in the meta/endgame part. Starting with non existant battle rating decompression leading to unbalanced matches ending with millions of copypasted vehicles in different research trees to make them look fresh and new.\\n\\nTo give someone a better perspective, I've been playing this game since the beta off-steam and this is my review.\\n\\nTiers I-III are relatively easy to grind out, play and enjoy. For all the countries in the game, this  is about 100 hours of solid fun and time to improve at the game, learn the basics and figure out how to fly certain aircraft types, what ammo to use, how to position yourself in a tank, how to climb in realistic battles, how to range your cannon, how to use certain ammo types etc. \\nFor a new player, yes, this is a good source of fun and enjoyment and a must-try for any military fans out there.\\n\\nBut everything above is pain, unlocking modifications for high tier tanks/aircraft to make them competetive and in some cases even viable takes way more and more time and in-game money. RP required and money requirements for new vehicles skyrocket and to top it off, matches get significantly more sweaty with every battle rating increase after you reach tier IV thanks to the absurd amounts of in-game money required for certain vehicles to repair - literally forcing players to actively kill steal / play the risk&reward game - and for someone who is flying their brand new tier IV plane/stock tier IV tank - suffering. \\n\\nThere's a ton of ways to ease off the grind but most of them involve payment through your credit card and others take way too much time to be considered entertaining and this is single handedly the worst part of War Thunder.\\n\\nGive it a try and don't spend your money on it. If you find serious interest, consider getting a premium vehicle/account/talisman and carry on to become a sweaty, salty war thunder redditor and go downvote this review.\\n\\nand just in case someone asks for the ships - yeah, I forgot about them. so did gaijin.\\n\\nedit #1; Lightning is still at 9.7 \\n             helicopters are pay to play\",\n",

       "  'review': 'There should be a support group for players of this game.  I\\'ve heard it said that War Thunder is the game you\\'re almost allowed to have fun with and it\\'s 100% true.  The frustration and emotional damage wrought by War Thunder is a war crime in itself.  You get just enough non-BS matches to keep you hooked while Gaijin panders to select groups just to milk more money from them.\\n\\nEvery vehicle you research just brings you further up the frustration ladder and it doesn\\'t get better until you reach near the top.  Until then?  Well, prepare your hind quarters for an almighty violation.  Unlock a WW2 era tank?  That\\'s ok, you\\'ll be facing Cold War era gear.  Your mighty 1942 heavy tank will be strapped down over and over again by HEAT-FS rounds not developed for 10 years.  Got yourself a brand new, shiny jet?  Don\\'t worry, you\\'ll be fighting other planes outfitted with guided air to air missiles.\\n\\nTo make it even better, you\\'re required to either pay lions (the in game currency) or wait to repair your vehicle.  The costs of those repairs are *supposedly* based on the effectiveness of the vehicle but there are patterns evident that rule that out.  For instance, planes with no guided munitions will cost more than a plane just a step above it that can erase you from existance with nothing more than an afterthought.  But that plane a step above will be half the price.\\n\\nThe game mechanics that sounded so cool when you first read about them?  Just another avenue of frustration.  Volumetric rounds, for instance, are great until they\\'re not.  Theoretically, the rounds have an actual volume, instead of just being the exact pixel you aimed at.  Actually, it\\'s not even that, the exact pixel that Gaijin\\'s screwed up mechanics decided that the round actually went.  That round has volume, but only most of the time.  Sometimes, rounds that should have bounced off due to the armor (if they were truly volumetric) just magically go right through.  \\n\\nWhen you\\'re not dealing with that, you\\'ll be dealing with magic glass that eats every bit of a tank round or pilots being \"knocked out\" with a frequency that defies logic.  Probably 90% of my deaths in a plane are because the pilot was knocked out.  Doesn\\'t matter what kind of maneuvers you\\'re doing or the range you\\'re at.  Gaijin decides the moment that round is fired whether it hits and nothing you do matters in that.  \\n\\nAnd don\\'t even start on the crew levels.  Until you\\'ve nearly maxed them out (a process that *requires* real money, FYI), they\\'re near useless.  Want to turn?  Hope you\\'ve coughed up for the Golden Eagles (currency paid for with real money) to skill them up, otherwise, they\\'ll black out almost instantly.  It gets worse too.  Haven\\'t maxed out that tank crew yet?  Hope you like being killed by invisible tanks hiding behind what amounts to a stick because your crew\\'s spotting skill wasn\\'t high enough.  \\n\\nEvery once in a while though, you\\'ll have a good match.  One where you get paired up with vehicles that are near enough to your own to make it fun and when the almighty RNG-esus smiles upon you, granting your vehicles some semblance of normal performace.  It\\'s just enough to keep you playing but it\\'ll destroy your sanity in the process.',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have played this game since I was first introduced to it by jingles. (Jan, 5 2013) When i first started playing i was in love. It was the only thing I ever did all day. The thought of getting to jet drove me to play for 14 hours at a time. The game was great. Then the updates started to come... At first it was just harder to make money and xp. People hated it but I kind of liked it. Then the BR system came and balance left. Matchmaking had trouble getting fair matches but even that wasnt so bad. Then the russian bias got real. Im not one of those people that complain that I died to X russian plane/tank but after seeing russian tanks and planes survive things that would destroy any other tank it got annoying. (planes putting out fires, t-34s bouncing tiger 2 shots in the side, ext) But even this wasnt what made me quit this game. It's the company. They are absolutly terrible. Constantly censoring anyone with an opinion than dosent match theirs. They threaten to ruin RB if we dont let them attack youtubers that help them by finding cheaters? And even steam isn't safe. They constantly have people downvote any review that is negative. I can forgive russian bias. I can forgive the terrible BR system. I cannot forgive this company for the way they treat their community. To Anton Yudintsev, you made a game that was amazing. I loved it so much and always will. But what you have become as a company will destroy you in the end. Listen to the community, let them help you make the game better. If you do that, this game has a chance to rise back up into greatness.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I can't in good faith recommend this game. The foundation is solid. The historical accuracy, the plane/tank models, the damage model, are all there, great and very realistic. But all of it is ruined by the economy and questionable developer/balance/gameplay choices.\\n\\nThe progress in unlocking and researching new vehicles is very quick and satisfying in rank 1. But by the middle/end of rank 2 of any nation progress will become increasingly slower, and the cost to buy the already researched vehicles grows more and more, so much so that you can barely afford anything at some point. Almost everything costs silver lions, one of the MANY currencies in game, even the ammunition for each vehicle, and if you don't have a premium account, and at a certain point even if you have one, the mission rewards won't be enough to let you play at higher ranks continuously. It's bad, and it ruins the whole experience. \\n\\nThe worst thing is that, when your vehicle gets damaged in a mission, you'll have to pay silver lions to repair it, OR wait several hours or days for it to repair for free. While in the first few ranks the cost is acceptable as you get rewarded way more than that for each mission, as you unlock more expensive vehicles the repair cost will be too much to be sustainable. Which means you'll probably have to wait up to days to play with that same vehicle again.\\n\\nThis creates a vicious psychological cycle. You don't want to be destroyed in a mission or get your vehicle damaged as when that happens you'll most likely become very frustrated.\\n\\nThe more you advance through the vehicle ranks, the more skill and knowledge is also required. Which is kind of fine, if the game was sustained by a fair economic system and didn't have questionable balance and gameplay designs.\\n\\nI have mostly played with air forces throughout my many hours in game. While the arcade game mode feels pretty balanced, the realistic mode is not. I'll make an example about gameplay and balance design choices that I dislike.\\n\\nIn the last few days I was going through rank 2 of the american air force. There's this airplane, the P-51: when you spawn as a fighter in a realistic battle you will have to take off from an airfield, both factions do. The P-51 has one of the worst climb rate in the game in its rank as a fighter. And it's a boom and zoom plane, which means the plane is required to be at a high altitude and have enough energy/speed to be effective. Since both factions airfields are very close to each other, with that plane you won't be able to climb high enough to have the effectiveness that the plane requires. Even if you side climb, the plane will lose effectiveness once you reach 4000 metres of altitude and beyond due to its engine limitation. And by that time the game is probably already decided, meaning you've spent 10-15 minutes climbing without engaging in any fight whatsoever.\\n\\nI have tried to play the plane differently, using it as a low altitude boom and zoomer, or as a turn fighter. If you play as the former, any other plane which has the altitude advantage over you will gun you down, and there will be. If you play as the latter, every fighter will outperform you and kill you, as the plane turn rate is very bad compared to other fighters. Once an enemy fighter has you in its sight, it's game over. This happened over and over again, as frustration mounted I felt helpless, the plane was basically unplayable. Its only usefulness, then, was to use it as a bomber killer, as at least its guns are formidable: but since most bombers at rank 2-3 will stay at a altitude higher than 4000 metres, getting to them will be hard and still take quite some time\\n\\nThis is just one of a few examples I could make. Bombers effectiveness is also questionable at best, as most fighters will gun you down at some point during a match. That is more a question of when, not if.\\n\\nThe game also has several single player modes that you could play. Some are free, dynamic campaigns is one them, some are not, the Pacific campaigns, which, from what I've read, they were last updated so long ago that some missions have become unplayable over time, as patches have changed the game and the specifics of each plane.\\nI like dynamic campaigns though: but again, Gaijin doesn't care about them. Some missions are almost impossible to win. They also have a daily limit, which means the rewards get scaled so much after you've completed a couple that you won't be able to get any research points nor silver lions by completing them. Developers want you to play online, not some unfinished single player mode they don't care about.\\n\\nDo yourself a favour and don't play this game. You may get sucked into it, because as I said the foundations are all good and there, but over time you will realize you're mostly getting frustration out of it and you're wasting your time as the economics is completely rigged and want you to spend money on every turn.\\n\\nI almost forgot to mention, after the war in Ukraine the developers decided to remove the chat, making coordination with teammates that much harder. It's been disabled for more than a month now and who knows when it will be back.\\nGo figure\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I started playing this game in 2013, and I've put 2,000+ hours into it. I guess I should give a review. \\n\\nDisclaimer. I am now permanently devoiced in game. When I started in 2013 I was a foulmouthed teenager, and over the course of these 7 years my game chat really didn't change too much. I just began pairing my decreasing opinion of the game with my inappropriate language. I rightfully bare the burden of my permanent devoice.I do not hold anything against the gamemasters or mods for their enforcement of gamechat policy.\\n\\nTo begin, Warthunder had the potential to be the best, most historically accurate and fun arcade style flight simulator/shooter on the market.... because it the only game of its caliber on the market. \\n\\nThe grind until you give up and buy a premium account pay2win currency system is great, but its not for me. I would have rather payed $60 from the start and had complete game. I reached top tier jets years ago, sometime around 2014-2015, and I found that jet combat was the most fun to me, and so I mainly played jets. Gaijin has again and again added a response to counter response of new jets that stomp the previous additions, all in hopes that you will get frustrated enough to buy the newest planes outright. Is it possible to play the game without a premium account or buying planes? Yes. Is it more frustrating without paying to win? Also yes. \\n\\nThe community is nothing but fun. The players all collectively hate our developer overlords for the fat cat money grabbing swindlers they really are.\\n\\nIts 2020. My life has changed, and Warthunder has too. But continuously facing suspiciously biased planes and weapons, while other factions face a significant disadvantage isn't right. You can't make a game focusing on the military marvels of each country, but make the competitive multiplayer a one sided and unbalanced fight without people feeling like they are facing a Russian bias from a Russian developer.\\n\\nEventually a new game will come along where the developers will actively listen to the community, make changes based on feedback and not in the name of pure profit. I will happily shell out my money when that game comes.\\n\\nUnfair balancing, blatant Russian biases and favoritism, and pay2win scheming developers aside, the content of the game is fantastic. There is nothing more satisfying than breaking the sound barrier a treetop level. Facing the skilled tactics equally as good or better pilots, using team tactics - the gameplay itself is wonderful and you should at least try it once. If you look too deep into the game you will eventually start to see the ugly underbelly. So don't look. \\n\\nI've set the cogs in motion to suspend and delete my account. I almost feel like its been an abusive relationship that I couldn't quit. I've deleted the game from my PC probably a dozen times, but I reinstall and get dragged right back in. I like this game, but I am not going to take the abuse from Gaijin anymore. \\n\\nGoodbye Warthunder. Its been one hell of a flight.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I quit this game months ago and it was the best decision I ever made. I am only choosing to review this game now because originally, I did not want it to come from a place of anger. After I quit War Thunder I bought myself a nice flight stick and throttle, downloaded a popular military flight sim and bought a few high-fidelity planes, and learned how to really fly a plane and it’s been a blast! \\n\\nNow that I have moved on and no longer harbor hate for War Thunder, I am going to tell you what can happen if you download this game. Now you might not have money to spend, or maybe you do but you are special, but chances are you are like most of us, you aren't special, you are average, and you work and you play games for fun when you are done working. If that is the case there is a good chance  you will end up like many of the countless players that are caught in this never-ending loop that Gaijin intends to keep you in, grinding every minute or dollar they can out of you until you finally break. If you are lucky this happens early on, if not it happens thousands of hours and dollars later. \\n\\nI  got out just shy of 800 hours and I'm thankful of that.  I am not sure if there are any other reviews like this on steam nor do I care which is why I turned off comments. I believe the truth is a huge percentage of people get burned by these types of games but few are willing to admit it publicly.  Any public discussion about this will have trolls and git gud comments, but the truth is you can't get good at a game that is rigged against you.\\n\\nThose of us with disposable income aren't generally stupid, we know that spending real dollars for pixels  is foolish but we also know what we earn in one hour working versus grinding hundreds of hours for one plane. Those that would rather pretend they are too smart to fall for this model, or that they have grinded every vehicle they own, while they secretly pay, are part of why companies like Gaijin make so much money. \\n\\nWhen you first start playing you are supposed to be blown away by the beauty of the planes and the freedom of flying around. You should be excited that you can point your mouse where you want your plane to go. Wow, the freedom and simplicity of flight! Your first few rounds will be amazing, you'll be killing planes left and right with a crappy WW1 Biplane that can turn on a dime. You probably won’t even realize you are fighting bots but it will be an absolute blast.\\n\\nAs you move up the tiers you will unlock more planes (or other vehicles) and probably get pretty hooked as your hard work is rewarded with exciting new vehicles.\\n\\nWow, a free-to-play game that’s so much fun and all these free vehicles?!!? Amazing right? WRONG. IT IS A TRAP. If you don't read any further just know that you must run, save your time, your money, who knows what else, your job, your relationships? JUST RUN. \\n\\nOK if you are still here let me explain. The game will start as a fun and rewarding experience so that you quickly become hooked. As you progress the grind becomes longer and harder and so does the game. If Gaijin gets its way and you have that kind of personality that many of us do, you will start playing the game every moment you’re not working. The harder it is the more driven you are to rise to the challenge! \\n\\nThe harder you work the higher you rank and your progress slows to the point that you feel compelled to maintain the forward momentum you had earlier so you sign up for a premium account because it will increase your leveling efficiency significantly. Eventually, that slows down too, but now you can’t even imagine not having a premium account.  \\n\\nNow you are in the higher tiers too so you’re getting killed left and right. You start feeling like you need to get good, and skill is the only issue. You think if you just practice enough and git gud you'll start killing everyone. \\n\\nBut no matter how much research or practice or tweaks you make the consistency just isn't there.  You will have some good rounds, sometimes even great rounds, once in a blue moon you might have 5 or 6 awesome matches in a row and you'll get your adrenaline rushes! But it won’t last, inexplicably you'll start to have terrible rounds eventually, no matter what, literally shooting planes and the bullets do nothing. Some will say it's lag even though you have an insanely fast connection, some will say you need to get better, change your gun sites, vehicle settings, or tweak your video settings to low to cheat (especially for tanks) but it's all just a scam. \\n\\nIt doesn't matter how much practice, or time you spend, or money, or what vehicle you use, the game is designed to trap you in an endless miserable loop of grinding, and paying, for small rewards, accepting unfair nerfs on your already unlocked vehicles and getting back to the grind for whatever the flavor of the week vehicle is next.\\n\\nThis loop will frustrate you after whatever combination of time/money you invested and you will think you need to take decisive action to get out of this loop now! Time to double down! You have invested way too much time; you need to start winning consistently, you deserve it! You need a better vehicle and to focus more and work harder to start winning consistently, right?? Time to push harder than ever now, oooohhh your so close to the next plane, you will kick ass consistently when you have that plane. Oh well you have the plane but you need the better engine, or the missiles unlocked, or the airframe upgrades. OH but the grind is SOOO long. Ok your just going to spend some premium currency to speed leveling stuff up because you need a better plane to compete. \\n\\nHmm you know what? These free planes are no good. You need to buy few nice premium vehicles because everyone around you is telling you that you need them, or you’re getting killed by them constantly, that must be the advantage, right? Ill buy this plane for 50 bucks. Oh I need a good tank, oh and a good AA vehicle. Oh I only have these for allied teams I need them for Axis too.\\n\\nJUST STOP.  The truth is that if a vehicle exists that will give you an advantage it will likely be nerfed right after Gaijin has determined enough people have spent money to unlock it whether it be with real money or premium currency. If you can grind it out and it is a great vehicle and you don’t spend money to acquire this vehicle by the time you finally earn it, it will likely be brutally nerfed. I believe the intention is so that the next time a new powerful vehicle arrives you will immediately pay to unlock it just so you can enjoy it before it gets nerfed. \\n\\nIf you start playing despite my warning in this review, there are only 2 ways this is going to end 1. You hate the game but can't stop because you have invested too much time, money, and given up so much in real life that you feel trapped. After all, quitting is admitting you are a jackass and now you must play until either you or the game dies.\\n\\n 2. You do what I did and just walk away and let it go because you were a jackass but that’s ok all you can do is learn from your mistakes or simply repeat them. \\n\\nIf you are caught in this loop, the best advice I can give you is to simply stop logging in and free yourself of the bullshit. \\n\\nIn closing, while I no longer harbor hate for them, I do believe the people that develop and run this game are truly evil.  Unfortunately, they are being rewarded for their greed and their disgusting tactics are encouraged by the very people they take advantage of. \\n\\nWhile I feel free to play has its place when executed without malice, pay to win must end. I think it is time for players with incomes to band together and start refusing to download pay to win games and bring about the much-needed death of an evil business model or the future of gaming will be a grim one.\",\n",

       "  'review': '\\tWar Thunder is an amazing game that revolutionizes many parts of the gaming industry, from small quality of life features such as tow cables to its massive scope from the interwar period to the modern day. However, this creates another problem: War Thunder is a monopoly of a game, and Gaijin, the company that develops the game, treats it as such.\\n\\tWar Thunder is the only game in existence that offers what it does, so if a player wants something that War Thunder gives, they have to go through War Thunder, a game which suffers from dozens of tiny cuts of annoyance that drive old players to leave, and Gaijin makes its money off of constant transplants of new players paying money to get some of the action themselves.\\n\\tGo to any prominent War Thunder YouTuber and they alone will have over a dozen videos detailing individual problems with the game, and how the whole community gives feedback on so many issues only to fall upon deaf ears, or at least ears that don’t seem to care for determining which is good feedback and which is malicious.\\n\\tAnything from the gameplay being unbalanced, to the grind involving over a year of dedicated work, to other small problems, contrasted with the ever-increasing number of late-game and premium vehicles that are increasingly unbalanced in the matchmaking algorithm and much harder to get in the first place, show Gaijin’s lack of genuine care for making the game one worth playing for fun.\\n\\tSince it is a free-to-play game, I don’t want to stop you from playing in the first place, but I beg you, do not pay any money. Support YouTubers and Twitch streamers and other content creators that bring up problems with the game, and see for yourself what War Thunder truly is. Not only for your sake, but for the sake of the whole War Thunder community, which continues to be supported by transplants of new players such as yourself as old players bleed from open wounds that Gaijin does not bandage.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Just to give you an insight of the company that runs this game, Gaijin Entertainment:\\nSome months ago the incredibly unsuccessful E100 tournament took place.\\nPlayers where hyped like ****, A FREAKING E100 IS BEING ADDED\\nWhat people didnt know was that the E100 would only be available to less than 1200 people that won these tournaments, for which you needed to pay to get tickets to play.\\nThe tournament was badly set up and full of hackers (Shhh Gaijin doesnt want us to know there are hackers)\\nOf course thousands of people complained in the forums, including myself.\\nMost of my comments where removed on the context of ''flaming'', some of those comments complained about the removals.\\nShortly after this, they introduced a rule that didnt allow people to post in the forums, unless they had played a certain number of battles prior to posting.\\nAfter receiving a warning for challenging moderation (lol) I got a message from a fellow forum user:\\n''The rule came about shortly after they removed Simulator Battles from the game.  It wasn't to keep the trolls at a minimum, it was to reduce the workload of the moderators after such a poor decision.\\n\\nScarper and Pacifica (two senior mods) are megalomaniacs.   Their egos get in the way of moderation.  Their extra comments on closed threads are often insulting and almost always condescending.  They show the community no respect at all and I believe it is only a symptom of Gaijin policy.  This was evident in the Youtube incident (if you are familiar I won't elaborate, but if you want to know more I'll elucidate)''\\nMore into this:\\nhttp://forum.warthunder.com/index.php?/topic/290640-community-relations-or-why-i-have-to-post-in-off-topic-discussions/\\nhttp://ritastatusreport.blogspot.com/2015/07/gaijin-shuts-down-youtubers-channel.html\\nhttp://www.polygon.com/2015/7/30/9068059/rogue-employee-holds-independent-youtube-channel-hostage-war-thunder\\n\\nMods from all around the globe are likely to downvote this, and I doubt this review will ever be viewed by many, but please, stay away from this toxic company while you can.\",\n",

Even though it only says i have 190 hours, I have closer to 4000 spread over a few accounts.\\n\\nA few years back, I would have given this game the biggest thumbs up that could possibly be received. I loved it, I played it day in day out. It was my favourite game and will likely hold that spot in my heart for a long time to come.\\n\\nHowever, recently, Gaijin has been taking some steps towards monetization in what is arguably the most scummy and \"fuck you\" method to the playerbase that I have ever seen in the gaming industry (yes, worse than EA).\\n\\nNot only that, but they seem to not care about the opinions of the player base, but continue to appeal to the wallet warriors only, as seen when they refuse to fix bugs that have been in the game for years, but continue to add copy past planes for 60 USD (see all F-5 variants). The core elements of the game that used to be fun have been ruined. Their continuining desire to add new things to please the wallet warriors has led to planes that have that been in the game since the beginning such as the Me 262 getting its shit kicked in as it has to face jets that are as old compared to it as you to your parents.\\nThey\\'re totally disconnected from the community, and currently, they are trying to implement more shitty features like adding an expiration date to items that we the players have been collecting over the years? Why is this important you may ask? Because the only way to get these is to get them from loot boxes that you have to buy and they\\'re trying to get us to do that :(\\n\\nI really love this game, no other game feels like this one does, but i cannot in good faith recommend it to you at this point in time.

       "  'review': \"Let's take a closer look at the peculiar case of War Thunder...\\n\\nPros:\\n\\n+ Gameplay. War Thunder combines an arcade-like playstyle with an ultra realistic damage model, every player can find something for himself here. You can hop in for a quick and casual match, or you can be all tactical and competitive.\\n\\n+ Variety. Arguably the game's main selling point, the number of historical and modern vehicles is staggering. War Thunder offers hundreds of armored cars, light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, fighters, bombers, attack helicopters, motorboats, battleships and many more... all of that spread across multiple nations with their own quirks and different playstyles.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n- Matchmaking. Easily the single worst thing about this game. Each vehicle is given an arbitrary Battle Rating value and should only face similarily rated vehicles. At first glance this sounds fair, unfortunately it isn't. The entire BR range is way too compressed, and BR values are based on the averaged global statistics instead of the vehicle's true capabilities. This leads to completely absurd situations, such as late WW2 heavy tanks facing early MBTs with stabilized guns and HEATFS shells - ruining the experience for both.\\n\\n- Economy. Over the years Gaijin has been slowly tightening and rigging the game's economy. All kinds of battle rewards and multipliers have been slowly lowered or removed. The game is now at a point where you can no longer grind towards Rank IV or V without a premium account. You may even no longer be able to play some of your favourite vehicles because the repair costs will ruin you.\\n\\n- Premium vehicles. More and more of them have been added into the game with each subsequent update. Some of those premium vehicles are plain Pay2Win cases while others are abused for their increased rewards and multipliers. This leads to situations where entire BR ranges are dominated by the premium vehicle spam, for example: T-72AV (TURMS-T), KW I C, Ju 288, XP-50 and many more...\\n\\n- Staleness. Despite the variety found in tech trees, almost every other aspect of the game feels incredibly dated and uninspired. Entire game modes have not been touch in years and most new ground maps are poorly designed, half-empty, desert-like battlegrounds with recycled assets.\\n\\nIn conclusion: War Thunder has changed a lot over the years and it's been a downward spiral. It started off as a fun, competitive and semi-historical game which devolved into a weird, grindy and toxic chore. It's problems are now synergizing: bad matchmaking makes the economy issues worse, bad economy forces people to buy premiums, premiums ruin the matchmaking even further. War Thunder could be one of the greatest games out there, instead it choses to be unfun by design.\",\n",

Not a russian bias as in all their tanks are OP. commented below abit more regarding this)\\n* The progression without premium is SUCH a grind its insane, (ofc this is to make players pay for premium) \\n* the \"Rewards\" you get in those...battlepacks, are jsut not worth any, wagers/mission is mostly impossible for 99% of players stuff like \"get first AND last kill\" like are you kidding me? and i gotta do that 10 times? \\n* Maps are made for low/mid tier, when you get high tier often ppl can spawn kill straight from their spawn. \\n* Spawnkilling is INSANE!\\n* Playing tanks and only wanna play tanks? get readuy to be destroyed by planes and helicopters thatll bomb you without you having a chance.\\n\\nThere is ofc way more negatives, and if you look at the \"positive\" reviews you´ll also notice the sentence \"love hate relationship\" is pretty common. Its just NOT a good monitasation model, i woulden´t mind paying for stuff, but its so extremly overpriced and they try to FORCE you to get premium. iv played this game since way before it got added on steam, bc i love the mechanics it has. But gaijin is without a doubt a shitty company that somehow miracoulus got a good game. I hope they will ease up on the cost and also make changes to all their maps. But time has proven to me that they simply won´t do it. \\n\\ni do NOT recommend this for anyone who not absolutly need a new game like WoT genre or such. save your time and money for something els.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game itself is great, but the business model it uses is utter garbage.\\n\\nThe game has beautiful graphics, is very well optimized, gameplay is great, the damage system is the most realistic ever made.\\n\\nBut then the devs business model steps in. They want you to spend money on it, of course that\\'s natural, nobody works for free. But you can\\'t purchase the game. You may purchase only a handful of \"special\" vehicles.\\nIn a regular microtransation game business model, you are forced to grind to have items that you could have by paying extra money. If this is included in a game you already paid, many consider this itself a bad business model that does not respect the player\\'s time and is bad game design. If it\\'s included in a F2P game and the amount of money required to purchase all times by far exceeds the quality of the game and the market\\'s average price, then it\\'s considered pay to win. \\n\\nAnd what Gaijin Entertainment does? They DOUBLE IT DOWN, they make you pay so you can have the \"privilege\" of GRINDING LESS. But you still have to grind in one way or other. And it\\'s no small amount of grind either. See the slug on their company\\'s logo? That\\'s an excellent allegory to the slugish progress you make in this game. After some point of the game, you are not allowed to have bad luck. If you kill less than two or three enemies in a match, you will lose money. If you kill 5 or 6 enemies AND your team wins the game, you MAY gain about 2% or 3% of the money you need to purchase the next vehicle.\\n\\nHere is my current situation for example: I have a Tiger I tank. Every time my Tiger gets destroyed, I lose nearly 2500 to 3000 silver lions to repair it. Killing an enemy gives me around 1000 to 1200 silver lions, and you get about 3000 lions bonus if your brain dead teammates can actually help you to win the match. So I am forced to have a K/D ratio of 3.0 on every game so I can DREAM about buying my desired $170,000 Panther tank someday. After spending about 20 hours this weekend playing this game, keeping a positive K/D on most games I made about 80k lions. In two days of heavily grinding I got barely HALF of what I need to get ONE tank. And I am not even in the MIDDLE of the game, while endgame tanks costs over one million lions, so I can only expect things to get worse unless I start paying HUNDREDS of dollars to get premium currency that will still not grant me access to these vehicles in any way, and will just make things maybe SLIGHTLY easier. Even if killing moer advanced tanks will give me more money, repairing my more advanced tanks will also cost more moneys, which makes the game`s pace not change. So if I ever dream of unlocking all tanks so someday I can play with the Leopard II, I still need to sink 400 hours into this game, or pay the devs about 100 dollars of Premium currency to reduce my grind to \"just\" 200. And that\\'s just one tank segment of one faction.To get access to all tanks in the game it would cost THOUSANDS of dollars plus THOUSANDS of grind hours, or if I wanted to remain not paying anything, maybe 20k hours? Yeah, imagine thinking it\\'s okay to spend more time grinding in a game than you need to get a college degree.\\n\\n\\nLosing is part of every game, but this game punishes you by wasting your time and potentially taking away your money if you were iressponsible enough to spend it on this crap. Everytime I get a lucky kill by accidentaly flanking somebody I feel bad because I probably made somebody\\'s day worse by pushing their progress back and I didn\\'t even feel accomplished.\\nThe entire game is designed around mining your earnings and make you spend money. You need to buy shltty vehicles you don\\'t want to advance to the next tier. You need to purchase shltty vehicle modifications you don\\'t need to have access to the ones you want. For every new vehicle you buy, you need to spend money so you can INVENT FIRE STINGUISHERS AGAIN. Everything. Everytime. Everywhere, you need to spend your money. You are not even entitled to choose the maps you want to play. You can choose ONE map out of the map rotation IF you accept to pay for their shltty subscription service. And there you go. Playing on a map you hate. A map deliberately poorly designed. You take a wrong turn. Your tank falls into a ditch, and guess what? GUESS WHAT? You must spend money to repair it.\\nLike, you have a Panzer IV Ausf. G, then you \"want\" to go to the Panzer IV Ausf H  (like, even if you don\\'t want you have no choice, you are forced to researcha and purchase every useless vehicle in the tecthree to unlock new ones) Ausf. G you must research EVERYTHING again, despite the  Ausf. H being literally just the  Ausf. G with some useless armor plate skirts added.\\n\\nAh, and you must pay for the AMMO you use. That\\'s serious.\\nI wonder how long it will take until they decide to charge us for the FUEL of the tanks. Or to pay wages to the tank crews. Like, they can use the excuse that they are trying to make the game more \"realistic\", and make you need to pay wages for the crews, pay for their dental plan, for their children\\'s colleges. \" Wellcome back, your crewmember Hans has suffered a heart attack and had to be rushed to the hospital. 40k lions have been taken from your account to pay for his medical expenses\".\\n\\nI would gladly pay $60 to play this game with at least all WW2 tanks.\\nBut all their offers are laughable. They are right now charging 30 dollars for a shitty T-34 tank and people are buying it. Yes, you heard right. A SINGLE vehicle that is just a slight upgrade of an existing free version.\\n\\nAnd yes, there is also the famous Russian bias. The devs are russians, and they are shamessly nationalistic and not afraid of trying to make their nation look the best. And how they do this in a game which takes pride of it\\'s extremely realistic vehicle stats? If they lie about the vehicle specs people will just check them in Wikipedia to call them out. What they do? Simple! Match them in anachronic fights. The IS-2 only saw action in 1944, mostly fighting against Tiger II tanks and Jagdpanzers. So you make it show up early to fight 1942 Tiger I, Panzer IVs, and Shermans instead. The PT-76 was one of the most useless tanks of the Cold War? A light tank that could barely hold itself against infantry? Well then just make it show up TEN YEARS earlier to fight early WW2 tanks. But yet it all backfired. In this poor attempt to overcompensate their insecurity and irrational patriotism, the devs just accidentaly showed how bad Soviet armor was, by proving that is completely possible for a SHERMAN to kill Cold-War Soviet tanks. Hilarious.\\nI don\\'t know about the Air Battles mode (I refuse to touch that mode with a ten foot pole. I\\'m h ere only for the tanks). But I heard from friends that Soviet planes are capable of ridiculously unrealistic feats.\\n\\nOn this state, I would refuse to spend 10 cents on this game. I just want to get a nice mug of black cofee in a rainy day, sit back and relax, drive my Tiger across the green hills while I listen to some classical music and calmly try to spot enemies with my bynoculars, and this is currently not possible with all the grinding pressure the game currently has.  I will come back again in a few years, maybe people will start to get tired of this game. Now there are no more new tanks to add. I don`t think they will be adding more modern aircraft because I doubt a game that prides itself of it`s realism would want to make F-15s and MiG-31s dogfight. (A F-4 vs. MiG-21 is the most modern dogfight you can get. More modern aerial warfare than that is basically just dots beeping in the radar and getting shot across the continent). Hopefully this game\\'s development cycle will end soon, people will start to leave due the lack of new content, and the devs may reduce these ridiculous grinding requirements to attract people back. Until then, I would not recommend anybody to waste their time with this grindfest. Go play games that respect your time.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The game asked me in a pop-up to leave a review similar to how a mobile game does. You want my review? He\\'s my review. I have waay more hours into this game than what Steam says. I\\'ve been playing this game since 2014 most of the time without Steam and with Gaijin\\'s own launcher. Gaijin is one of the most greediest, inept, and downright scummy developers I\\'ve had the unfortunate fate to stumble upon.\\n\\nGripe #1: The Grind\\nThis game takes months without spending real money to get the next vehicle you want once you reach Tier III. I remember being super excited to get to research my Tiger I H1 (long before the E ever came out) and it taking me close to 2 months of grinding just to get enough research to unlock it. The Tiger 1 H1 at this point is only a mid-tier vehicle. Imagine the grind once you get to modern vehicles. I\\'m currently researching the F-104A, this jet takes 390,000 research points, in a good game where you don\\'t immediately get thrashed (very common see Gripe #3 for more details) you earn about 1500 research points. A typical game lasts about 20 minutes. At this rate it would take you 260 good games or 86 hours of continuously sweat level gaming to unlock this jet without real money. That is close to half a week of no sleep, no family, and no job to unlock this jet and this isn\\'t even taking into account Gripe #3.\\n\\nGripe #2: The Economy\\nAnother way Gaijin entices you to spend real money is through the economy of the game. In this game, you have a multitude of purchases you have to make to progress and do good. These purchases are facilitated by the in-game currency you earn through play. There are many upgrades that you purchase in this way for your vehicles that bring you onto a level playing field because most people will have the upgrades and will put you at a severe disadvantage. For instance, just unlock that new shiny tank that you\\'ve been grinding for weeks? Well now you need to get the upgrades for it. One of the upgrades is a fire extinguisher. Take a shell to the fuel tank and it set your tank on fire? You need the fire extinguisher. It is one of the most crucial upgrades you will need. Bomber drops a bomb on your tank in spawn and takes out your engine? Guess you\\'ll be sitting in spawn for the whole time you want to use that tank or bail out early and pay full repair cost. Oh what\\'s repair cost? Only the most infuriating aspect of the economy. Its pretty simple, your vehicle blow up? You pay in-game currency to repair it so you can use it again. You want to know how repair costs are determined? Oh funny you should ask. They have a base cost that is then raised based on the VERY upgrades you need to do good. How is base cost determined? Who knows, its completely arbitrary. Have a tank that Gaijin thinks is too good for the tanks it faces? Lets just up the repair cost on that so you lose money every time you want to use the awesome tank you spent weeks grinding. Yes, once you get to higher tier (4+) more often than not you will be losing in-game currency instead of earning more like you did in the previous tiers. All of this together is meant to force you to buy premium or buy the currency outright. This wouldn\\'t be so bad if the prices weren\\'t so sky high ridiculous. Want premium for the month that will cut your grind in half? Cough up $10 a month. Don\\'t have any enough in-game currency to buy that F-104A? That will be $20 dollars to just BUY the jet. You still have to pay to select a crew for the jet and even more to for the upgrades on the jet that should come standard. You\\'re looking at about $35 to get just 1 jet airworthy.\\n\\nGripe #3: The Time Machine/Veteran Vehicle? Mo Problems\\nThis gripe could actually be two gripes but they are so closely related I\\'ll bunch them together. So to start with vehicles have arbitrary battle rating that Gaijin gives each vehicle so that they can matchmake their games and attempt to have balanced games. The only problem is that these battle ratings are often historically inaccurate and would never take place in the real world. Battle ratings exist to punish good vehicle designs. Here\\'s an example, remember my Tiger I H1 from above? It has a battle rating of 5.3. The way matchmaking works is this tank can be placed against any other vehicle within 1 full point of it. Now \"Wait\" you say \"Doesn\\'t that mean you have the opportunity to stomp lesser tanks?\" Yes that is a possibility but most of the time that won\\'t happen the way the game actually carries out matchmaking is that it will \"uptier\" you. What I mean by this is say you were in that Tiger I H1 90% of the time you are going to be placed in the higher 6.3 battle rating games. Now beings that you are in a German tank, you\\'re going to primarily see Soviet and American vehicles pitted against you. So what are some vehicles that exist at the same battle rating as your Tiger from these other countries? First one that comes to mind is the PT-76B. The PT-76B is a 1950s era Soviet APC/ARV. A 1950s vehicle going up against a vehicle that was design a whole decade prior. This is extremely broken in play as the PT-76B has access to more modern munitions that will slice through your Tiger like butter and has better acceleration due to its low weight. Absolutely broken. For the Americans you have a slew of Shermans with 76mm high velocity guns. Never mind the fact that most Shermans at this point still had 75mm guns that shot slow rounds. We\\'re sending your Tiger against vehicles that were meant to contend with your big brothers the King Tiger and Panther. Lets move the examples over to my other grind, American planes. I have a F-86F-25 Sabre. I regularly encounter AV-8 Harriers. A jet that was produced for Korea is going against a 1970s jet that is still in service today. You will get eaten alive by the air-to-air missiles that other jets have that your Sabre does not because they either weren\\'t invented yet or Gaijin added your version of the Sabre in before they embraced modern vehicles and their modern armaments. That\\'s right, I can go find Sabres that were added more recently in other countries\\' tech trees that have air-to-air missiles but the COUNTRY THAT DESIGNED THE JET AND THE MISSILES THE OTHER JETS HAVE does not have a single Sabre with missiles. This illustrates that Gaijin does not care about making veteran players happy. They only care about releasing the next vehicle to bring in more cash so they can line their pockets.\\n\\nIn summary, do not download this game, do not give this scummy company your hard earned greenbacks, and most certainly do not think they actually care about your criticism. These issues have persisted in the game for years and they have not lifted a finger to correct them. There are many more issues I could of discussed but these are the three that come to the top of my mind that infuriate me the most about this game. You could google \"gaijin.net agent\" or \"war thunder shill\" to get a quick glance at a couple other issues.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This. Game. Will. Break you.\\nI only have 90 hours on the Steam version of WT, but I have been playing this game since before Ground Forces came out (before tanks were added, and the game only had planes). Back then, it was pretty good. But as time went on, Gaijin decided to enter a competition with EA for Most Scummy Developers...and won. The grinding is unbelievable; you can forget about driving any of the cool tanks you recognize or flying any of the famous planes. If you absolutely MUST have the cool vehicles, then I hope you either have a lot of disposable income, or you\\'re willing to sacrifice a whole year of your life playing this game.\\n\\nIf you\\'re like me, you\\'ll start out patiently grinding, but eventually, inevitably, this game will break you. They say certain games are designed to be literally addictive- this is one of those games. You will suddenly find yourself willing to spend money you don\\'t even have in order to buy your way to the next level of aircraft, or pay just to have that new tank you unlocked \"upgraded\" so it becomes actually useful. You will become tempted to spend \"just another\" 5 bucks to make your pilot an ace, or to make your tank crew well-trained. You will be tantalized with pretty war machines to crack open your wallet once more, just so you can buy a \"premium\" vehicle that Gaijin will end up nerfing or even deleting a couple months later.\\n\\nThe entire game is designed to tease you and make you give up your money. There are shiny, premium vehicles galore. You can pay premium currency to skip past boring vehicles. After unlocking a new vehicle, it will barely be able to move or maneuver and will even be unable to repair broken parts...but you can make all those problems go away with another $5. Tired of boring one-tone paint for your tank? Buy a snazzy new camouflage. Have you finally reached the cool, high-level vehicles? Oh no, if they die in battle it costs you more money just to repair them than you make in that battle. Better spend another few bucks. Want to make your vehicle able to be used more than once per battle? Give Gaijin some money and you can do that. Are you tired of only being able to have two decals on your vehicle? Money can fix that! Do you just want one badass plane or tank to use forever, and you don\\'t care about any other vehicles? You can buy most high-level vehicles for $40 or more.\\n\\nThe jokes and memes are true, this game makes EA games look generous. Don\\'t play it. Even if you are the most pure-hearted, anti-microtransaction player who has locked all their money in an underground vault, don\\'t play it. The game is thoroughly engineered at every level so that you have to spend money to make the game fun enough to keep playing.\\nI barely went into detail.

       "  'review': '\"You Either Die A Hero, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Villain\"\\n\\nThis game was once a gem of F2P games. Unique, engaging gameplay, fresh concept, good balance of grind and microtransactions. Friendly developers loving their game and not at all greedy. Paving the way of new generation in MMO games.\\nI cant exactly put my finger on the exact moment when the game turned to worse. Maybe it was introduction of Abrams, maybe it was much earlier. No matter. \\nAs it stands now its aggresively monetized shitfest with developers that dont play their own game, dont communicate with playerbase and terrible moderators that filter out criticism causing more harm. Every patch logical and understandable changes are mixed with bad not well thought features that progressively make whole game worse and worse.\\n\\nGame is still solid in certain aspects and playing certain vehicles is fun. But on the whole i wouldnt recommend it to anybody.\\n\\nToo much focus was laid on monetization and somwhere in this pursuit of dollars terrible thing happened - game has lost its charm and became a chore to play. It was a long ride War Thunder. I will keep good memories.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Update:\\nSince posting my below review it should be noted:\\n[list]\\n    [*]None of the below mentioned issues have been fixed, or even remotely addressed. The developers are fundamentally and completely deaf to any and all community feedback and/or taking basic quality assurance measures in maintaining the game.\\n    [*]Multiple new, game breaking issues have been introduced, and game balance continues to deteriorate. Additional pay to win premium vehicles have been introduced, as well as extremely unfair ingame events based around squeezing money out of players through the game\\'s online marketplace,\\n    [*]The game continues to be based around a single core design concept: strongarm players into paying exorbitant amounts of money through intentionally damaging the quality of the core gameplay loop and dangling solutions in front of the player that must be repeatedly paid for.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThe game is, has been, and will remain utterly terrible.\\n\\nOriginal review:\\n\\nAs a disclaimer, I exclusively play this game for the ground forces mode, so won\\'t be addressing the air combat or naval modes, though in general many of my larger points carry over in some way.\\n\\nFirst off, what this game does well:\\n[list]\\n    [*]The modeling of the vehicles is amazing. Both in terms of detail and (mostly) in terms of handling, the models and effects for each vehicle make for a truly beautiful experience, especially when compared with other competitors in the armored combat game genre.\\n    [*]The actual basic gameplay mechanics of the ground combat are excellent. The realistic way in which vehicle damage and dynamics are modeled gives the game a weighty feel that captures the subject matter with enjoyable heft. Driving a tank in War Thunder feels much more fundamentally appealing than in other competing games such as World of Tanks.\\nThe rush of successfully scoring a kill in armored combat is awesome, and has kept me coming back for more despite the game\\'s many glaring flaws.\\n[/list]\\n\\nWith that out of the way, here are some of the reasons I do not recommend anyone pick up this game, even at the entry price of free:\\n[list]\\n    [*]The ingame economy and progression system is an exploitative, broken, and endlessly aggravating mess that has been terrible since the game first launched and has received only the tiniest of improvements over the many years it has been in active development. The rate of gain for \\'Research Points\\', the experience points used to unlock new vehicles, and \\'Silver Lions\\', the currency actually used to buy things, are both horrifically low, with the express goal of getting you to purchase \\'Golden Eagles\\', the game\\'s shiny play money that costs real money and can be used to effortlessly breeze your way forward so long as you\\'re willing to drop hundreds if not thousands of dollars (US, or your regional conversion) into the game.\\nRewards for gameplay are terribly low in the first place, but only get worse when you realize that [i]the game makes you pay to repair your vehicles and buy more ammunition after each battle[/i]. That\\'s right, if your vehicle is damaged or destroyed in a match, you have to pay Silver Lions to repair it. Even worse, each vehicle has unlockable ammo types, which are almost always much better than the vehicle\\'s free stock ammunition, each round of which will cost you more Silver Lions to purchase. This gets especially bad with high tier vehicles, the constant hype machines that the game uses to lure people in, resulting in many matches where you will lose significant sums of money if you miss a shot or have your vehicle damaged or destroyed. Given that the whole point of the game is to fight other players using, you know, tanks with guns on them, you will generally end close to 50% of your games looking at being charged for your insolence in thinking you can actually play the vehicles you spent hundreds of hours grinding to use.\\nAnd the vehicle grind? If you want to have the privilege of driving that shiny M1A1 or T-80u you had better be prepared to play every day for several years to top even one nation\\'s tech tree, which will probably be soured in the end because of the game constantly introducing unbalanced new units instead of fixing any of the glaring issues with the economy and progression system.\\n    [*]The balance. There is no balance. Vehicles are thrown with minimal concern across the Battle Rating (a number used to quantify a vehicle\\'s power and match it with similar vehicles) field, constantly leaving you fighting much more powerful units as you painfully claw your way up the tech tree, only to finally reach top tier and...\\nThere is also zero balance at top tier. New units are introduced constantly to keep the game rolling on announcement hype, with little concern for their performance or the meta they will create. The only pitiful excuse for balance the developers do implement is in increasing the costs for repairs and ammunition for over-performing vehicles, which does nothing but ensure that players who pay real money for in-game currency (did I mention you can just straight up buy Silver Lions with Golden Eagles? No? Yeah.) have a quantitative advantage in being able to operate overpowered units in every match, while those who refuse to invest their life savings into the game are left out in the cold, unable to pay the repair costs on vehicles they spent hundreds of hours earning.\\nIt gets even better when you introduce aircraft into the mix, because all modes for ground vehicles are actually \"Mixed Battles\", which let aircraft and helicopters join in on the fun. What I mean by \\'join in on the fun\\' is that in most matches where you play a tank you will end up being killed by a plane dropping a bomb on you rather than being destroyed by another tank. This only gets worse in top tier matches, where helicopters can hover at extreme range from the battlefield and one-shot-kill tanks using anti-tank guided missiles, which they get a large number of, meaning that you have to spend half your time trying to enjoy playing a ground vehicle constantly looking out for and dodging air vehicles. The developers\\' fix for this? Introduce overpowered anti-aircraft ground units, which are of course top-tier vehicles that you are required to grind for.\\nThis is all made much, much worse by the design of the maps that you do your actual fighting on, most of which look very nice, but are some of the worst I have ever seen in terms of game design. Sight lines are nonsensical and cover is scattered around seemingly at random, with many maps allowing enemy vehicles to find ways to shoot into one team\\'s spawn locations from the mid point of the map, leaving players respawning late in the game to be instantly annihilated. And added bonus is that there\\'s also nothing to prevent aircraft from camping players leaving their spawns, meaning that you might not even get the chance to see your enemy before a bomb or missile exterminates you 10 meters from your spawn point.\\n    [*]The bugs. There have been reasonable improvements in the game over time in the bug department, but there still remain many annoying issues that will swoop in to disrupt your experience. The game\\'s physics engine is a common culprit, ensuring your tank is launched into the air by a rock or killed by an enemy shell that ricochets through the Nth dimension to somehow wipe out your vehicle. It\\'s less of a pain point than the above points, but it does happen, and it will ruin your day.\\n[/list]\\n\\nAll in all War Thunder offers a unique and compelling gameplay experience that I do not recommend anyone check out, because it serves only as a lure for a terribly unfair monetization scheme backed up by countless glaring issues in basic game design that will leave you  gnashing your teeth and swearing profusely far more often than delivering the tantalizing enjoyment that the game might otherwise deliver.\\n\\nIt\\'s not worth your time, and it\\'s definitely not worth your money.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Update after 3 years: \"The game got worse, now on top of the already existing unparalleled anti-consumer practices, they added battle passes and drove the prices in the player market to extremes. The game requires now ALL your free time, or a large part of your wallet. Even in that case, you will never be able to get all the vehicles, so if you have a completionist urge and are not interested in spending 2000$ for a vehicle, stay away.\"\\n\\nOriginal Review\\nI am playing War Thunder since the beta, when unlocking planes was actually enjoyable and there were no \"stock\" useless vehicles. Many \"new\" simpleminded fans that defend Gaijin don\\'t know that this game didn\\'t have a research system back then, while now it even has the same spotting mechanics of World of Tanks. Although they\\'re more refined, like pretty much every aspect of the game. This one can be considered as a semi-sim with also an arcade mode.\\n\\n[i]I own a Premium Account since release and most premium vehicles. Please read it trough the end, because this review is not about the quality of its gameplay, it goes beyond that. I hope Gaijin will notice the reviews and understand why the population has dropped trough the years, with an average of 80-100k players online before the 1.37 (when there was no research system), to an average of 30-40k (with tanks too). Triple the content, less than half population.[/i]\\n\\nAfter all the miscommunications (bugs being fixed a year after the community notified it, disliked events, introduction of loot boxes to get old-limited-events vehicles and more) and the continuous mocking and hostility of the moderator [b]Stona[/b] towards members of the community, even when they only ask for changes to the balancement or japanese prototype tanks (they have a poor tree and are unplayable), I thought that I had to write a new review for the game.\\n\\nWhat can I say, the War Thunder has gone a long way since then. New nations, an entire new tank-based game (Ground Forces) and the announcement of the both ships and helicopters in the near future. It\\'s sad to see the player base dropping costantly every year, since the 100k+ that were when we had only planes, to 20-30k.\\nUnfortunately, while the content has slowly got better, the progression has not. I also made the horrible choice to grind Japan. While the first two tiers are enjoyable by free2players too, the higher we go on the research tree, the worst it get, to a point where dying may even give you a negative amount of money. To me, with a premium account and 50€ premium tanks with extra rewards, it may not be a problem, but it is to anyone else. The grinding for research points gets tedious since mid-game for tanks and late-game for planes, and you have to consider also the amount of money needed to do everything: \\nDo you want to buy an unlocked vehicle? Buy it. Do you want to equip it to a crew? Pay (even 290k for top tiers). Do you want to shoot? Buy the ammo, Is it broken? Buy the repair service. What about events? Pay for the ticket.\\nSure, it is immersive to pay for some features, but all of this balance create a lot of issues to other players. \\n\\nAnd what about the modifications? When you research and buy a vehicle, it doesn\\'t come at his max potential. It\\'s a stock vehicle, with basic ammo, a worst engine and whatsoever. If you\\'re interested in planes you should be good, your plane will be usually worse than the others but you\\'ll be able to play and slowly spade it (i.e. max it). Oh you\\'re interested in tanks?\\n\\nThen [b] welcome to fucking hell.[/b]\\n\\nTo make a tank playable you usually need at least two upgrades: Parts and FPE. Parts is an upgrade that let you repair your vehicle, FPE is an extinguisher to put off the fire. To get the FPE you first need to unlock another upgrade, so a total of 3 upgrades are necessary. MANY tanks are also useless at their battle rating (another issue which I\\'ll describe later) and to make them playable you\\'ll need advanced ammo, which may request up to 4-5 upgrades first.\\n\\n[i]\"Hey but I just unlocked the parts with one match\"[/i]\\n\\nHeh, sure it\\'s good to play at Rank I-II, when you only 2-5k research points each. At Rank V-VI it becomes 16-24k, even 40k in some cases.\\n\\nImagine having to grind 16k (Average f2p gets 2-3k I think, when it actually get kills. A premium player with a premium vehicle usually get 10k) without penetrating ammo, without being able to repair as soon as something hit you and with the survivability of a dodo. What if I matchmake your tank to an higher battle rating? Owww damn, your tank exploded right away, it was expectable indeed. Pay me 8k please to repair it.\\n\\nRepeat that for every new vehicle you\\'ll unlock. Welcome to Ground Forces. Fortunately you can pay to buy a Rank IV/V premium vehicle and enjoy the bonus rewards and a fully spaded tank. 49,99€ over your sanity. And don\\'t forget to buy the experience for your crew or they will suck. Always, even after 200hr you will not have enough experience to max a single crew and you\\'ll pay real money to do that.\\n\\nLast, about that battle rating I mentioned: it basically represent the strenght of a tank on a fictional \"tier list\".  It influence the matchmaking. Whenever you queue the game uses your highest rated vehicle in your formation and searches for other players with the same battle rating OR a fluctuation of +1/-1. If you use a 6.7 tank, you may end up with other tanks from 5.7 to 7.7.\\nObviously the chance you will end up in a 7.7 match are 80% and guess what, most tanks will become extremely hard to play and - if lacking FPE/Parts/ammo - the may become completely useless.\\n\\nMix all of that and do your math. It\\'s a well-made game, fun, varied and with both arcade and simulative modes, but this is really infuriating and has to stop. Get back on track.\\n\\n\\nGaijin will never read this, but by making these two small changes they would make it surely more fun and bring back the community. The reduced matchmaking would be compensated by bigger numbers. I\\'d also remove the \"Parts\" from the game, but I guess that\\'s too much to ask to Gaijin.\\n\\n[list]\\n    [*]+50% rewards to all vehicles (they use visible % under every vehicle to balance the rewards)\\n    [*]Reduce the matchmaking from +1/-1 to +0.7/-0.7.\\n[/list]\\n\\nThere are more than 1000 vehicles right now, at least 3 more than when it started. It\\'s time to reduce the grinding to these new standards. Even more if we include the upcoming ships, the italian army and the mentioned \"two new nations in the next years\". How is a new player supposed to reach rank III/IV in three different modes and multiple nations?\\nMost new players stop after third/fourth rank of a single nation. I am sure that letting them focus on more nations wouldn\\'t reduce the income, they will probably end up buying more premium vehicles.',\n",

       "  'review': 'DON\\'T TOUCH THIS. War Thunder is the most addictive, yet toxic game i haver ever played. Only reason anyone plays this is because this is because there is no other game like it. Ofcourse there is world of planes, tanks, ships. But none of them have the \"realism\" theme that WT has. You play and get hooked with how good the planes look and it\\'s pretty easy in the start with you being able to get a new vehicle every 10,20,30 matches and upgrades every 2nd match. But then you get to 4.0 and then the grind hits, you need to play for hours every day just to make any progress or keep up with one tech tree not mentioning 1 or 2. Which is when people just pay for premium accounts, and new vehicles. I mean we get it, you have to put food on the table, but This. This is just greed, if you want to ever see jets you\\'re going to have to pay, if you want to finish a single tech tree without paying? \"Play\" for 6-8 hours every day for years and you might get to cold war era tech. Eventualy you get bored and leave, but then find nothing else like WT and eventually come crawling back to this psycho abusive bitch girlfriend of a game. IF there was ever a single company that would announce a game with the same concept, and didn\\'t abuse it\\'s playerbase and listend to them even for one time, it would take about 2 weeks for everyone to forget this game',\n",

       "  'review': \"*3200 hours* As you can see I have devoted way to much time into this game and I will likely continue because I feel that I have already invested too much to just drop this game. The biggest issue with this game is the devs, or atleast their corporate. (Now don't think i'm just some commie that doesn't like capitalism). Gaijin constantly says that they wont do this or wont do that but they turn right around and use some loop hole to claim that they didn't break their promise. This is most visible with the KA-50 helicopter. They claimed they would never add top tier premiums then about a year later added the KA-50, which is a helicopter that is put one rank below top rank and .3 BR lower than top tier. It sits behind a $50 price wall. They do shet like this all the time. The community gets mad at them and Gaijin just goes look at this new thing for you to spend hours of your free time to get and the community shuts up and licks it all up and acts like nothing happened till something else happens. Gaijin is inconsistent with what they say when it comes to balance. They have just left the game mode that started this thing on the back burner for years. And with all the issues this game has they just add more crap and wont fix their game. The community has been asking for a much needed BR decompression but Gaijin refuses and continues to make their game worse by adding more and more. this game could be so much better if Gaijin would listen to the player base and try to make things better rather than pat their bottom line constantly, so you have been warned play this game at the risk to your own sanity. Clearly mine left long ago.\\n\\n*5328 hours* Please help meeeeee just end it now\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I genuinely once believed in Gaijin to be a reasonable company that would put aside moronic and neanderthalic greed in place for a game that could bring in a larger audience and expose to a larger audience the appeal to being an armchair weapon and vehicle historian. However ever since 2012 my hours used in this game have only proven me wrong as time has gone on, I\\'ve unlocked almost every vehicle, every achievement, and yet everytime I play this game I feel like a battered house wife in an abusive relationship with a husband who sells his wife just to make his own business gain more profit. As such I always have strong feelings for when a change is implemented and when the game is \"rebalanced\" for the sake of \"fun\". The game isn\\'t fun, the game is in fact a chore to play. You genuinely have a better chance to get a part time job and just buy a T-72 irl, that\\'s how much the grind is in this game. By the time you would have spent 5 years irl saving up money to buy a soviet armored car, you would have gotten the same vehicle in this god forsaken game. The game always remains with potential to become far grander in scale and if anything far more entertaining in execution. However, gaijin as a company is no worse in greed than EA. EA by comparison, has far more respect from me than Gaijin simply due to their transparency to their choices and their greed, I at the very least am given an explanation as of to why such changes are applied to an EA game, however with Gaijin it\\'s just radio silence no matter the change. One day you will have a new vehicle working just fine, and the next patch the vehicle is upside down and flying into the sky just like the 1.64 patch with the flying upside down churchills... I genuinely believe you have a better chance working and slaving away in a part time job at amazon than you would spending the same amount of time in this game to get a high tier vehicle. As such, in conclusion, save your time and money, just play something else',\n",

       "  'review': \"I have a hard time recommending this game right now, and I will explain why....\\n\\nAt least here on steam, I don’t have to worry about being bullied by Gaijin for writing a critical review. I really want to like this game. Unlike a lot of kiddies who post on the forums, I am much older. I am a gamer from the 80's, growing up on simulators from the 80's and 90's like F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Interceptor, Birds of Prey, Their Finest Hour, Knights of the Sky, etc. These were on the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, etc. \\n\\nIf you are younger and unfamiliar with these titles, look them up. It will give you an idea of how long I have been around flying the cyber skies and coming from an experienced point of view.  I guess that's why I am amused when kids try to lecture players who have been flying sims for decades before they were even on the earth. So, for the younger among us, you can learn something from your elders. \\nWarthunder is very frustrating, it has the potential to be a really good game, but instead is held back by Russian nationalism and left over cold war era mentalities. \\n\\nI have spent many hours and money on this game, I have supported them financially and really have given them time to fix their problems, unfortunately they continue to run with a delusional narrative. \\n\\nOften you will hear people claim there is a Russian bias to the game. Well, to be blunt, yes, it true. The only people who argue otherwise always prove to be A) of Russian decent themselves and take it personally, B) Are apologists for Gaijin and tote the typical fan boy nonsense, or C) They use Russian tanks or planes and are comfortable in their over powered vehicles, afraid they will be taken away. \\n\\nRecently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that “they cater to the Russian audience because that’s where the money is, they also don’t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech”…\\n\\nSo what does this mean exactly?....Basically he is saying they’re going to fudge the facts for the sake of Russian ego?\\nI take issue with Warthunder because Gaijin continues to claim they strive for “historical accuracy” however they have shown no real attempt to make that so. \\n\\nThey make disparaging comments about German WWII tanks, planes and tech of the era. They claim their hardware was inferior to Soviet hardware, and all the publications that say otherwise is pure “western propaganda”.\\nAny objective student of WWII history knows the Germans were known for having very advanced superior equipment. There is a reason Both the U.S. and the Soviets were grabbing up as many German scientist and tech as they could at the end of the war. \\n\\nThe Planes and Tanks\\n\\nWarthunder has dishonestly taken Russian planes that were underperforming or produced in low numbers, and exaggerated their abilities. They also have a whole SEPARATE development team for the Russian planes vs the rest of the planes. What does that tell you? \\n\\nThe P-38 lightning doesn’t perform anything like its real counterpart, I thought, “man, this plane flies like crap”, so I did some research. I found out that Gaijin gave the P-38 a heavy bomber/fighter flight model, they assigned the A-20 flight model to the P-38 lighting! But wait, what did they do with Russian planes that had unfinished flight models? They were simply void of any drag penalties. Instead, they left out variables on the planes, causing them to perform UFO like Arial maneuvers. \\n\\nThe bombers are all nerfed with bomb load capacity, however without any explanation, the Russian Yer is conveniently left without the same changes, and is allowed a higher capacity. \\n\\nALL U.S. Navy aircraft are atrocious. They don’t perform near to their real models. The  F-4U Corsair, which was nick named “whispering death” by the Japanese can’t be flown more than two minutes without it beginning to overheat. \\n\\nThe P-63, which was not a very good plane in general, is given super capabilities. Gee…is that because the Russians used this plane in the war from Lend Lease? Well, what does this tell you? If you look up the P-63 for the Americans, and the P-63 for the Russians, WOW!....the P-63 for the Russians is magically superior in performance despite being an export of the same plane. \\n\\nThe bombers?....They use to perform ok. Now their destroyed with a massive nurf where a couple of shots from a machine gun will explode a B-29! Its truly ridiculous. \\n\\nWanting to see for myself, I began to fly Russian planes. Sure enough, the ease in which I could fly around and destroy the enemy with ease was absurd. I shook my head in disgust and quit right there. I later came back and tried again, yet the same thing is happening in tanks as well. You have T-34’s driving around pawning Tigers for crying out loud. \\nThere is so much examples of this, we could be here all day. This is only further supported by their absurd forum posts where they talk about Soviet tech being superior to all other nations in WWII. It really is amazing how strong their bias truly is. \\n\\nThen, Gaijiin behaves like a bunch of KGB thugs. If ANYONE brings up anything deemed slightly critical on their forums, ALL dissent is immediately locked, silenced and deleted. Threads are deleted or locked, and people get banned, simply for holding an opinion they don’t like. Google Gajiin extorion scandal\\n\\nThat behavior alone truly is disgusting. Here is a real kicker though….look at Gaijiin rules for the games. They state that “historical characters who violated human rights are not permitted to be mentioned”. \\n\\nHmm…so History they don’t approve of is out, talking about history is out….but here is the best part. Hitler is a no no…can’t talk about him. But wait!......Stalin, a monster who arguably was just as bad if not worse than Hitler, killing 20 million or more of his own people, he is perfectly fine! In fact, Warthunder will even let you put the words “For Stalin” in Russian on the side of your tank or plane! YAY for double standards! \\n\\nTeam Work?.....foget about it! You have kids flying around ramming, or...while you are working on a plane, they will show no dicipline or respect at all. Rather then hold off your wiing, they will try to fly in front of you while your shooting, and take your kill! Now, 3 things happen here. A} They fly infront of your fire and get hit, then you get penalized for team damge. They also will idiotically accuse you of twam killing. B) they dont get hit by your fire, but cause you to have to break off to avoid a collsion and screw up your kill. Or C) they collide into you, and then accuse you of ramming them. \\n\\nThere is no mutual respect for team work in this game. It would help if they would implement coms for the whole team, and allow more then 4 players in a squad. Another nice feature would be the ability to fly in the same plane. Firends should be able to get in a bomber together. \\nAs of now, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad seems to be clearly much better. \\nIn the end, this is a good game that could be great. It really could be. Unfortunately, it’s undermined by its own developers who have been spoon fed Communist era propaganda to the point of absurdity, who then turns around and can’t help but put it in their own game, only to pull oppressive tact by silencing anyone who dares to point out such nonsense. \\nI have been waiting a long time for them to get with the program; unfortunately I am most likely waiting in vain. \\nWarthunder has become nothing but a propaganda mill, with Delusional re-writes of history where Red Army planes filled the skies and dominated over the Luftwaffe and all other nations. It’s a joke and insult to call this poor excuse of a “simulator” anything close to being “historically accurate”…only in the world of Commie make believe is this game close to anything historical. \\n\\nSadly, I’ll probably still play this game, only to be constantly reminded of how great it could be. I have given Gaijin about $100.00 of my money, and sadly I will never get its worth.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'after around 8000 hours total playtime, i cant recommend this game. it sucked me in, it removed my soul. it caused me years of addicting frustration. now there is absolutely nothing left holding me. the grind is insufferable, the stock grind encouraging you to spend real money unless you are willing to play a vehicle for 10-100 games to unlock its full potential, the higher the tier goes the worse it gets. and also the more noticable the stock syndrom becomes. this game is beginner unfriendly, bad match making. Gaijin over the years has turned into nothing but a greedy company. they used to care alot more about the game  back in the days, and in my opinion, the moment they decided to add the IS6 it all went downhill, because what followed after sooner or later were top tier premiums. before they never touched that, there werent nearly as many power creeping ridiculously viable premium machines. let alone beginners ruining high tier just because they opened their wallet, its ridiculous, pathetic, and infuriating. the only good thing i have to say about this game is arcade tanks nowadays and arcade/realistic air for props. jets are a no go. the more modern jet games all end within 3-8 minutes starting the moment you spawn on the runway. the f100 era and alike are barely playable because of guess what, pay to win jets you can see, that have missiles you cannot defend against in most subsoncis, let alone most super sonics, of course its also the premiums that get the good missiles and counter measures 90% of the time.\\ni have never seen a game thats in such a pathetic and awful state as war thunder.\\ntouching anything above ww2 era honestly just makes me suicidal. blatant and obvious cash grabs, there is absolutely nothing else to this game anymore.\\nsure the game might be fun for the first 100-1000 hours for any beginner that decides to stick with gaijins BS but the flaws sooner or later will be noticed by said beginners to a point where they cant enjoy the game anymore either.\\nand dont get me started on the piss poor map design, its nonexistent, its either brawl maps or maps where you camp at 5KM distance, and both suck. the map designing is just as bad as in world of tanks lmao.\\nthe only time where jet gameplay for super sonics becomes fun is the EC maps (basically gigantic maps) but they only happen rarely in the rotation.\\nthen gaijin has poor noodle coding, where a bug fix causes 2 new bugs. a new feature causes 5 other bugs.\\nits a never ending nightmare at this point.\\nreally just dont ever start playing this game for the sake of your own sanity, and if you do, i can assure you that anyone will be fed up within 100-1000 hours even if they turn into a god tier player with a solid 5-10 KD.\\nmy PoV is being an above average player, but lets be real here 95% of the active playerbase currently are just average players with a 1-1.5KD.^\\n\\nupdate 1,\\nnow there has been a very fun memory leak with all games modes except for air realistic/arcade\\nmeaning that you gotta restart the game every 3-6 games of ground, helicopters, and naval.\\nhow long has this problem existed now? i dont know the specific time but lets just say the last big patch did that, or maybe even the big patch before that. all of my friends who play wt experience the same memory leak issues btw.\\n\\nas you can see and like i described above, new bugs just start showing up, and this time gaijin doesnt even bother fixing something as critical as that.\\nhow unexpected.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]This is an extensive review of what to expect going into another Free-To-Play game and its business practices. This review is aimed for new players looking to get into the tank part of the game.[/h1]\\n\\n[i]Note : If you are interested in aircraft or ships, skip this one.[/i]\\n\\n\\nThe game is developed by a Russian company, Gaijin - they work with another company to make the vehicle models and other individuals and contributors to get real data/information on how they performed in real life and how to best represent that in-game.\\n\\n[b]The Positives Side : [/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] The graphics are stunning. Very accurate models, world detail and the new Dagor 5.0 engine did wonders for the game and they\\'ve promised even more optimizations in the recent Russian stream. The overall feeling is quite good, although the warlike atmosphere (such as smoke clouding the skies) could be a bit better. \\n[*] UK, USA, Russia, Germany, France, Japan and soon Italy will be participating in ground battles. Each nation with their own playstyle, shells, armor layouts making for a refreshing experience.\\n[*] Accurate ballistics and armor composition make for a tactical tank combat that requires knowledge before player skill. In-game stat cards give an overall idea of what the tank is capable of, how much punching power it has and what type of it can deal with. It\\'s quite a steep learning curve for the first hundred hours and even by then you\\'ll still have questions about how to deal with certain targets and what to look for. [i]Hint : Look for answers on youtube and reddit, not in-game.[/i] Rome wasn\\'t built in a day and you will certainly not understand War Thunder\\'s mechanics early on. \\n[*] The tank models are really well made. I mentioned this before and I would like to emphasize on the \"weight\" of the tank compared to Wargaming\\'s World of Tanks. You can really feel like you\\'re driving a tank and not Mario Kart. The pacing is slow in two game modes, and a bit quicker in the other one (more below).\\n[*] The sounds are excellent. From 12.7mm Anti-Air guns, to big 150mm Sturmpanzer cannon - deeper, realistic and satisfying shell sounds are what help with immersion when playing this game. \\n[*] Three game modes to please every tank player - Arcade, Realistic, Simulator. All have their differences ranging from engine power (with Simulator being the closest to real values and arcade having extra power) to aiming assistance. \\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] The Negative :[/b]\\n[list]\\n[*] Gaijin has to be one of the worst offenders in gaming history. If you have an extensive gaming experience you are already thinking of Nexon, Trion, EA, and half of the developers in the MMORPG market. The one thing they do not have compared to Gaijin is the [b]grip on a niche audience[/b]. You see, there\\'s no competitor to War Thunder in the entire gaming industry. World of Tanks and Armored Warfare target a different audience - one that likes arcade style hitpoints, peak-a-boo style of tank play. The audience of War Thunder is completely different. You have community members who spend an absurd amount of time finding documents, conducting research unlike in any other community you\\'ll ever see. Because there\\'s no competitor on the market for a realistic war game with tanks and aircraft/ships, [b]they own this entire audience and they know it[/b]. This company has pulled of unprecedented levels of unprofessionalism and lack of communication with the playerbase that would\\'ve grounded [b]ANY[/b] company including the owner of this store you\\'re reading this review on. Constant lies, fabricated \"sources\" and documents, selective feedback. I could go on forever here, but EA has that stigma because it was Star Wars and that hurts Americans, not because they\\'re worse than Gaijin.\\n[*] Infurating matchmaker - The matchmaker is set to +- 1 battle rating. What this means is that having your best tank a 3.7 Sherman you will at worst be matched with players that have either a 4.7 vehicle as their best, or at best with players who have a 2.7 tank as top. In lower tiers this is not really an issue, you will learn and adapt to a different playstyle. However as you move up into late World War 2 vehicles where armor really matters and further into Cold War T-54s the matchmaker becomes such a problem to the point of frustration. Depending on the game, your best tank will not be able to penetrate frontally any of the enemy teams excluding cupolas and machine gun ports (if they have one). The community has been asking for a +- 0.7 battle rating matchmaker for [b]YEARS[/b], but they haven\\'t listened and never will. Good luck fighting an American T29 heavy tank hull down on your Panther D, you will never win.\\n[*] When you get a new tank, you get a stock performance which can be further improved by researching modules such as \"Engine\", which gives a better acceleration, \"Brakes\" that help you break quicker and allow for quick retreating if you\\'re caught off-guard and many others. Among these modules you have two culprits where one of the shittiest player frustration mechanic in the game is - \"Parts\" and \"Fire Prevention Equipment\". Without the first one, you cannot repair your tank, unless you\\'re sitting on your objective. If you take a shot and your gun breech is damaged, you\\'re out of combat for the rest of the game, since shooting with a broken gun breech will detonate the shell inside your own tank. If you take a shot to your transmission you\\'ll be stationary the rest of the game. If a similar situation happens 20 seconds into the game...you can see how fun that might be. The best is FPE - if you get shot in your engine or fuel tanks, you\\'ll be set on fire. You guessed it, without this module you\\'ll continue burning until you\\'re dead. The removal of these two modules has been asked since closed beta - Gaijin refused.\\n[*] Community management - No developer reads the international forum in English. Instead there are moderators who \"forward\" suggestions to them for review. This is fine, they\\'re not required to know English, it\\'s an absurd request. The moderators on the other hand are absolute morons and worthless human beings on a power trip. If they do not like your suggestion your post will never appear. Your communication with the developer is entirely gone because no one heard it - not your fellow players who could upvote that or give feedback to you on how to improve it, or why your idea is totally wrong and you should come back with a better one. Radio silence, it\\'s gone. They shut down opinions they do not like or that highlight the Russian favoritism that is present in game (there\\'s plenty of evidence of this, ask me below if you want) and ban everyone that talks back. Truly one of the worst forums out there.\\n[/list] \\n\\nSomething to note about the community in-game : I was a bit surprised coming from World of Tanks and it\\'s cesspool. Most games go without anyone talking other than radio commands \"Attack X\", \"Defend X\", \"Follow Me\" etc. Very rarely do you get dirtbags and flame wars, it\\'s surprising in a PvP game. Usually it\\'s someone venting in [ALL] about bias, rarely personal. They\\'re far more talkative in Simulator Tank Battles, really nice as well. Overall a decent community I would say, on reddit too if you ignore some of the usual internet types. \\n\\n[b] Final thought :[/b]\\n\\nThe game itself is excellent, there\\'s nothing like it which is why I\\'ve played it for so long. It\\'s interesting, you also tend to learn things you never knew just by playing and talking to other community members - tanks, the war, other projects, prototypes and so on. \\n\\nI wouldn\\'t recommend it to anyone however. The further you go, the sadder you\\'ll feel about what a company like Grinding Gear, Digital Extremes or Obsidian could\\'ve done with this. This is the best war game on the Steam store, made by the worst company.',\n",

       "  'review': 'would be the best online tank/plane game there is IF, Gaijin wasn\\'t as greedy as they are. They\\'ve become increasingly money hunrgy, and have now launched their own \"market\" where you can buy tanks/plane, that were preaviously only available if you put in a lot of time to do a challenge in a specific time.\\n\\nnow however they offer their own \"lootboxes\" where you can get these vhicles and just sell them on their own market (which uses their own curency ofcourse, that you can\\'t turn into real life cash). The people that originaly went through the effort of getting these vheicles then get nothing but a big middle finger in return. Because they know long time players wont leave (atleast not completely, mabye just a break for a few months) because there\\'s no other game out there like it.\\n\\ni just hate to see a game i\\'ve played so much slowly go down the shitter, just for some easy cash instead of fixing big issues that have been there for the start. Instead of fixing the gameplay or adding more stuff to do, like new game modes, They just add more tanks/planes... ect. because that\\'s how they get some easy cash.\\n\\nalso they may have added helicopters and boats, but you gotta PAY TO TEST THEM FOR GAIJIN. Boats should have been releaced a year or two ago, but no, they know that if they keep it in \"closed beta\" they\\'ll earn way more money off it, because then the people who love the game and have seen most of what it has already, will have to buy a 40$ hellicopter/boat instead of just playing the regualr old cluster fuck that is tank or air realisitc battles. so now both boats and planes are in beta, and probably will be for another century..\\n\\n\\nI just rambled through this entire review, but i really care for the game and the community, but the devs are as shady as you get, one of the tips they give new players is \"spend some cash\"',\n",

       "  'review': 'this game has very well defined gameplay loops and very well refined mechanics. These mechanics are not for you however, every choice made by the dev team is to further your suffering and tempt you to spend money to get past the many road blocks this game uses. This is most easily seen in ground RB where at mid to high tiers as all progress is stagnated, rebuy cost become prohibitively expensive, and the age gap between tanks spans decades instead of years. I understand that I have many an hour in this game, however the last 1000 hours have largely been of the same line ups with no noticeable progress in research. this game will leave you bitter and unwilling to do what is actually fun. I concede that the battles themselves are enjoyable at times and no other games do it better. However this dose not imply that this game does it right. do not lie to yourself and say it gets better, just go play a better game.',\n",

No game simulates armor, ammo, penetration and post pen damage like War Thunder.\\n\\nBut the developers are greedy, even for a FTP game design.\\n\\nBalance is a mess, the grind is impossible, even as a premium account player, within reasonable time frames.  Repair costs are ridiculous and the game is, in part, balanced around the repair costs (which is stupid).  A conventional 4 engine bomber can cost 30,000 to repair while a modern jet bomber costs a third of that.  Say what?\\n\\nThe Battle Rating system is too compressed so that when you fight tanks a full BR higher than you, you can be in an early post WWII tank fighting IFVs with ATGMs.\\n\\nI am a high hour, premium account player, and for some reason more than 85% of my games are uptiers and more than 50% are FULL uptiers, making it challenging to research new tanks and make SLs to pay for repairs.\\n\\nI love it. I hate it.  Don't play it if you value your sanity.  I used it as an anger management tool.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Skyrim is the digital equivalent of crystal meth. Once you start playing it, you\\'ll never stop. You might pause every so often, like a distracted magpie tempted by some shiny new gaming trinket, but you\\'ll never truly stop. Deep in the bowels of Bethesda HQ, Todd Howard made an unholy pact with the forces of darkness that compels people to play his game incessantly. Even if they\\'ve already bought it 57 times on 39 different platforms. It\\'s a form of collective madness, and there\\'s no way to combat it. What\\'s that? You have a job to go to? Well... who\\'s going to return Meridia\\'s Beacon? Kids to feed? That\\'s nice and all, but someone really needs to reforge Gaulder\\'s Amulet. And it might very well be your wedding anniversary this weekend, but this civil war isn\\'t about to resolve itself, is it? Priorities people!\\n\\nSkyrim\\'s like Disneyworld. Everyone loves it. Little kids play Skyrim. (They shouldn\\'t because it can be scary and gruesome, and you\\'re an irresponsible parent for permitting it, but they do.) Doddering bed-wetters in retirement villages across the globe play Skyrim. (And they shouldn\\'t either, because having a frostbite spider leap out of a shrubbery at you could very well provoke a heart attack or stroke.) It\\'s a game that has multi-generational appeal. Todd Howard\\'s monstrous ambition knows no limits, his target demographic being literally \\'anyone with a pulse\\'.\\n\\nYes, Witcher 3 might have nicer graphics, some incredible quests, and more sophisticated swordplay. And, Horizon Zero Dawn might have a jaw-droppingly lush sci-fi/fantasy world, and a brilliant heroine. And, of course, Red Dead Redemption 2 has cowboys, colourful, believeable characters, and a story that grabs you by the throat like a rabid wolverine, refusing to let go until the very end. But they\\'re not Skyrim. They don\\'t have the eleven secret herbs and spices that make Todd Howard\\'s particular brand of open-world witchcraft so finger-lickin\\' good.\\n\\nJeremy Soule\\'s soundtrack helps. It\\'s not often I\\'ll pause after caving in the skull of an angry bear to sway gently in my chair like a mesmerised cobra, a look of glassy-eyed contentment plastered across my gormless visage, but listening to \\'Distant Horizons\\' for the 482nd time will do it. The eye candy built into the Special Edition also induces moments of introspection. Sitting on horseback, overlooking a gorge in The Reach as the volumetric fog curls lazily about me, and godrays lance between the gnarled branches of stunted trees... it\\'s like something out of a Boris Vallejo painting. The world of Skyrim is a character in itself, and it sucks you in like a quantum singularity made of dragons and stoic men with unnecessarily large beards.\\n\\nIf you\\'re one of the last seven people on Earth who still hasn\\'t played Skyrim... don\\'t. Run far, far away, and don\\'t look back. This is a game that will consume your every waking moment; worse, it will invade your dreams like a creeping phantasm. Your significant other will elbow you in the kidneys as you flail about the mattress, desperately attempting to escape the imaginary minions of Hermaeus Mora. When your kids won\\'t stop pestering you, you\\'ll suddenly turn on them and scream \"Fus Ro Dah!\", and they\\'ll stare at you with that all-too-familiar mixture of pity and disdain. \"Don\\'t be a sad freak, Dad. It\\'s embarrassing.\"\\n\\nI have spent over 3,000 hours engrossed in this game -- time I could have spent bonding with my loved ones, working to further my career, or building a really cool treehouse. These are hours of my life I will never get back. Fleeting, irreplaceable seconds of existence forever lost to Alduin\\'s fanged maw, and Todd Howard\\'s malignant dreams of global dominion. And yet I regret none of it. Not one pointless, unproductive minute. And given the chance to do it all over again, I would. God help me, I would. It\\'s too late for me. I\\'m a lost cause. But there is hope yet for you. Go. Save yourselves. Flee, you fools!\\n',\n",

       "  'review': 'Game was and still is so cool, but what\\'s more remarkable to me is how easy is to look for/install/use the mods this time.\\nI usually play the standard mode, sometimes due to my laziness, but this game has quite a few excellent mods, especially if you are looking for a nice immersion and realism, a couple of things that you couldn\\'t find at the original skyrim. This mixed with the new graphics from the special edition makes it SO enjoyable, even when you role-play warming up for 5 minutes next to a fire pit.\\nMods i use:\\n- Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition: this fixes most of the bugs of the game\\n- Campfire: Lets you build a campfire and different sorts of tents\\n- Vivid weathers: Over 500+ Weathers with different sounds and adjustable brightness, shadows, etc.\\n- Frostfall: Depending on how difficult you want it, you can even freeze to death and rain makes you be wet and get colder faster\\n-  Wet and Cold: Same thing but mostly for NPCs. Also includes some other features like blurry screen when you look up while it\\'s rainning or snowing.\\n-  Point the way: Since i\\'m looking for some realism i avoid fast travelling, this is why i got this mod, which shows me the way to every city at every crossroad.\\n- Lampposts of Skrim: Lamp posts on the main roads, but just what is necessary, not plenty of them.\\n- Waves: Now beaches with waves :D\\n- Better horses: Now horses go faster than you by foot, something that makes kind of sense.\\n- Less agressive animals: Just makes less agressive small animals like rats or crabs. Was kind of ridiculous to see a crab trying to fight imperial soldiers.\\n- Hunter\\'s Reward - Better prices: Able to skin and sell pelts for a reasonable price in case you wanna play as a hunter.\\n- iNeed: To eat, to drink and to Sleep is now necessary and rewardable.\\n- Holidays: Skyrim has special days like our christmas and all that stuff\\n- Expanded Carriage Service: Carriage service in places where you couldn\\'t find them before, like Morthal or Dawnstar.\\n- Rich merchants of Skyrim: Merchants have more money to buy, meaning that you don\\'t need to walk around all skyrim to sell the stuff. (1000 septims was humiliating for a merchant TBH)\\n- Run for your lives: When a dragon attacks people run off instead of trying to smack the dragon.\\n- When vampires attack: Same with vampires\\n- The Paarthurnax Dilemma: Lets you spare his life. \\n- Hold border banners: Banners from different holds are placed on their borders, pretty simple but cool enough for me.\\n- Immersive patrols SE: Since there\\'s a civil war going on, it\\'s weird not to see any battle along the way until you join one of the sides of the war. With this mod you can find these fights while you walk around. Make other kind of patrols available, like the dawnguard.\\n- Practice Dummies: You can use them to improve your skill till level 30 out of 100. That means that you don\\'t need to deal with badass foes with the skill \"i barely know how to hold the sword\".\\n- Mammoth Pelts: You can skin mammoths, something that i still don\\'t get why it wasn\\'t allowed in the original game.\\n- Dog followers are Huskies: Makes it cooler and makes sense too since Skyrim is the north.\\n- Whistle: Lets you whistle to the horse to make him come over, avoiding to search for the damn horse every time he flees from a battle.\\n- NPC\\'s Run and Walk at your pace:  exactly what the mod says.\\n- Animal poverty: Animals don\\'t drop gold. Like they have a bank account or something...\\n- Immersive armors: adds different kind of armors and shields. The more smithing perks you got the more armors will show up. (Showed in auxiliary armors)\\n- MamTuskPowderGrind: You can grind  mammoth tusk to make its powder, an ingredient that was so hard to find and wasn\\'t allowed (don\\'t know why) to make it out from the normal tusks.\\n- Fantasy Soundtrack Project: Replaces the original music OR adds its songs to the original music. Just necessary if after all these hundreds of hours you got tired of the original one.\\n- Enhaced blood textures: MORE BLOOD!\\n- Skyland: Landscape texture overhaul\\n- Static Mesh Improvement Mod: Better textures for interiors.\\n- Skyrim better roads: More and better textures for main roads.\\n- Verdant: Better textures for grass.\\n- Blacksmith forge water fix se: Makes the water from the blacksmith look real. Yeah... once you realize you need it.\\n- Realistic water two: Improves A LOT water textures and effects.\\n- Open cities Skyrim: No loading screen when you get into a city (this needs a patch to work with Ineed mod)\\n- Immersive Citizens: their behaviour and dialogues are more real. (needs a patch to work with Open cities)\\nBTW, i got them in this order and all of them work properly\\n\\nSome of the mods are only available on nexusmods, which leads me to my final advise: Download the mod \"noble skyrim\". Improves SO MUCH the city textures and buildings. There\\'s just one problem, it has been ported to special edition but still remains on original skyrim from nexus: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/45807/? \\nThere are two options, wait till it\\'s completely ported to SSE or download it manually from original skyrim and install it manually from Nexus Mod Manager as well. It won\\'t show up on the list, but it will be there, so don\\'t worry. There\\'s a patch as well to work properly with SMIM mod (Static Meshes).\\n\\nEDIT: I strongly recommend another mod that i just found out! it\\'s called: Amazing Follower Tweaks SSE, and i found it on nexusmods. Short description: you can have more than 1 follower (which is nice since Campfire mod adds tents up to 4 people) and it\\'s possible to tweak each follower as you wish, like creating different sets of outfits depending on if they are outside or inside a city, setting primary spells, weapons, THEY CAN EVEN RIDE HORSES NOW!! and some other stuff. Check it out here: http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4340/?\\n(I got it placed after \"the paarthumax dilemma\")',\n",

       "  'review': \"The year was 2011 - a young gimpyboy89 was excited to play Skyrim on release day after having been years late to the world of Oblivion. Gimpygirl90 suggested that we get a pizza and dive into the new entry in the Elder Scrolls series, and for the next hundred hours I ignored college classes and explored every mountain/cave/ruin I could find.\\n\\nNow 11 years later I decided to take a trip down memory lane. Some things have changed, gimpygirl90 is now gimpywife90 and we have three gimpykids, but Skyrim still holds all the magic and wonder that it did 11 years ago. This game is truly a high water mark for the industry and if by some horrible course of events you've never played it yet, you owe it to yourself to experience the grandure of this epic game.\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]\\nUnless there is a mod exclusive to Skyrim Legendary Edition, go buy Skyrim Special Edition. SE is more stable than LE because it is 64-bit & DirectX 11 while LE is 32-bit & DirectX 9 [b][i](in layman\\'s terms: You will experience fewer crashes on SE than on LE)[/i][/b]. And if you haven\\'t played Skyrim yet, you have done well to avoid Todd Howard for 9 years (and counting). Amazing first time RPG experience & one of the biggest modding scenes to date leading to potentially thousands of hours of replayability.\\n\\n[h1]GENRE:[/h1]\\nOpen-world fantasy RPG\\n\\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\\nAfter the introductory cutscene, you are free to roam the map of Skyrim as you please. Visit various undiscovered map locations teeming with wild and dangerous enemies both human and non-human. Build the character and play style you want to: become a mage and harness the powers of destruction magic to burn your opponents alive or manipulate their minds with illusion magic; or become a fearsome warrior who travels the world in heavy armor and swings a mighty axe to decapitate everyone in sight; or let\\'s be real and accept the reality that in every playthrough you will somehow, whether intentionally or not, end up playing a stealth archer build who abuses the vanilla sneak system and headshots enemies from a mile away without being detected.\\n\\nJoin various factions ranging from the honorable Companions of Whiterun to the mysterious Dark Brotherhood. Complete quests to obtain various riches ranging from special enchanted weapon artifacts to brand new player housing. Follow the main quest and find out what is the reason behind dragons returning to Skyrim and what how exactly you are involved with everything.\\n\\n[h1]GRAPHICS:[/h1]\\nSkyrim SE was released in 2016 as a remaster of Skyrim LE with added graphical features including godrays, dynamic DOF, and environmental effects. There isn\\'t any brand new vanilla content, but the land of Skyrim sure looks better in vanilla SE than in vanilla LE. The game has a big map filled with different landscapes from grassy plains to bustling Nordic cities and of course snowy mountains that seem to climb all the way to the stars. There is plenty of variety in the world of Skyrim: different weapons, armors, wildlife, enemy types, dungeon types etc. \\n\\nIn terms of performance, [b]vanilla[/b] SE runs much better than LE and is practically crash free since it isn\\'t restricted by a small memory block like LE (that is not to say that the game [i]won\\'t[/i] crash if you mod it with 400 mods). \\n\\nIn any event, if you don\\'t like something about the graphics, the issue is easily fixable through modding (replacing textures, adding new visual effects, adding an ENB, etc.). \\n\\n[h1]STORY:[/h1]\\nIn the beginning, you find yourself as a prisoner in classic Elder Scrolls fashion. For some reason, you are on a cart heading towards a chopping block where everyone in the cart, including yourself, is about to be executed. Your execution is rudely interrupted by a renegade dragon who mysteriously attacks everyone on sight, but fortunately it grants you freedom. After escaping, your story is up to you to make or discover.\\n\\nPursue the main quest and find out what that dragon was doing at the execution and what your role in these events is. Or choose to pursue other faction quests and enter the ranks of various guilds around Skyrim. Or ignore everything and just wander in a direction until you reach a new unvisited landmark and explore what lies ahead.\\n\\n[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]\\n•Skyrim is reputable for having a big, open-world where one tagline for advertisement was \"if you see it, you can go to it\". In most cases, this is true (so long as you are within the map of Skyrim\\'s borders). If you see a mountain in the distance, by all means you can probably jump your way up to it. Thus, there is a large amount of freedom in the game for you to go wherever and do whatever. It is highly likely that you will stumble upon something interesting while straying away from a main road or following a divergent path away from your intended destination.\\n\\n•The non-radiant (non-repeatable) quests in Skyrim are pretty good. There are many stories for you to unravel and be a part of. If you are finding a questline to be a bit boring, you are (for the most part) free to leave and return to the quest at your own disposal in the future.\\n\\n•You really are free to build the class/playstyle you want to; if you want to get better at Skill x, just do Skill x-related tasks and your levels will improve. Just consider not playing a stealth archer for once. Or don\\'t.\\n\\n•[b]Mods[/b]. Modding Skyrim becomes its own game once you enter the wormhole of modding. If you can imagine it, someone probably made a mod for it. Whether you want to retexture a city, revamp the game\\'s perk system, add a custom follower, or change all dragons into Macho Man Randy Savage, there\\'s a mod for nearly everything imaginable. Ask anyone who has modded the game and they will probably tell you \"I\\'ve spent more time modding the game than playing it at this point\". Most, if not all, mods are available in both LE and SE, and certain mods are still in the process of being converted from LE to SE if they haven\\'t already been converted.\\n\\n[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]\\n•In modern day standards, the combat of Skyrim is pretty awful, particularly the melee. Close-quarters melee combat doesn\\'t feel impactful in that generally you swing a weapon at an enemy and unless it is a power attack, you won\\'t really get a reaction out of them like a wince or a flinch. The melee feels very \"floaty\" and otherwise unimpressive.\\n\\n•I think most players agree that the Civil War storyline overall isn\\'t very interesting/is pretty buggy in the vanilla game.\\n\\n•You will probably encounter various NPC\\'s that share voice actors given that there are so many NPC\\'s (usually given backstories) in the game and a limited amount of voice actors during the making of Skyrim. Although usually the important NPC\\'s are uniquely voiced which is a plus.\\n\\n•The modding process can be pretty overwhelming to newcomers. Veterans will tell you to test mods one at a time because if you should choose to install 10 mods at once and the game crashes to the desktop at launch, you have to go back and figure out which mod was the cause and why that mod specifically is the problem. You shouldn\\'t expect all mods to be compatible with each other so oftentimes you have to decide which mods you want and which mods you don\\'t need.\\n\\n[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]\\n9/10\\n\\nSkyrim is a timeless game that continues to live on because you can replay it forever, but differently each time as people continue to make mods for the game and you continue to add to your modlist and get sucked back in for one more playthrough.\\n\\n[quote] Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. \"Let\\'s be honest, I only wrote this review for awards\" is a waste of everyone\\'s time.

       "  'review': '2013, my first time playing Skyrim:\\n\\nOn my way to Bleak Falls Barrow, I was attacked by a group of vampires. I managed to stave them off, but I contracted vampirism without realizing it. About a week later, I came out of a dungeon only to be attacked by some peasants calling me a vampire. \\n\\nConfused, I went to Whiterun in search of a cure. However, as soon as I arrived, I was met by a volley of arrows being showered at me by the town guard. At this point, I had done some quests for the companions, so I made a run to Jorrvaskr in search of someone who still may be my friend. The guards chased me throughout the city, with several of them hot on my tail, I burst through the doors of Jorrvaskr and met the companions. I was never so happy to hear Njada Stonearm call me useless. This feeling of relief was short-lived, however, as a company of guards suddenly entered the room. My friends all drew their swords and came to my defense. After a lengthy battle, the guards all lay dead on the ground.\\n\\nBefore I could celebrate, all of the companions went outside. Wondering where they were going, I decided to follow them. As I stepped outside into the harsh sunlight, I witnessed a massacre. The companions were murdering every hostile NPC in Whiterun. Heimskr was the first to fall as Aela rammed her sword straight through his gullet. The rest of the townspeople fled in terror, but it was no use. Belethor, Adrianne, even Nazeem, they all were mercilessly slaughtered by the companions. \\n\\nAs I walked through the blood-soaked streets, I found a single survivor: Brenuin, the town drunk and one of my only friends in Whiterun. He was hiding, crouched down next to the cow behind a house. I decided to sit down next to him, when I saw Farkas, axe in hand, coming into the pen. With a deep, gutteral voice, he says, \"Where are you?\" he turns the corner and sees Brenuin cowering behind the cow, \"Ha! Found you!\" he yells. \\n\\nBrenuin screams for mercy, but it\\'s too late. Farkas\\'s massive axe comes down on Brenuin\\'s skull, splitting it in two, as the drunk falls on the floor in a puddle of his own blood. \\n\\nIt was then I realized that I would be playing this game for years to come.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The Canadian winter of 2011: I remember it well.\\n\\nI walked to the nearest mall (about 4 km away) in 1 foot of snow. The air pierced my skin; -23 degrees celcius the news said in the morning. I couldn\\'t know for sure, I didn\\'t have a cellphone to check the weather. Even if I did, 3G technology was too expensive to use. My iPod touch was the only device available to me and even then, WiFi was negligible. Not many stores hosted WiFi networks back then. I eventually made it to the mall.\\n\\nI walked into the EB games; Xbox 360, Wii and PS3 games lined the walls. There was a small section that sold used games - useless to me. I was here for THE game. I was here for Skyrim. \\n\\nI found the game on a shelf. It called to me. Most would recall seeing the cover saying \\'The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim\\' but all I saw was \\'Play Me!\\'\\n\\nNow, mind you, I had never played an Elder Scrolls game before. I had tried to pirate Morrowind as a 12 year old but failed numerous times. But now I was 18. I was a man. I was set to conquer the beast but little had I known how large the beast would be.\\n\\nI placed the game box on the counter. The cashier, a middle aged man, told me how great my decision was. He was a chubby man, about 5\\' 10\". He lacked hair on the top of his head and his teeth were a little scraggly. But he was civil. I could tell he was an experienced gamer - a veteran of the hobby.\\n\\nHe placed \\'the game\\' in the classical EB Games bag and I was on my way out of the store. By the time I got outside of the mall, night had fallen. Canadian winters are notorious for their short day span. I placed \\'the treasure\\' inside my jacket and zipped it up tight. I could not allow the baby to suffer the same way I did. It needed warmth and care.\\n\\nAs soon as I got home, I popped the game into my Xbox 360. I didn\\'t know what to expect. What is The Elder Scrolls? Why was the middle aged man so hyped about the game? I got my answer. As soon as I was being dragged in a cart to my execution, I understood why this was to be the game of games.\\n\\nNow it is the year 2019. I am no longer the fresh-faced 18 year old. I have experienced life. I have been through hell. However, every time I launch this game, I am the wide-eyed 18 year old again: no obligations to anyone but myself. \\n\\nIf you have never played this game in the past, don\\'t bother. The graphics haven\\'t aged well (although they were premium for the time). The user interface is still sleek, however. If you can get past the graphics, animation and combat; the stories in the game are unforgettable. I wish I could go back in time to the winter of 2011. I wish I could forget about this game so I could experience it again. \\n\\nSkyrim set the bar for what modern games should be. It not only deserves a 10/10 but it deserves a place in our history books. There is so much content to experience in the game that you could play it for YEARS and still not have experienced everything in it. Why do you think I bought the game again? For fun? \\n\\nI\\'m going back to finish the game once and for all.',\n",

I go to put on breakfast. I turn on the stove, it runs Skyrim, which is weird because it's a gas stove with no screen display. I go to work, spending 15 hours a day writing clickbait articles about Elder Scrolls VI. My boss looms over my shoulder, barking orders at me. Turns out, it's actually Todd Howard. He asks me if I've bought this game again this week. 'Yup', he smirks, 'Stealth archer again, I bet'. I nod. \\n\\nI go home and think about how this was the coolest thing on earth circa 2012, and even my grandma said she needed a knee reconstruction from an archery accident or something.

You can download expansions (Yes, literally entire expansions), overhauls to the skill system, combat, npc, town, weather (including amazing storms and blizzard blindness!) and countless other game overhauls that add massive immersion and realism. \\n\\nYou can even start in a random location and be given a (partly)randomised backstory and set of gear to match it. In fact if you can think of a reasonable addition or change, there's a good chance that someone may have already made it. I've heard the figure of 80,000 mentioned when asked how many mods there are and tbh I can believe that. \\n\\nEdit: I've spotted a few people saying that the mods keep breaking after an official SSE update. There's a solution to that and I've followed this procedure myself  after being irritated by the official updates and it works perfectly. I hope this helps a few of you out.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=12&v=3gAiLABNoIA\",\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] NOTE: I am aware this review needs an edit. I will do it ASAP [/h1]\\n\\nThere are so many reviews of Skyrim, so you probably know what it\\'s about.\\n\\nThe real question is: Should you buy this or the original Skyrim?\\nHere are some key points to consider:\\n\\n-It is much cheaper than Skyrim with DLC\\'s\\n\\n-It comes bundled with ALL the DLC\\'s from the original Skyrim\\n\\n-Comes with a built-in mod manager intended to be used by mods from Bethesda.net\\n\\n-Saves are reworked - you get seperate save files for each character you create, and there are seperate saves for modded characters, so it is easy to revert back to a time when you didn\\'t break skyrim with mods!\\n\\n-It is (as of writing this review) LESS modable than the original Skyrim. SKSE has not yet been updated for a 64-bit version and is a dependancy for a lot of the more complex mods.\\n\\n-The old 3.3GB ram restricion has been removed causing fewer crashes due to running out of memory and boosting the FPS in large battles.\\n\\n-Stable Alt+Tab! It no longer puts your mouse pointer on-screen after an Alt-Tab (like in the original Skyrim), resulting in fewer restarts and less annoyance.\\n\\n-Updated to 64bit, much more stable in general and a boon to mods in the long run.\\n\\n-Rain and snow now don\\'t pass through rocks and other scenery, increasing a bit of immersion and making the terrain feel more \"real\".\\n\\n-Added God Rays, forrests look much prettier now.\\n\\n-Depth of field, can be a little annoying in open areas, but makes conversations with NPC\\'s a look lot nicer.\\n\\n-Sleek black new launcher, removed the \\'Data Files\\' option and moved it to the main menu.\\n\\n-Slightly better looking bethesda logo on startup.\\n\\n-The poor sound quality was fixed in a patch, the music sounds the same as the original Skyrim (which is in this case, a good thing).\\n\\n\\nSo, do I recommend it? \\n\\nIf you have never played/owned a version of skyrim before, there is no reason not to buy it. It\\'s cheaper ($5 for all the DLC\\'s) and is more stable.\\n\\nIf you own Skyrim and all the DLC\\'s, there is not much reason to buy this for full price - wait for a sale if you want it (unless money isn\\'t a big deal to you, in that case, buy away!).\\n\\nIf you own the original Skyrim but with no DLC\\'s, then I reccomend it because it is cheaper than buying all the DLC\\'s for it.\\n\\nThank you for reading my review! I\\'m new to this kind of thing, suggest some things I can do better in the comments!',\n",

       "  'review': \"Instead of going into the reasons that make Skyrim so good (which, lets be real you already know because its f*cking SKYRIM!)\\nI'll tell you my Skyrim story..\\n\\nSo I downloaded and started playing the pirated copy of Skyrim on my old potato pc long ago, after about a dozen hours or so I was completely hooked and fell in love with the game. Something about Skyrim just clicked with me and I kinda felt guilty playing it for free. That day I uninstalled Skyrim and made a promise to myself that when I get a good PC and some money, I'll buy the game and continue my journey.\\n\\nTime passed by and I got a new PC so I finally decided to buy Skyrim.. and I'll be damned, the magic is still there. I finished the campaign after getting side tracked like a million times and loved every second of it. It still feels like there's so much more to do and explore. It truly is something special and it holds a special place in my heart.\\n\\nP.S: please don't f*ck up TES 6 Todd, please I beg you!\",\n",

I have my doubts that Bethesda actually pays the 3rd party artists anything they remotely deserve. Thank god the homie alerted me about the update prior to me updating the game.

       "  'review': 'I got this for free since I already had Skyrim + all expansions.\\n\\nI\\'d say this is worth buying if:\\n\\n1. You\\'ve never played Skyrim before and you don\\'t know what you\\'re doing.\\n2. You\\'d like to play a prettier version of Skyrim without mods.\\n\\nI personally have spent quite a lot of time on this game already but always fell back to spending more time modding it than actually playing the game. Mods are lots of fun and fix so many issues this game have, there are tons I love and would recommended... But if you\\'re like me and you would like [i]actually finishing[/i] your games, it might be a better idea to play the game vanilla to avoid going insane.\\n\\nThis edition is great for that. You have all those little graphical enhancements built-in and (mostly) glitch free, don\\'t expect anything new content-wise though.\\n\\nIf you already own the base version and didn\\'t get this for free, don\\'t buy it. You can get more or less the same result with mods, spending an extra $50+ on a small visual rework is not worth it.\\n\\nAs for the actual game, I\\'m sure most people know of Skyrim by now so I\\'ll try to avoid the more obvious things:\\n\\nSkyrim is very popular for a reason, it\\'s a great RPG. It\\'s a great game and the amount of content is insane, definitely a game  a lot of people can sink a lot of hours into. Great as it is however, it\\'s also full of flaws. Filled. A foundation of mistakes. Oblivion and Skyrim (I haven\\'t played Morrowind very much so I can\\'t really comment on it) are what I\\'ve considered my favorite video games for a long time and as much as I would like to say they are perfect, there are so many things about them that frustrate me and make the game not as enjoyable as it could have been.\\n\\nThe main issue with Skyrim is that it fails to innovate. It wasn\\'t as much of an issue in 2011 but seeing the game getting re-re-re-re-released and seeing what Fallout 4 ended up being makes me extremely worried for the future of the series. I think the biggest problem is that the game is founded on old mentalities, old video game design. It\\'s as if most of the game is the way it is because \"that\\'s how video games are\" than because it makes sense.\\n\\nThere are countless mechanics that are tracked but cannot be seen, the interface and stats are extremely lackluster. I can understand the argument for \"Immersion\" but in a game that boasts an incredible amount of content, not being able to track my progress drives me nuts. Most of the interface doesn\\'t work well with KBM and was clearly designed with consoles in mind. Not being able to sort through your inventory, through storage etc. There is so much about this game that almost forces you to be disorganised and inneficient.\\n\\nEngine-wise, while there is a significant leap in visuals, the Special Edition JUST now fixed the dreaded and ancient alt-tab issue. The game doesn\\'t run particurlarly well, never properly supported borderless windowed, never supported refresh rates above 60 FPS without messing up physics. Every interior is instanced. Even if they\\'re fast you constantly have loading screens.\\n\\nYour first couple of hours will be filled with wonder and a thirst for exploration you can never quench. You will however realize that there isn\\'t much more to discover than in a randomly generated game after that, unless you are very dense. Most of the loot is randomly generated, enemies respawn, so many locations re-use the same asset to the point where they look nearly identical (when they kept boasting about the fact that each dungeon had been hand-crafted... they just failed to mention that hand-crafted means a couple rooms manually paired together in different orders). Unique assets are so rare that you feel like you\\'ve discovered something amazing when you see one, even if it\\'s insignificant.\\n\\nBack on efficiency; This game wants you to be inneficient so bad. You can pick up everything. Most people that never played a game like this will [i]want[/i] to pick up a bunch of stuff because they assume it come in handy, to resell it or whatever. The truth is, there is no point. Most of the stuff in this game is useless. In fact, even the things that [i]should[/i] be useful is useless. I\\'ve only made one character on Skyrim SE and it was my sixth in total. It\\'s the first character I\\'ve decided to play efficiently and complete everything with.\\n\\nThere is a very important concept where items will have more or less value depending on their weight. It\\'s very simple but most people won\\'t think about it. All you have to do is divide the value in gold by the weight to get the septims:weight ratio and you\\'ll soon realize that a 30 weight mace that\\'s worth 300 gold is actually garbage compared to something that\\'s 1 weight and over 10 gold. Because of that, gems and potions are always worth picking up and will have insane ratios whereas most equipment is useless. I know it\\'s stupid but the moment you start planing what you pick up with that in mind, you can basically just run through everything and ignore most of the loot yet become rich.\\n\\nSome quests are fun and interesting. The rest you wonder why they\\'re there at all. Why would you spend so much time completing a tedious quest that hardly has more to it than something out of an MMO when the reward is the amount of gold you would get selling some random trinket you\\'ll find just about anywhere. Dialogues are neither interesting or engaging, they\\'ll often drag on for too long and your \"choices\" are only really there to give you a voice because they usually change very little to how things unfold. This honestly ruins so many of the actually interesting, fun or original quests in the game. There is so much content that could have been cut without affecting the quality. The guild questlines and daedric quests are some of the only memorable ones.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, the game suffers so much from letting you do whatever you want and go wherever you please. For two reasons:\\n\\n1. Most of the game has to scale in difficulty based on your progression in the game, which results in weird things like overpowered wolves (not as much of an issue in Skyrim than it was in Oblivion).\\n2. You are constantly being sent all around the world without ever feeling like you\\'re \"done\" with anything.\\n\\nFreedom is something a lot of people like in a game. However, I believe that if you need to rely on scaling difficulty, you haven\\'t designed the game well. I wish some areas were more dangerous than others. I wish I couldn\\'t go places because the enemies are too tough. I wish I\\'d face an enemy that makes me go \"WHAT THE FUCK\" and only come back once I feel I\\'ve become strong enough. Those take away from the experience so much for me. Being allowed to do whatever you want is one thing, being [i]able[/i] to is another.\\n\\nOne last thing: The combat is not interesting, no matter how you see it. That\\'s what you spend the most time doing and it\\'s just not fun. You end up cheesing it all the time because the tools you\\'re giving just don\\'t really work that well. Progression sounds exciting but in practice it\\'s boring (spells are a good example). By the time you\\'re that strong, the game won\\'t be challenging anyway and if it is, it won\\'t feel like a challenge, it\\'ll feel like a chore.\\n\\nOne game that fixes nearly all these issues for me is The Witcher 3. I found it better in nearly every aspects and it makes me sad because I love the elder scrolls. Seeing Fallout 4 shows me that Bethesda is not willing to re-think how they make games and what makes them fun. I expect TES VI to be the same I\\'ve seen with their games since 2006. I still expect loading when I go inside houses. I still expect face close ups when I talk to people. I still expect a clunky first-person combat system.\\n\\nNevertheless and surprisingly enough, I still recommend this game. Play it! It\\'s fun for the most part.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After investing 250+ hours in this game & getting 100% achievements, I believe that I am worthy enough to write this review.\\n\\nBefore going forward, I'd like to tell that:\\n\\n1. I never played any Elder Scroll's game before\\n2. I took 250+ hours for a single Nord level 81 Male character.\\n3. I played Skyrim vanilla i.e. (without any mods). I was under the impression that mods will disable achievements & I wanted to complete it fully. I'd love to play it again with mods as well as with a different race now. Unfortunately I have a job & badly wanted to start Witcher 3 so I'll give this a miss. Maybe after my retirement, I'll come back to it. \\n4. I've never killed a chicken in Riverwood but can't tolerate Nazeem & his cloud district.\\n\\nComing back to the game, It has some issues and bugs but it is one of the best RPG game ever. It looks georgeous even as unmodded & I've seen some fabulous artwork with mods. Gameplay is fantastic.\\nI believe that the magic portion of this game is a little underwhelming. Almost everyone beomes a Jack of all trades sneaky archer in the end which is bad. I've been guilty of doing that too.\\nThe main storyline is a bit OK-ish but there are various different factions & tonnes of side quests which will engage you for atleast a year.\\nI've completed every side-quest in this game including the DLCs, collected almost every valuable item and now my quest log is almost empty barring a few radiant quests.\\nComing back to the DLCs, Solestime & Dawnguard are fantastic add-ons to the already  exceptional game. Although I believe the third DLC was a bit boring except being able to adopt a child which was good.\\nI can't believe Steam has not included crafting Badges for this game keeping in mind that OldRim has that feature. Come-on Steam :(\\nI believe this was one of the best game ever created keeping in mind that It came way back in 2011.\\n\\nIn short, It was the best single player Time-waster game & My first love for RPG games !!!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'This isn\\'t really a review, so much as it is just me giving my personal thoughts and experiences with this game.\\n\\nSkyrim has been my all-time favorite game since I first got it in 2013. I got it on Xbox 360 at first, and no joke, it was the only game I played from that point on. I didn\\'t even consider playing anything else. Then my dad got me my first PC on my birthday, and there was no going back from that point on.\\n\\nThis game was there for me when I needed it most. I was bullied a lot at school and had abysmal grades. I had no friends and felt like no one could understand me, so I kept my feelings to myself. I was an angry, impulsive kid with a very short fuse, so I often exploded for little to no reason over the smallest things. I was also very violent at home, but I\\'ll not get into that. Skyrim was the only thing I looked forward to after a terrible day at school. I was very suicidal during that time, and Skyrim was the only thing that I had going for me; the only thing keeping me from death were thoughts like \"but I haven\\'t found the Deathbrand armor set yet\", and the like. You could say that Skyrim was the only reason I had to live at the time.\\n\\nWhenever I was feeling angry, sad, or generally in a bad mood, I would boot up the game and all my problems would go away. I would play for long hours, often skipping meals and losing out on sleep. This gave off the impression that I was addicted to Skyrim in particular and my parents blamed it for causing all of my mood swings and violent behavior, so they tried to limit how much I played the game. The final straw came when I ran away from school sometime in 2016. They took away my PC under my teacher\\'s orders, who kept it at her house. After that, my life began to spiral downhill, as life threw at me harder challenges than ever before, the impact of which only magnified as I had lost the only place where I could express my feelings in the only place I felt safe in and escape from the real world. You could say that I lost the only friend I had. Eventually, I got my life under control, but I would be lying if I said that I wasn\\'t always thinking about having another adventure in Tamriel, downloading a mod that I had always wanted, and generally just getting away from the world, if only for a moment. I still wonder how much easier my life would have been if I still had this game to keep me company through all those years.\\n\\nEventually, I bought the Special Edition in mid-2019, and I had never looked back. This game is just how I remembered it from nearly 8 years ago. I\\'m not the type of guy to cry or show any sort of emotion easily, even in private, but when I booted up the game for the first time in years, all those memories just came back to me and I had an almost overwhelming need to tear up. Even as I\\'m writing this down, I can feel my heartstrings being pulled as I reflect as to how much this game has affected me as a person and helped me throughout my life. This game and/or the memories I\\'ve had with it have been with me for the entirety of my teenage life and for the latter part of my adolescence, and now that I\\'m 18 years old and still playing the game on a daily basis (of course, with breaks in-between), I\\'m ready to experience this game like never before, because the modding community had an explosion of incredible mods since 2020, what with the rise of mods like Beyond Skyrim, among others.\\n\\nI would like to thank Skyrim for all that it has given me. Through the good, the bad, and the absolutely unbearable parts of my life, you were always there for me when I needed you most (which is more than can be said for a lot of people in my life). You\\'ve never betrayed me, never made me angry (other than rare cases of rage quit, which comes with all games), never once made me feel like I\\'m worthless. Quite the contrary, in fact, considering that most people in the game tend to praise you as Dragonborn and/or as leader of all the guilds in the province ;). I would also like to thank Bethesda and our Lord and Savior Godd Howard himself for making this game. Despite all the crap we give you, you guys rock!\\n\\nThanks for coming to my TED Talk.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Basically the same as the original Skyrim. The only major differences are:\\n\\n+ 64 bit engine rework. This largely means that it can use more RAM, and not run into memory issues quite so often as the original Skyrim did. This is, in theory, good for modders, as they can add significantly more content into the worldspace without running into the 3.3GB limit. \\n\\n+ Runs a little more smoothly and stably. I haven\\'t noticed any crashes yet. Framerate is significantly more stable on lower end hardware than original Skyrim.\\n\\n+ Due to engine overhauls and increased memory, larger scale battles are possible. Of course, these aren\\'t implemented; but in original Skyrim, if you spawn significant numbers of NPCs that are in combat you may notice some simply don\\'t fight back. In Skyrim Special Edition, these extra NPCs can fight properly.\\n\\n+ Graphics are slightly improved, and a few bugs are fixed. Textures are somewhat higher resolution - don\\'t know just how much, and i believe meshes are slightly improved in detail as well? Z-Fighting, a long standing engine issue where two textures overlapped (especially noticeable with distance mountains) and the renderer couldn\\'t decide which one to show on top, resulting in rapid flicker between the two textures.\\n\\n+ It\\'s Skyrim. It\\'s incredibly fun, and will drain all your free time. It\\'s made even better by modding, but this leads on to the next point.\\n\\n- There are very few mods available for it. Much of the original Skyrim\\'s modding community relied on a script extender called SKSE, by the wonderful folks over at Silverlock, known for their script extender plugins for various Gamebryo/Creation engine games by Bethesda. As a result, while big name unscripted mods (ie. texture replacements, mesh replacements, and certain mods that modify existing data without relying on scripting) have been ported, there is a significant gap in user-friendliness as a result. \\n\\n- The user interface has not been overhauled one bit. It is still the clunky, designed-for-console, made by crab people for crab people mess that it always was, with cascading menus. For original Skyrim, there was an incredible mod called SkyUI, which used SKSE to entirely overhaul the menu systems to a more mouse-and-keyboard friendly setup. SkyUI also created a \"mod configuration menu\", which allowed users with mods to, well, modify various parameters in the mods without having to use a scripted item that gets added to the player\\'s inventory, like in the days of Oblivion. Skyrim Special Edition entirely lacks SkyUI, as SKSE64 is still in development, and SkyUI is unlikely to be ported as it is a finished project.\\n\\n- There is no new content. The three DLC packs, Hearthfire, Dragonborn and Dawnguard all come bundled with SSE, but there is no added content by bethesda. Well, that\\'s a lie, some items are available when they were not previously, like the nigh-useless Torturer\\'s Hood. But there are no new quests, nothing.\\n\\n- Graphically speaking, SSE looks like the original version of Skyrim with a couple of basic graphical improvement mods added, stuff like Purity, SMIM (static mesh improvement mod) and similar. It is starting to look somewhat dated, as the game itself is six years old now (I know!)\\n\\nIn short:\\n\\nBuy this if you want slightly improved graphics and stability, with a smaller modding community that is still struggling to get off the ground. It\\'s still selling for $39USD last I checked, where original Skyrim is $34USD for the base game and $55USD for the game plus DLC. \\n\\nSo yeah, it\\'s cheaper than original Skyrim, but it is also hampered by the main thing that makes Bethesda games long lasting; its moddability.\\n\\nHonestly, I\\'d say it\\'s worth paying more for the original game for its extensive library of mods, but if you aren\\'t a person into modding or one who hasn\\'t played Skyrim before (those exist?), get this.',\n",

       "  'review': '\"Psst! Hey. I Know Who You Are. Hail Sithis!\\nPart A) Very important: The Non-special edition is hidden from steam store. Here is the link: It is not cheaper anymore because they do not offer discounts on it. \\nBoth the Non-special edition and Special Edition have mods that are Free.\\n\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/226880/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dragonborn/\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/211720/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Dawnguard/\\nhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/220760/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim__Hearthfire/\\n\\n\\nI have over 900 hours on that version!\\nConsole commands on the Non-Special version also do not disable achievements and neither do mods! For the Special Edition you have to install other mods that re-enable achievements (please see below)\\n\\nPart B) Funny Lines: It has the funniest lines:\\n\"Do You Get To The Cloud District Very Often? Oh, What Am I Saying, Of Course You Don\\'t.\"  I am sure Nazir has not been to the cloud district as well!\\n\"You\\'ll Make A Fine Rug, Cat!\" (There is discrimination in Skyrim)\\n\"Those Warriors From Hammerfell? They\\'ve Got Curved Swords. Curved. Swords.\"(I want one!)\\n\"Psst! Hey. I Know Who You Are. Hail Sithis!\\nIron Sword Huh? What Are You Killing? Butterflies? I agree with you\\nWhy The Elven Blade, Huh? Nord Steel Not Good Enough For You? My response: Geez why not? It is lighter right?\\n\"If I Had A Sister, I\\'d Sell Her In A Second\" said Belethor.   My response: You Greedy Loser!\\n\"By Shor, You\\'re Hauling Around A Lot Of Junk\"     LOL Junk in the trunk if you play a female character!\\nRiekling warrior \"You Bring Red Grass we Dance\".  Red Grass? Don\\'t you mean Green Grass?\\n\\nPart C) One of the best RPGS of all times with the best sound track. When I was under a loss of stress from work and school, I would play this game at night during dinner and it would help me forget my problems. You can get lost in the game for sure and explore the best places in Skyrim. (I have played the non-special version) please see the link above. \\nPlease listen to the soundtrack by Lindsey sterling: \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSLPH9d-jsI&ab_channel=LindseyStirling\\nA tip: There are caves where you can hunt vampires down those are my absolutely favs!\\n\\nPart D) The Non-special edition even ran on my crappy ACER Laptop with Intel HD graphics! So very optimizable! \\n\\nPart E)  My complaint: Stop please with the MMO crap and make the new Elder Scroll VI. A New Elder Scroll is long overdue now. Have you even started working on it? You can make mods in special edition for free (some of them)\\n\\nPart F) Achievements work. However, apparently mods disable achievements. Please download this engine fix mods (eg: \"SSE Engine Fixes (skse64 plugin)\") which in can also re-enable achievements\\nNote in the comments someone said: SE is 64 bit and oldrim is 32 which is SE has better performance and it almost never crashes even with over 100 mods. \\n\\nPart G) With mods amazing scenes! Try this location with mods: eldergleam sanctuary\\nThis is another location here\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2397136836\\n\\nBetter funny lines than Oblivion but these were my favourites\\n“Why do khajiits lick their butts?” “To get the taste of khajiit cooking out of their mouths! Ha ha ha!”\\n\\nOwyn (Arena Quatermaster): \"I heard a rumor that you\\'re an idiot. Any truth to that?\"\\n\\nI\\'m Mirabelle Monet. I run the Fo\\'c\\'s\\'le, a boarding house for sailors.

       "  'review': 'Pre ordered Vault edition. Downloaded early access for campaign. Played for 2 1/2 hours and the game crashed. Rebooted. ACCOUNT PERMANENTLY BANNED... Excuse me? Contacted Blizzard. Sent me to Activision. Repealed the ban to Activison. Denied for \" Unauthorized use of software\" and it is a PERMANENT ACTIVISION BAN. I\\'ve never cheated & I wouldn\\'t even know how to... I have no access to anything now...Oh and they also gladly took my $100 dollars that is non refundable after 2 hours of gameplay. Imagine that. The game is bugged, the servers are awful, and they have no care for their customers.\\n\\n11/6/2022 Update: This thread is amazing. I haven\\'t laughed that hard in awhile. Thank you for taking the time to comment. The COD community is hilarious. So let me fill everyone in on what happened and what I have discovered. I originally purchased the game on battle.net which is when the inital perm ban occured. I left the review on here first because it\\'s the only place to do so. I reached out to Activision numerous times and had 0 luck. No information. You can\\'t even talk to a person who works there. When I repealed the ban it was instantly revoked and I received an automated response. Once the Ban is enforced it is permanent and there is nothing you can do about it. I requested a refund and was denied as well because on the battle.net servers I had logged over 2 hours of gameplay (OBVIOUSLY ONLY CAMPAIGN SINCE IT WAS EARLY ACCESS) Also this is why Blizzard was contacted because the link under the account ban takes you to Blizzard. I was mad, but wanted to play the campaign so I purchased the game a second time on steam and created a new Activision account. I know steam is great with refunds if you haven\\'t played 2+ hours (hence why 1.7 hours is logged) It banned me right at 1.7 hours. So now I know that it was a hardware ban. Insane. I requested a refund from Steam and instantly got it back. Whatever, I tried. So after all of this is said and done, 3 weeks later I wake up and decide to re download battle.net and check my account status.....UNBANNED....like nothing ever happened. I have no idea what happened. I saw this thread blowing up and read through all the comments. I checked every program that is installed on my PC that is constantly running in my background task manager. The only one that I read about that could potentially  cause these issues was my CORSAIR ICUE 4 SOFTWARE which is literally the app that makes my RAM sticks the color RED LOL So I uninstalled it to be safe. So now I\\'m back to playing.... what a headache. So I will never know why it happened...but after 3 ish weeks, it disappeared. So for those of you that are dealing with the same issue that really aren\\'t cheaters and didn\\'t do anything wrong I hope this thread helps. Activision won\\'t take responsibility for the fact their anti cheat software is trash and it can\\'t tell the difference between regular software and malicious software (if that really was the issue) Thanks again to those of you with intelligence and actual input who commented.',\n",

I even tried to appeal on their little website, but it got denied of course, by some robot, It\\'s not even read by a human being. Their service is lousy and they try everything in there power to not let REAL people help I even tried calling their company to reach a real person in the support area, instead everything is done by a robot and it directed me to their website, which I already been through. I even tried tweeting it out, so I can get some help but of course, no response, can\\'t even message or reply to ATV support on twitter. Also it\\'s not just me who encountered this issue, it\\'s multiple people, they don\\'t get help at all and they are basically getting scammed. If you own a mouse with advanced settings, (EX) Razer Cortex (What I use), I guess you could get banned because having some extra buttons is cheating apparently. I can\\'t even get a refund so I\\'m stuck with this tumor in my library. One more thing; the people who do get unbanned are usually content creators or people who draw in attention or money to the game from what I have seen. Activision clearly doesn\\'t care about their regular players, because there\\'s over thousands possibly more banned for no reason, just like me. I\\'ve heard of innocent people getting banned in MW2019 and they bought MW2022 and are still banned, it\\'s ridiculous.\\n\\n\\nUpdate 1/7/2023 If you crash don\\'t click \"Verify game files\" it will flag you for data manipulation and you will get permanently banned. The games been out almost half a year and activision hasn\\'t brought this up or even hinted.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Edit (Part 1/2):\\n\\n\\n\\nAs the original announcement was unclear I believe it led to many people believing that they were cancelling the two-year cycle planned for this Call of Duty in the hopes that they would maximise profits in the long term.\\n\\nHowever, this is apparently not the case. It has been clarified that there will be a big midterm DLC advertised for a price that is suggested to be around $70 USD.\\n\\nI will be leaving my review as negative as I do not agree with charging people for DLC as I would assume there are going to be plenty of micro transactions on the store. I do however appreciate that the game is on a two-year cycle and that this was just a misunderstanding.\\n\\nI truly hope the franchise takes this extra amount of time to continuously improve the title so that when it’s time is served it will be remembered and missed dearly.\\n\\nThere is also information/rumours floating around that suggest Sledgehammer will be working on the development of this DLC release. There is no nice way to put this, so I am going to just say straight up, I personally think that this is a foolish decision.\\n\\nI\\'m praying to the high heavens that they decide to remove the price tag for the midterm DLC therefore releasing it for free and that Sledgehammer does\\'t rain too much he\\'ll down on the game when the DLC is to release.\\n\\n\\n\\nEdit (Part 2/2):\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter putting 50+ hours into the game I can strongly affirm that this game feels unfinished, don\\'t get me wrong the gun play, recoil system, movement and sounds are all great. There defiantly needs to be some tweaking here and there however for the most part these things are very nice.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n\\n\\nSkill Based Match Making - Since I hadn\\'t played Call of Duty in a few years I really wanted to see how much Skill Based Match Making played an effect on the game so just to see how it works.. I ended up reverse boosting. Instantly after I was dropping 4 K. D games and having a lot of fun. This changed very fast as the game put me back up into my previous skill bracket where it felt like I was versing a bunch of people just like me. I think this brings out the variety that old match making had and makes it a blander experience, as in you can expect the same thing every time pretty much. Core should have no SBMM and ranked should have SBMM, simple.\\n\\nCo-op - This was something I was looking forward to the most, I love games that have PVE elements in them and this was honestly a huge let down for me. The co-op game modes feel lifeless and repetitive with no sense of wanting to achieve anything more out of them, I get a dumbed down Tom Clancy\\'s Wild lands vibe from the co-op missions but then again, maybe that is just me. It would be nice to see the same co-op inspired game modes from MW3.\\n\\nThe maps - Jesus, I want to like the maps, but they don\\'t feel like Call of Duty maps. I don\\'t know what it is, or how I can describe it but I just don\\'t really think they are any good/ fit well in the game. The only map I find myself enjoying is Mercado Las Almas. I used to be able to pick up Call of Duty\\'s maps pretty fast when I was younger but now they just feel like there are too many rooms, too many floors, some are too wide open, others too restricted. There\\'s just no middle ground.\\n\\nGame modes - Am I the only one that thinks there should be many more game modes. I love playing new games that have creative and fun game modes, it keeps me invested. Not only were we missing hardcore at launch, but we only have the very basic, typical Call of Duty game modes. Spice it up guys, get creative with it, jeez. It would be as simple as putting together a team of creatives solely to come up with new game mode ideas, adding them to an Experimental Playlist and the most played ones get added to Core in the end.\\n\\nGunsmith - I like the idea of the gunsmith, I just think this was poorly executed. It would be good to have this redone so it is easier to navigate and it is also more informative on what certain things do in terms of the pros and cons.\\n\\nUI - I\\'m not going to put much in here because anyone with half a brain cell can tell the UI is way too busy and complex for anyone to appreciate.\\n\\nPerks - I don\\'t mind the perk system too much, however I think we should be earner perks a lot faster, especially when playing the objective.\\n\\n\\n\\nConclusion: \\n\\n\\n\\nThere are other more popular things in the gaming industry now, whether it be Warzone (Battle Royale) or DMZ (Survival Scav) and its not hard to tell that they don\\'t put the same love and creativity into the regular multiplayer experience as they once did. \\n\\nThese other game modes bring in players by the thousands and that also means money by the thousands, so you bet when it comes down to it, they\\'ll be releasing a rushed multiplayer and most likely a rushed War zone and DMZ for the best chance of seeing their game thrive when it comes to having a big player base and maximising profits.\\n\\nI\\'m not going to lie, I do hope they use this extra time of the two-year cycle to add in better maps and to improve the core experience in general as I have never been a big fan of BR, but if they don\\'t, it wouldn\\'t be a surprise at all.\\n\\nThere has always been something to complain about when it comes to Call of Duty, it\\'s not hard to find people ranting about the OG Call of Duty\\'s on YouTube when they originally came out around ten years ago or so.\\n\\nHowever, when it comes down to it MWII truly does feel like an Early Access game in a lot of aspects.\\n\\n\\n\\n(You may find my original review below for the lols)\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile Call of Duty might not be the same experience it once was I didn\\'t mind purchasing this title and playing it in the afternoons.\\n\\nAs I am older now I do appreciate the simplicity of just being able to join a match, running around shooting and killing people all while talking to my mates.\\n\\nI felt like I would have honestly left a positive review however to understand why I did not end up leaving a positive review you will have to continue to read on.\\n\\nThe main selling point for this game that attracted me the most was the two year cycle. I loved the idea of sticking with one Call of Duty for two years instead of barely being able to keep up with a new one each year. \\n\\nI feel like this idea of having a two year cycle would have brought more people into the series overtime as the game continues to be marketed, updated and talked about. I would image it would also would sit well with the franchises older audience as I would like to think that the majority of the older audience have a lot of responsibilities to maintain and not as much time to play.\\n\\nWell... as of today, or at least in the last 48 hours or so the franchise has decided that they have been making so much money off of this new title that they want to keep the fire going by cancelling the two year cycle and continuing by releasing \"even better Call of Duty\\'s\" and \"bringing the franchise to new heights\"\\n\\nSo here is my message to the franchise for this decision:\\n\\nFuck you.\\n\\nAnd to anyone who purchased this game at the advertised price expecting it to be on a two year cycle with loads on content coming out, I am sorry your expectations were ruined too.',\n",

       "  'review': \"9 studios, 3000 people working on the game and this is what we got... Best selling and most advanced COD ever made its debut as a technical disaster. People getting banned for no reason, couldn't able to play the game due to crashes and very bad, laggy servers. And after 2 months from the launch, most of the issues aren't fixed. Just like everything else in the game.\\n\\nBeen playing the game since launch on Battle.net and this game hasn't got any further. It's just another unfinished AAA game.\\n\\nSince this game contains Campaign (not included in this review), MP, DMZ and Warzone, this might be a long review. So here is the [b] TL;DR [/b]\\n[b] Pros: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Gunplay & sounds such as airstrike, guns etc.\\n    [*]Weapon tuning\\n    [*]Al Mazrah\\n    [*]New battle pass and backpack system\\n    [*]Proximity chat\\n    [*]3rd person modes\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] Cons: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]New 3D Audio which is worse than previous game. Leads to inconsistent audio and makes impossible to hear footsteps\\n    [*]Movement\\n    [*]UI\\n    [*]Lots of improvement from Warzone not included in this game such as option to remove or wear gas mask\\n    [*]Lots of bugs and issues, unfinished product\\n    [*]Animations takes too long if you don't have fast hands. Some gun reloads can be considered as inspecting\\n    [*]TTK (Time To Kill)\\n    [*]Much worse SBMM than previous game\\n    [*]Too many bots in DMZ and their god tier accuracy\\n    [*]Bad designed multiplayer maps\\n    [*]Big maps in multiplayer but not enough players to fill the map\\n    [*]Camper friendly designed maps and gameplay\\n    [*]Flashbangs and stuns. If you got flashbanged/stunned, just leave the kbm/controller\\n    [*]Not enough contracts in Warzone\\n    [*]Not able to create our own perk package\\n    [*]Disconnected from Steam\\n    [*]The price\\n    [*]Infinity Ward's realism obsession\\n[/list]\\n\\n[b] Some bugs/issues the game has/had: [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]Crashing a vehicle into a mountain sometimes causes server to crash\\n    [*]Respawning as mortar(a.k.a cluster) strike\\n    [*]When enemy used voice chat, people's names that appear on the left side might stay there until you close the game\\n    [*]Unregistered hits such as melee\\n    [*]Broken anti-cheat that bans people for no reason\\n    [*]Unable to move for the rest of the match when you deploy recon drone sometimes\\n    [*]Disappearing HUD after using airstrikes\\n    [*]Getting 10 kills in a match gets you shadowbanned\\n[/list]\\n\\nAnd the list goes on.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h1] Long Version [/h1]\\n\\n[h3] Multiplayer [/h3]\\n\\nKinda fun to play. Game's less buggy mode is either multiplayer nor campaign. But beware, you'll find yourself playing one of the worst designed maps in COD, maybe even in gaming history. And there is the Infinity Ward fetish; big maps but not enough players to fill the map. Vanguard was bad too but in my opinion, they did one thing right which was the matchmaking up to 20v20 in a single map. This game needs the same thing because most of the maps are HUGE.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h3] DMZ [/h3]\\n\\nThey called DMZ in beta state but they should've called it alpha or pre-alpha. Just a mode where you get in, do some contracts or some faction missions and get out. No economy etc. Nothing exists to keep it alive. Once you finished your faction missions and the 7 weapon cases, you're basically done with this mode.\\n\\nBots are way too much aggressive, it's not even fun. You get almost no armor if you don't purchase it from the buy and there are bots everywhere, shooting from far away, dealing tons of damage that will knock you out immediately. Beware, if you're skilled player or SBMM decided you're, bots will have higher accuracy. All thanks to SBMM.\\n\\nThere is also another map you can play which is called Building 21. The idea is really good in my opinion and it changes the whole atmosphere of the game. No mini-map, armored bots (annoying af), limited equipment and mini bosses. There are times where you'll see an enemy from away but you might not think that was the enemy if their skin is black/dark.\\n\\n[hr][/hr]\\n\\n[h3] Warzone [/h3]\\n\\nOh boy, Bugzone my beloved. I don't know where to start. First month in a nutshell: launch the game, crash, repeat.\\n\\nThis game is really [b] 2.0 [/b] because they abandoned everything what made Warzone unique/good and tried something different.\\n\\nTTK (Time to Kill) and movement what makes Warzone 2.0 not enjoyable. Can you kill fast? Yes. Can you get killed fast? Yes. Seems fair right? But if you're a rusher like me and someone is camping in the corner (which is the 80% of the community, sadly), most of the time you have zero chance to react. You need 3 plates to stay alive otherwise you'll die almost immediately. They need to adjust ttk a bit. I think long range ttk is kinda ok but close and medium, not at all. Akimbo's and Fennec will insta-delete you in close range. RPK, Kastov 762 and TAQ-V are so powerful in medium and long range. If there was a bit movement in this game, it might help you get out some situations, even with this ttk. \\n\\nYou thought Warzone had bad audio? Wait until you play Warzone 2.0. They managed to create a [b][i] new 3d audio [/i][/b] which is worse than the previous Warzone. You can play this game with no sound without a problem because you're not able to hear any footsteps.\\n\\nIW obsessed with realism but they forgot we are here to play COD, not something like Tarkov. Animations that takes forever to end etc. If I wanted to play something realistic, I wouldn't be here playing COD. But hey, lets take a look at their [b][i] realism [/i][/b] logic.\\n\\n[b] IW Realism Logic [/b]\\n[list]\\n    [*]9mm pistol can kill you with 3 shots while you're fully armored but 50 cal. sniper requires 2 headshots\\n    [*]Melee > Bullets\\n    [*]Jump out in a vehicle while driving so fast and get no damage\\n    [*]Heli dropped 1 meter above the ground explodes\\n    [*]Truck going faster than most of the cars\\n    [*]You can't armor up/reload the gun while running and not able to fire a single bullet while sliding but, you can run & jump while you're carrying 100 rounds lmg, 50 cal. sniper and 50 rounds smg at the same time\\n[/list]\\n\\nMuch more can be added to the list above. I think IW continue to provide/develop the engine and gunplay but for the love of god, stay the hell out of anything else about gameplay because your decisions made this game less enjoyable.\\n\\nThis game is pain but I don't know why I'm still playing it. Still, not recommended in its current state.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Full edit because my game finally stopped crashing 2 months post release.\\n\\nThe UI is still bad but my game functions, it\\'s still a little wonky to go between submenus to find barracks, calling cards (theres a submenu in a submenu now?); I really don\\'t care for big ass boxes that show me a picture what I\\'m choosing when it\\'s either on the gun or just a playlist.\\n\\nMTX are in, that sucks, they will try to milk you dry over cosmetics because core game updates it co-op, maps, etc are free. People are gonna support it, so buy it if you want it. One benefit about the battle pass is that if you buy in once and finish it you can buy into future ones; but, it\\'s still microtransactions, you pay real money for pixel skins.\\n\\nDMZ is okay solo but more fun with friends, its worth trying. Loot mechanic seemed kinda unnecessary until they put co-op raiding in which requires 30000$ on extract for a key; otherwise it was just a was to get the M13B from the funny guy in the gas mask.\\n\\nWarzone is Warzone lol.\\n\\nSpec Ops does get updated, and that\\'s good because it was ignored almost entirely in 2019 unless you REALLY wanted to get a wristwatch. There\\'s a blueprint tied to it I haven\\'t grinded for, but there\\'s a \"weekly\" star count; so they want you to try to do it. I haven\\'t gotten three people together for raids, but the idea seems alright. More co-op is always a good thing.\\n \\nCore MP is gonna be a clusterf-ck now that most people have tuning and you\\'ll get varying degrees of fun or bullied. Voice chat is still toxic (good) despite Activision\\'s attempted ban system. Weapons kill across the board fast, buffs and nerfs have been put in the game since day 1, most stuff feels in a better place than it was previous.Tier 1 (Hardcore) is in the game, but is more like a hybrid of hardcore and realism from previous games, so it may turn some people away. Shipment and Shoothouse 24/7 have been added to the game; meaning Invasion is no longer the \"de facto\" how to level your sh-t playlist besides kill confirmed. Cyber Attack has also been added in. Camo grind now functions properly and will take forever. Still feels kinda mid, I don\\'t know how to put my finger on it but it\\'s a good \\'turn the brain off\\' game, but it\\'s not something I\\'d consider amazing?\\n\\nCampaign is like four or five hours, its literally alright; having been a couple of months on there\\'s not a spectacular amount that\\'s memorable but what is memorable does kind of stick out. It\\'s a setpiece game, you have levels literally built as a \\'tutorial\\' for Warzone mechanics ie the highway where 9/10ths of the game is driving. You have the new Dark Water/CoD4 intro, which is pretty; the sniping and stealth water level with Gaz, et cetera. I still think Shadow Company is kinda wasted but it is what it is, there\\'s going to be a third game and they\\'ll probably milk this one for 6 seasons and throw a Treyarch in afterward.\\n\\nDo I actually recommend it? If you like CoD or if it\\'s on sale, yeah, now that the game stopped crashing every two rounds. But be aware the game has a very low TTK, and movement is faster than traditional CoDs, but it\\'s slower than most \\'modern\\' CoDs (2019~Vanguard). \\n\\nI like the game, but, I still think its like a 5~7/10, depending on how you look at it. MPs closer to a 4/5 and Campaign is like a 6~7 depending on how much you like it. It\\'s alright. I wouldn\\'t switch to a full recommend because it\\'s still a 70 dollar game and the pricetag is maybe worth 40~50? Most of my time is padded out by camo grinding and unless you genuinely like Call of Duty you can probably get sick of multiplayer in a week so. You do you.\\n\\ntl;dr\\n\\nits mid but its brain popcorn. it\\'s just brain popcorn that\\'s too expensive.\\n\\nI also can\\'t switch the thumb or it\\'s going to wipe ratings, and I\\'m not about to go back and delete 255 comments of tard fighting to match with all that being gone so. lol use your personal judgement.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After 600 hours of this game, playing multiplayer and DMZ, I cannot for the life of me recommend this game. Multiplayer is so tampered with on activisions part is unreal, leading to every match being all calculated either against or for you due to how matchmaking works. I didn't mind the skill based of the old games, but if activision decides you are doing too well, you are going to encounter the best players beyond your skill level, letting the next matches be essentially you dying over and over until your skill level drops and they match you against the most braindead players. You play game, you get punished, whether you are controller player or not. Don't get me wrong, pub stomps are boring, I like a equal match, what isn't a equal match is forcing me into the highest brackets of players because I do too positive and forcing me to have a bad time because their system is worse than most sbmm's I have ever seen in my entire life. This isn't even going on to touch on DMZ, on how their bots are either going to be the most blind, inaccurate computers you have ever seen, or each one is an exact clone copy of john wick, who is able to shoot you through the wall and glitch out very frequently, to which I'm not sure if thats even affected by anything or just IWs awful coding. DMZ is fun with friends, but a miserable experience when it decides that it will punish you for dare having fun, a vicious cycle of them rewarding you and taunting you back into the game and then beating the hell out of you so you're back to ground zero. \\nThis isn't even going on to how this game performs on most systems, which cannot be argued that it's pretty close to shit. It crashes for many people months after launch, bugs plague the menus, and by god the UI on the menu is horrendous, some of these issues which have retained since launch. I've been very generous with my patience, wishing that they would patch these, but I'm a fool for thinking someone like activison would worry about patching actual issues, rather than going for anything that results in benefiting the player more than Mr.John Activision would wish (I.E Exp glitches, Cosmetic glitches etc...). We all already know about the aim assist too, and the arguments that follow it so I won't even touch that demon, you want to know more, search it up yourself and I really insist you do.\\nI can say positively, that the guns feel good(the m13 and kastvov 545 suck though), and the variety is nice, until you realize 99% of attachments actually don't matter unless you're doing a funny niche build, which most have a punishment of killing your ADS in a game where ADS is the prime component of winning your duels, unless you have already pre-aimed. This game is so against the players, but at the same time keeps you in by giving you matches to you for free, drip feeding you to keep your retention in, rather than making a genuine fun game like the COD games used to be, just a simple shooter that can be played when you get home and not have to stress about the silly issues that plague new releases, and with a publisher and developer that ignore and probably hate their community. Even Halo Infinite, a game which has been plagued with issues since its release, their company listens to their users far better than this company (although that isn't a high bar anyways).\\nI went in with hope, and came out with cope, I cannot find long term enjoyment in this game, and maybe that's just me getting older, maybe FPS games are just not for me anymore, maybe this game taught me to go in the woods and be a monkey, whatever the end result, this game has sealed it for me that I will not be playing another CoD title after this, or at the most I will look upon the next ones with extreme scrutiny and criticism as I should have done before. I hope whoever reads this review can make a second opinion on this game, and whoever has already bought it I hope that you can find more enjoyment in this game than I have.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Only reason I play it is because I paid $70 for it....\\n\\nHere is what I have experienced so far:\\n\\n1. If you\\'re good at this game, Activision will make sure you are not. Whether the skill based damage is true or not, I have gotten 3 hitmarkers with a shotgun while the person using the same shotgun (with no attachments) one shots me. Also, no matter what gun you use, you will always be beaten by a pistol, especially a revolved. Get ready to stare at your monitor in disbelief or just burst a big \"HOW?\"\\n\\n2. If you bought the Battle Pass and earn tokens to unlock the tiers, congratulations, now you have the option of waiting until you quit the game and decide to play again to use them, or quit the game and restart it to use them. Every time you earn a token, it doesn\\'t register so you have to relaunch the game.\\n\\n3. If enemy team talks during the match (in-between rounds on S&D or after the match), you now get to see the mic icon with their name for the rest of your playing time! (until you quit the game and restart).\\n\\n4. Whoever designed the UI, my god... hideous. You remember back in BO1 when all ten of your classes were on the left side and you can pick it right away? Well now you have to scroll to get to the other half... SCROLL. This is very minor but still, how did older CODs have better UIs than this? Reminds me of that scene from the movie Ready Player One when they put up all the ads on the screen (look it up).\\n\\n5. The players are the same. No explanation, you know exactly what I mean. We all do. They don\\'t play any different here.\\n\\nOverall, $70 for this is not worth it at all. This game does have many small issues, but many small issues is not better than one big issue. You would\\'ve had more fun buying/playing Cyberpunk 2077 on launch day. If you\\'re considering buying this game, don\\'t do it now. I have fun maybe 30% of the time, but I can\\'t let $70 go to waste.\\n\\nEDIT: Steam told me I played an additional 11 hours and asked me to revise my review. Here\\'s my revision, still sucks\\n\\nEdit: allowing comments, but only if you\\'re a COD MWII hater just like me',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] You have all been mislead, this game is not targeted neither towards \"casuals\", nor \"the OGs\" of the COD community [/h1]\\n\\nBefore I get into the title and explain why you shouldn\\'t bother wasting time on MWII2022, or any AAA games of it\\'s kind, I\\'m going to list some specific things I like about this game and some that I don\\'t.\\n\\n[u] What I like [/u]\\nI) You can now select a variant of a weapon platform without taking up an attachment slot. In MW19, the AK74u became utterly obsolete after the Galil Ace was introduced to the game, since it had a nearly identical fire rate to the 74u, superior range, and you had an extra attachment slot that you wouldn\\'t on the AK, when converting it to 5.45.\\nII) Another nice QOL change is the choice to select whether you wanna have killstreaks or scorestreaks. On previous COD games that gave you this choice, you had to use a perk to convert killstreaks to scorestreaks, which typically wasn\\'t worth it since it didn\\'t make much of a difference, and it sometimes made it more difficult to get streaks (depending on the mode). Now, players can choose whichever of the two systems they want, which is how they should\\'ve done it a long time ago IMO. Players should be rewarded for playing the objective instead of camping at a choke point near the enemy\\'s spawn, not punished for it.\\n\\n[u] What I dislike [/u]\\nI) Pretty much all of the issues that were present in MW19, including the bugs, are present in MWII2022, 3 years later.\\n•Final killcams still glitch out, stopping abruptly, with all the players on the screen disappearing.\\n•Objects pop in 5 metres in front of you, breaking the \"immersion\" Infinity Ward keeps bragging about constantly.\\n•The riot shield invincibility bug has somehow returned for the third time in 4 years. It\\'s like the devs copy-paste the 1.0 version of the previous game, change the HUD a little bit and call it a \"brand new game\".\\n•Flashbangs are completely broken. You get blinded for almost 5 whole seconds, and the battle hardened perk only reduces that time, without reducing the effect.\\n•The visual kick of weapons is greatly exaggerated, even when compared to real life. I mean, if guns bobbed back and forth like that, the shooter\\'s shoulder would get dislocated after every shot, why did they make it like this? My guess is that they wanna give a false sense of \"realism\" to normies who think they\\'ve become gun experts by watching gun videos on youtube. The worst offender here is the M16, which bobs and sways all over the place when firing, making it more inaccurate than the M4, which is completely counter intuitive.\\n•Accurate attachment stats, which were introduced in Black Ops Cold War, and were still present in Vanguard, have been removed for whatever reason, which makes choosing between the dozens of attachments in each category a dice roll.\\nII) You might be thinking \"Woah, that\\'s a lot of bugs and single digit IQ design choices, surely they couldn\\'t have messed up worse this time?\". If that\\'s what\\'s on your mind, you\\'d be wrong, because oh boy, did they outdo themselves.\\n•The UI is some of the worse I\\'ve ever seen in any videogame ever. UI elements overlap with one another, a frequent example of that are the challenges on the lobby screen overlapping with the player list. Navigating the weapon progression menu is also very buggy and doesn\\'t work well with M&K. Infinity Ward thought it\\'d be a good idea to shove the message of the day when you boot up the game, and if you press escape, you get disconnected. So what\\'do you have to do to search for a game? Scroll the mouse wheel down. Huh? Did apes design the menus for the game? How did noone realize how confusing this is?\\n•There is this new \"ledge hang\" mechanic, that allows you to hang on ledges before climbing them. This is not a bad idea on paper, however, it cannot be disabled, causing it to frequently trigger accidentally, taking away your primary weapon, interrupting gunfights and getting you killed. It\\'s also a very buggy mechanic, if you try to climb up the ledge too quickly, your operator has some kind of seizure, after which he remains on the ledge, and you have to press space again, hurting the pace of the game further and increasing your likelihood of getting killed because of the game screwing with you.\\n•On paper, the addition of receivers, separately from the 5 attachment slots is a good idea, however, Activision doesn\\'t like good ideas. The issue with their implementation is that attachments are now shared between weapons in the same platform, and other platforms too, which is good on paper, however now players have to max [b] every weapon level for every gun to unlock all the attachments for a single gun. [/b] MW19, Cold War and Vanguard were already incredibly grindy, this is going to make matters even worse. Previously, if a casual with little time on their hands wanted to level up a few guns and use those exclusively, they could. Now, in order to unlock all the best attachments for a single gun you have to spend 100+ hours leveling up all the other guns. So how is Infinity Ward catering to casuals? This is what I keep seeing people complain about, but it\\'s not even remotely the case.\\n\\n[h1] So, going back to the title I chose, who is this game targeted towards? [/h1]\\n\\n[u] Is it targeted towards the \"OGs\"? [/u] \\nOf course not. The game has a hidden algorithm, which has been around since MW19, which forces you out of the lobby every time you finish a match, eliminating the social aspect of online gaming, to punish you for playing well in a particular match. The \"OGs\" despise this algorithm, and is one of the main reasons most of the COD pros and other veterans have abandoned the franchise alltogether. They also removed a lot of legacy game mechanics like the \"red dots\" on the minimap and the perk \"dead silence\", which discouraged camping, which is a playstyle the COD community notoriously dislikes.\\n\\n[u] So, is MWII2022 targeted towards \"casuals\"? [/u] \\nAgain, casual players just log on for a few hours after returning from work, turn their brain off, and call it a day. They don\\'t have the time to grind upwards of 1000 weapon levels, which take over 100 hours to complete. And now, with the new \"receiver\" system, they are forced to do so if they want to compete in the sweaty environment of SBMM lobbies.\\n\\n[u] So what is it? Who are they catering to? [/u]\\n[b] This is just my take, but to me, it\\'s quite obvious. They are catering to whales. A small minority of neglected children and adult toddlers with too much spare time and money on their hands, who\\'s entire life revolves around watching pixels on a screen change colors. This is the purpose of all these recent AAA business practices (grindy battle passes and challenges, \"cosmetic microtransactions\", hidden matchmaking algorithms etc.), to turn you into a loser who wastes their time helping the publisher brag about \"player retention\" to their investors, and their money buying grossly overpriced digital outfits and camos just to feel something new, because the gameplay itself is not enough to give you any kind of fulfillment. DO NOT GIVE IN, and if you have kids, don\\'t let them play modern online AAA games, because they are designed to get gullible people (which every child is) hooked and detached from reality. Don\\'t waste your life on games that take your time for granted. Do you want to achieve something noteworthy in your life, or do you want to throw it all away for some greedy billionaire? It\\'s your choice, but believe me, there isn\\'t time for both. [/b]\\n\\n Thank you for reading my review. I don\\'t do reviews often, but COD is a gaming franchise I grew up with, and to see it get butchered in the name of greed, while the developers try to redeem themselves with cheap gimmicks, is painful and infuriating. I hope one day we can go back to a simpler time when videogames were about unknowingly making pleasant memories. Until then, we only have indie developers to count on.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1] Not worth it. At all. [/h1]\\n\\nEver since those infamous patents were leaked from CoD:WW2 this whole franchise is nothing but a joke at this point. You\\'re simply not allowed to have fun. Not a single chance. You perform good in one match, the game is gonna punish you for the following 4-5 matches.\\n\\nSkill Based Match Making is the reason this game is suffering in multiple levels. If SBMM was really working the way it was supposed to, then explain me why, 90% of the matches I\\'m playing, my team is full of room-temperature IQ players, and the entirerty of the enemies are players that play like on my level. Why is this happening literally 9/10 matches? Every single time it\\'s the same scenario since the game got released. \\n\\nAlso, if there is a \"ranked\" playlist called Call of Duty League, why is SBMM present in public matchmaking on random lobbies at all times? Isn\\'t the game supposed to find people that have the closest ping like yours so the game can be a smoother experience? Why is it prioritizing K/D and W/L ratio for matchmaking, instead of ping?\\n\\nExtra note for SBMM, why are my weapons suddently behaving differently from lobby to lobby? M4A1 needs 4 bullets (deals 28 damage) but sometimes I\\'m getting 4 hitmarkers and I need a fifth bullet? While in close quarters? What is this Infinity Ward?\\n\\nFor some reason, on this CoD, you cannot disable crossplay. Yes you read that right. You cannot opt out of playing with console players. Now why would you do that you ask? I don\\'t know, maybe because on this CoD, the aim assist controller players have is ABSOLUTELY, and I can\\'t emphasize it enough, way too strong. Like I can\\'t bother calling it aim assist anymore, it\\'s Aimbot. For real it\\'s aimbot. You\\'ll see them having the worst type of movement, and the moment you\\'re slightly next to their crosshair, you\\'re done. They don\\'t even have to ADS, it works even when Hip-Firing. You simply cannot escape it. Press F to respawn, because the way they lock-on into you, with 100% accuracy, there\\'s no way you can win the gunfight, sometimes even if you shoot first.\\n\\nI get it, controller needs something to help players with the fact that they\\'re using just their thumbs to aim, but I don\\'t want to be a part of this. I don\\'t want to die from someone who can literally play the game with his eyes closed and he\\'ll be able to get kills. It\\'s simply way too strong, and there are plenty of videos exposing this. What I find the most irritating is, why could we turn off crossplay on previous CoDs and now it\\'s not possible? Isn\\'t the game having the most PC players ever on the franchise because of the Steam & Battle.net combo?\\n\\nSome TL:DR for you:\\n[b]Pros:[/b]\\n- Good Gunplay\\n- Good Animations\\n- Weapon Family Trees for leveling up your weapons\\n- Many Weapon Camos & Attachments to unlock\\n- AMD\\'s FSR works pretty well\\n\\n[b]Cons:[/b]\\n- SBMM\\n- No Crossplay opt-out choice\\n- Inconsistent footsteps & audio\\n- No Stopping Power as a perk\\n- No Ninja/ Dead Silence as a perk\\n- Matches feel rigged\\n\\nEdited for spelling errors.',\n",

       "  'review': 'To start off apparently I am one of the lucky ones who have only had the occasional crash but after a weekend of extensive play and early access to the campaign I feel like I can write about this game. Now if you like MW2019 or onwards you\\'ll probably like this game. But if you are a fan of the \"golden age\" of cod its time to stop buying these new CoD games, it will never be like how it used to be no matter how they market their games. Take off the nostalgia goggles and skip this one, they are pandering to us (the old guard of CoD haha) and will continue to push this disgusting micro-transaction/live service model of modern gaming. You probably don\\'t need me to tell you it ain\\'t like it used to be.\\n\\nCampaign was fine, some interesting gameplay moments and story beats but nothing too crazy.\\nMultiplayer has some great modes and gunplay is pretty fun but TTK is fast, possibly fastest we have seen.\\nGraphics are great! Feels like it runs better than previous new CoDs.\\nRegardless its more of the same safe new CoD that you probably either already love or hate. If I could give this a score out of 10 I would probably say 7/10 but it would score higher if there weren\\'t so many terrible bugs plaguing my fellow gamers, but loses points for predatory marketing practices. \\nWhy did this game cost 10 bucks more than previous CoDs?\\nOn the chance that you are new to CoD and have not purchased one before, don\\'t start here, and avoid giving this company your money.\\n\\nProbably gonna keep playing but that\\'s only really because of Halo Infinite and Battlefield 2042 flopping hard, yay modern AAA gaming.',\n",

Add the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter into a mixing bowl and stir until well combined.\\n-Transfer the crumb mixture into a 9-in / 23 cm deep-dish pie pan. Press the crumbs tightly into the bottom and up the sides of the pie dish. Set aside.\\n-Mix filling. Pour the sweetened condensed milk into a large mixing bowl and add the egg yolks and lemon zest. Whisk to combine. Add the lemon juice and whisk vigorously until well combined and you no longer see any juice. The lemon juice will thicken the condensed milk.\\n-Bake. Pour the lemon filling into the prepared pie crust. Bake 25 to 30 minutes. The lemon pie is done when the edges are set and only slightly jiggly in the centre.\\n-Cool & refrigerate. Remove the pie from the oven and let cool on a wire rack. Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate until firm for at least 3 hours before serving.\\n-Garnish. Decorate the pie as desired. I dressed up my pie with puffs of whipped cream, lemon slices, a sprinkle of lemon zest, and sliced almonds.\\n-Serve. Slice the pie into 10 to 12 pieces and serve cold. Enjoy!\",\n",

       "  'review': 'this is a reveiw literally the second day after the games full release, ill be sure to change it as they improve and update the game.\\n\\n(THERE WILL BE SPOILERS FOR THE CAMPAIGN)\\n\\nfirst, the game currently is a 3/5\\nthe campaign is fantastic, lots of variety and levels that really suck you in as you pull covert operations or go guns blazing in crazy gunfights. a bit disappointing that Farah is mentioned for one level, Hadir or Alex are never mentioned or seen, questions and concerns from the first game arent really addressed in this game. but overall it was a wonderful experience.\\n\\n\\nthe multiplayer\\n\\nas of posting this 10/29/2022\\n\\nthe multi is good, most of the maps on release are actually not bad at all, i really like the racewway and border checkpoint maps. the guns feel good, look good, even pistols got a bit of love in terms of firepower and range which is nice. all of the base ops are unlockable via challenges and theres a great amount of them, providing players some personal customization which is great if some really dont want to spend the money of characters when theyre all just cosmetic.\\ni also really really like how camos are done know, with each gun having four camos which, when unlocked through a much simpler camo challenge, are unlocked for all guns. no longer having to grind every gun out for the same camos over and over and over doing mundane repetitive and sometimes frustrating challenges just to reach the mastery camos.\\n\\none of the biggest problems however is currently the game is having a bit of a glitchy release.\\n1. the game is very prone to crashing, i think if youre graphics settings cant meet a requirement sometimes the game just kills itself and i have to sit for up to 10 minutes just waiting for steam to verify the game files for the umpteenth time.\\n2. Camos are glitching out, i spent all day grinding out the camo challenges excitedly to get the gold camo for the m4, just to see that i am unable to select any of the mastery camos to see if ive unlocked the gold camo challenge\\n3. the voice channels is a VERY GOOD idea, it allows friends playing through crossplay to talk and play together in  game so that all parties can still hear the game since things like discord and skype or pc and phone only, problems is its broken, there were so many times where we kept getting muted after loading into match no matter how we set our vc preference, we couldnt hear one person but he could hear us, and i was hoping that the vc would be prioritized whether you were loading in, or in a match while your friend wasnt. he has a ps4 so takes a bit longer to load in, but i cant hear or talk to him until hes loading into the match.\\n4. there is a SEVERE lack of content. im unsure if maybe IW is waiting until season one before releasing a bunch of content but we are missing quite a bit compared to the beta. executions that were seen from most operators in the beta have been removed so that everyone all has the same one, i unlocked the beta skin for horangi, but am unable to access his base skin so far it seems only the milsim ops have customizable skins. there was alot of hype and speculation that a few popular guns such as the honey badger was going to be added to the game, but its not there, think it was even usable in the campaign but i may have been confused. but its likely they removed it from the start of the game to use it as a season 1 weapon. \\n\\nso far the game is good, but not great, its prone to bugs and glitches and breaks and needs a bit more post release polish, which i think we all hope to see within the coming weeks, and hopefully not having to wait for fixes until Nov 16th. \\n\\nsorry for the awful review this is my first time writing a legitimate one and i had pretty much know clue how to convey everything clear and concise. tell me im stupid if it helps',\n",

This game is gorgeous, the atmosphere, weapons, animations, and characters are on another level\\n2. The gunplay is fantastic. Everything feels very real, and the guns are fun to use\\n3. The campaign is a lot of fun with some great missions and overall better character development than the original MW2.\\n4. The multiplayer, WHEN BALANCED, is a lot of fun to play\\nHOWEVER, there are a lot of issues with this game.\\n1. Breaking up lobbies to readjust for SBMM not only penalizes the player for playing well, it also doesn't give a chance for people to build rivalries or community with other players like in older CODs.\\n2. The aim assist on the controller is mind numbing. The fact that I switched to a controller and am overall playing better is a bad sign.\\n3. The main menu/UI in this game has to be the worst I have ever seen.\\n4. Weapon balancing is desperately needed.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend because the problems with the game can be solved and I see at least a couple of them being resolved in the next few patches. But jfc, it needs work.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m going to split my review of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II into a single-player and multiplayer section. I\\'ll start with the campaign:\\n\\nThe campaign was an enjoyable filler experience (emphasis on filler) for me and nothing more than that - I felt like at times the campaign went from awesome to cringe, awesome to cringe, over and over again. Some of the missions were super cool (e.g: \"Recon By Fire\"), whilst others were quite cringe (e.g \"Violence And Timing\", this mission especially felt like something taken out of a Bollywood film - felt quite unnatural and out of place to be honest). This year there was clearly a heavy emphasis on stealth like missions, which personally fell in good taste, but some might dislike that. \"Alone\" on the hardest difficulty and doing the achievement that requires you to not fire a gun was one of the toughest challenges I have had in a long time. \\n\\nThe biggest selling point for me must be the sheer attention to detail in things like level design (the Amsterdam level is absolutely gorgeous), gun animations, etc, and my personal favourite, the sound design. The sound of the guns, impact of the grenades, flash-bangs, in this game is truly art. The guns and explosives genuinely feel powerful and effective - compared to other years where they might sound more \"toy\" like. TL;DR: Decent campaign at best, nothing mesmerising that will stick with you, forgettable but good filler experience. A good bonus to the multiplayer.\\n\\nIt is worth adding that the game ran beautifully on my 3070/i5-11400 PC and throughout a 7.5 hour campaign, I experienced around 3 crashes, which in my eyes is not that bad - given how games are these days \"just\" 3 crashes is considered polished. \\n\\nNow, for the part everyone really buys Call of Duty for... the multiplayer: \\n\\nAs far as level design goes, I am on the fence. Some of the maps are quite good like Al Bagra Fortress, Farm 18 and El Asilo, where others leave more to be desired. Visually speaking they are all gorgeous to look at, but some of them play horribly and I am not a fan personally, though this is of course subjective. Honestly, there is not much to say about the multiplayer aspect of the game as of right now - if you enjoyed Modern Warfare 2019 you will most likely enjoy this game too and get a good few hours of fun from this game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® II[/h1]\\n\\n[u]Single-Player Campaign:[/u]\\n\\nThe campaign is so freaking boring that it's crazy. Seriously guys all you had to do was redo the same amazing missions from the original MW2 and improve it a little bit. Why did you have to remove/change all the missions in the original and put boring stealth/craft missions here when the game is not suitable for those kinds of missions? I never thought that story is a strong part of the original MW2, but this is way below even in that regard. I can't believe how st*pid Activision is. \\n\\n[u][h1]BROKEN MEDAL[/h1][/u]\\n\\n[u]Multiplayer:[/u]\\n\\n I have played the early access and am currently playing the full-release multiplayer. So far so good. The only reason I am giving this a positive is thanks to the multiplayer part. I might edit the multiplayer section in the future.\\n\\nMy Curator Page: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/40523765-Bearsonal/\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Comments off because I know the community...\\n\\nEDIT: How come when I shoot someone it\\'s like I\\'ve opened up a box of \"Captain Dunce: OOPS! All hitmarkers\" and when they hit me with a lower caliber gun the same amount of fucking times it just erases my existence? \\n\\nI just cannot have fun on here. Even as a team anymore. With the SBMM and EOMM, I get punished immediately if I do slightly good in a match, by being thrown in matches with people that just shit on me the entire time. \\nPeople complain that movement is slow and terrible, but it\\'s not. If it was, then explain why sliding and shooting around corners, or jumping and shooting is the strategy. Movement is still super fast and fucking stupid just like before.\\nShields and knives are near impossible to counter. Their feet are covered, can\\'t flank because they will rush and kill you. Can\\'t throw because they will counter throw faster somehow or just rush and kill you. Thanks.\\nAll I want is to jump into matches and have fun. No, not just stomp everyone, that\\'s not fun. I want to have fun. I want varied lobbies, showing that people aren\\'t just bots. It doesn\\'t help that the aim assist actually tracks for you, with no limitations on distance or if there are particle effects in the way or not. If your aim starts to move on it\\'s own, you just aim and fire and you\\'re gonna get the kill. I position myself better and shoot first? Doesn\\'t matter. Enemy moves around, causing me to have to MANUALLY track them with my mouse and eyes, while controlling recoil with particle effects and camera shake. While they can just slightly tilt R stick down and fire. Flinch? Damn right that I do but when you have aim assist, the tracking pretty much counters it. There\\'s nothing fun about it. I am only playing it for fear of missing out, and since I already bought the damn thing. The campaign was fun but that alone isn\\'t worth what I paid.\\nI am not ok, and this game is making shit worse. It is infuriating, by design. I can\\'t even get good games anymore. What is the new \"good\" for me is if I am close to breaking even. Before I could maybe 1 in 10 rounds get one where I actually do good. Now it\\'s just getting wrecked at spawn, or instant snap turned from someone who heard me moving across the map and has UAV that works through Ghost. Or, I shoot someone first, hit them twice, and they snap and melt me with their braindead controller aim assist.',\n",

I am really tired of this garbage that comes out. I cant even play this game with my girlfriend. had she been in my lobbies she cant even play. Just an unfun experience really. not every game needs to be extremely tryhard. I miss being able to play the game with good players AND bad players. also there is way too many cheesy builds to run. already seeing at least 1 shield knife runner every other game. For $70 and only MP to play with a 5 hour campaign, this game is not worth that much.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ve been a fan of Dead Space since before the first title even came out.  I was instantly intrigued by the early trailers and even ended up in the top 10 finalists of the No Known Survivors contest and won a free copy of the game.  I\\'ve counted myself as one of Dead Space\\'s biggest fans ever since and replay the original and Dead Space 2 regularly.\\n\\nFast-forward to now and we have this absolutely stellar remake of the first game.  I have to admit I came into this cautiously optimistic because it would have been easy to miss the mark when remaking a game as legendary as the original Dead Space.  Not to mention the well-known fact that EA botched Dead Space 3 by meddling in its development (injecting microtransactions, coop, and story changes) and set absolutely absurd sales targets which lead to the ruination of Visceral Games.  Knowing that this franchise was still in EA\\'s hands and being developed by an entirely different team was concerning to say the least.  \\n\\nWell.. my concerns are history.  They knocked it out of the park!  Having finished the game at this point I can say that this game stands beside the Resident Evil 2 remake at the absolute pinnacle of video game remakes.  The main and side stories of the game were expanded upon without being drastically altered which serves only to improve them.  Isaac and Nicole\\'s relationship is much more interesting for example, and we get further backstory on characters (and even monsters) that were more of a mystery in the original.  Parts of the original that could get a bit tedious (like the ADS defense segment) were polished and made more enjoyable.  The upgrade tree for weapons is very similar and yet enhanced with new unique special upgrades that make things more interesting.  Additionally the two main companion characters (Hammond and Daniels) are much more interesting and likable in the remake.  I absolutely loved the addition of optional side quests which expand on the story.  This is a clever way to add more lore for those of us that are interested without forcing it on those who are not.  \\n\\nI have to say one of my favorite changes with this remake is the fact that instead of being a chapter-based setup locked behind the tram, this version of the Ishimura is completely open and you can take the tram anywhere and anytime you want.  With the new security clearance system this strongly encourages backtracking when you unlock access to new areas.  I was also very happy to see that the game clearly indicates the \"point of no return\" where you might want to wrap up any side quests before finishing the main story.\\n\\nAll in all, I was absolutely blown away by this remake and I am incredibly hopeful that they will continue with a Dead Space 2 remake of this caliber.  Here\\'s to hoping that Dead Space is finally back!',\n",

Dead Space never looked better, and feels just as eerie as the original for the most part.\\n\\n- Expanded content, with a side-quests system and more optional areas. Clearing everything will require much longer than in the original.\\n\\n- Overhauled / reworked gameplay mechanics with better alternate fire-modes, quality-of-life improvements and mechanics from other chapters, like free flight in Zero-G.\\n\\n- The technical issues of the original, related to running it on modern systems, are no longer present.\\n\\n- A carefully-done remake that respects the original vision, atmosphere and gameplay loop, without deforming it too much with modern implementations.\\n[/td]\\n[td]\\n- A few sections have been reworked in a way that makes them less engaging compared to the original.\\n\\n- What have they done to Isaac’s face? Look how they massacred my boy! And Nicole? Boy.\\n\\n- The game still spawns ammo only for the weapons you have equipped, and this causes balance problems in the long run (1000+ pulse rifle ammo in storage on Hard?

Barring a few questionable reworks, the vast majority of changes are positive; they refine an already-great game to an even shinier polish.[/td]\\n[/tr]\\n[/table]\\n\\n[quote]Follow our Curator page, [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41449676/]Summit Reviews[/url], to see more high-quality reviews regularly.[/quote]\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2928964219\\n\\n[h1]In-Depth[/h1]\\n[h3]Setting & Writing[/h3]\\nSeveral centuries into the future, humanity sailed to the stars thanks to new technology such as shockpoint, enabling FTL travel, and gravity manipulation that allows dismantling of entire planets chunk by chunk. This is performed by giant spaceships called ‘planet crackers’ - one such vessel is the USG Ishimura. Protagonist Isaac Clarke is tasked with solving onboard technical issues alongside his crewmates. That’s how the nightmare begins.\\n\\nThe storyline follows a plot of intrigue, government secrets and religious fanaticism aboard the Ishimura, where total mayhem has unfolded already, plunging the entire crew into hell-in-space. Compared to the original, the lore has been significantly expanded with many more logs to find, other than reworked dialogues with Isaac being a voiced character, and the side-characters interacting much more with him and each other. This abundance doesn’t detract from the horror atmosphere, if anything expands more upon it. The writing quality is solid, and while some characters are kind of one-sided, it’s overall good.\\n\\n[h3]Exploration & Secrets[/h3]\\nThe Ishimura is so large it has its own tram system linking its various districts, such as Medical, Engineering and so forth. Differently from the original, this time around you’ll be able to freely use the transport to return to any section you unlocked throughout the main story - a necessity, given the new side-quest system and optional backtracking unlockables. Each section is itself divided into numerous levels, corridors and rooms, all outlined on a handy map, while a GPS tracker will indicate where to go next.\\n\\nExploration is highly rewarding, as piles of breakable containers, closets with loot and hidden rewards are to be found by those investing extra time to look in every nook and cranny - a necessity to not run out of resources, on higher difficulties. Enemies partially respawn, a necessary change given this open-world approach, after all the ship IS infested to the brim. Many areas will be initially barred behind story events or Clearance Levels, a new mechanic that replaces Power Node Doors.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929999534\\n\\n[h3]Combat System & Bosses[/h3]\\nForget center mass: to down a Necromorph you’ll need to [i]cut off their limbs[/i] using a selection of tools and weapons you’ll progressively find around the Ishimura. Targeting enemy appendages will progressively degrade and mutilate them, consequently hindering their mobility and attack capabilities. Accuracy and quick-thinking in combat are rewarded, as is triggering environmental hazards or using the Stasis (time slow) and Telekinesis (object throwing) modules to save ammo or waste less. Foes are varied enough and come in upgraded variants after some time; they range from the simple melee grunt to hulking beasts or lethal agglomerates of smaller monsters crammed together. Most enemies will drop loot once killed, but usually the ammo expense to down one is more than what you’ll loot, unless you get smart and efficient about it.\\n\\nBosses consist of especially mean and huge Necromorphs that obstruct critical sections of the ship, or have unique abilities. All of them have evolving attack patterns and specific ways to be defeated: you’ll need to analyze their weakness and use up all the saved resources to get out of a boss fight. Exception made for the final one, which seems to have been decisively nerfed compared to the original, which is a shame.\\n\\n[h3]Character Progression & Upgrades[/h3]\\nShops scattered through the ship still function and will trade ammo, healing supplies and utility items for credits looted around; you can even sell excess loot and valuables, like circuits, for an extra buck. Engineering benches allow Isaac to upgrade his tools, making them better-suited for the harder fights ahead, improving damage and adding special effects for a price in Nodes, somewhat rare items found sparingly or bought for a high price. Your armor and modules may as well be improved, but for all of this you’ll have to find the right blueprints or upgrade components; differently from the original DS, this time around most upgrade paths will be locked until you find the right gizmo around the Ishimura - a good balance choice to prevent early “min-maxing”. \\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930293697\\n\\n[h3]Side Quests, Optional Modes & Minigames[/h3]\\nSide missions entail finding out more about the various endeavors of side-characters, dead or alive, aboard the Ishimura. They are interesting from a lore perspective, and also include solid rewards at the end, such as rooms full of loot or unique upgrades. Minigames include a shooting gallery spiced up with alien intrusions, and a Zero-G basketball course - both of them award great amounts of loot and components, other than achievements. The optional game modes feature NG+, the standard “keep everything and play again” affair, and Impossible mode, a masochist trial with only one save, permadeath and even more brutal enemies.',\n",

This remake adds extra side missions, stunning visual enhancements, and impressive sound design, providing a true current-gen experience while the core gameplay stays true to the original game. It's a mix of nostalgia and freshness that targets both OG fans and new players. The game provides a jaw-dropping cinematic experience that will keep you on the edge of your seat until it ends. It gave me goosebumps from time to time; it's a next-level immersion. The overall feel of the game is fantastic and it is very well polished at launch, which is very rare these days, so that's a plus. if you're looking forward to purchasing it ?

       "  'review': 'I\\'m amazed by how well they manage to pull this off. It\\'s like the RE1 remake of Dead Space.\\n\\nFirst of all, the game is close to flawless on release, a staggering difference compared to other recent releases. Some people have complained about missing mission objects but I haven\\'t experienced any of that and I tend to break games. There is some stutter when entering rooms. While i hope they can iron it out in time It\\'s nothing close to Stutter Ring or the Stutter Protocol. Shaders are precompiled so that shouldn\\'t be the issue this time around.\\n\\nAll gameplay changes are for the better IMO. You move more like DS2, making you feel more in control. This might remove some of the tension like removing tank controls in RE but I always felt DS1 was a bit sluggish. They have also mitigated that loss of tension with the new \"director\" that can throw encounters at you when you don\\'t expect it. The backtracking and sidemissions add a lot of enjoyment and the world feels a bit more \"alive\". It\\'s just the perfect incapsulation of what it set out to be, RE4 in space (no, you still can\\'t roundhouse kick the necromorphs. you\\'re pretty much an engineer in an old school diving suit).\\n\\nModels have obviously gotten a lot better and some people don\\'t like seeing the wrinkles on Nicole (who is probably the same age as Isaac, 40s) and she is actually pretty if you stop being childish for a moment. You\\'re entitled to your opinion but having a 40yo engineer and a 20yo, well educated and experienced, doctor doesn\\'t make any sense (the people running defence also show their colors saying \"not everyone can look like model\", but she could literally still be a model with her face but she might be a bit short for that vocation). The raytracing also does wonders to the characters faces so turn that on if you can.\\n\\nSome of the story changes are great and add to the atmosphere while others seem silly, they tried to add a bit more depth to a specific character and it fell flat for me. I did play the original and if you didn\\'t you might not feel the same way, the idea itself is somewhat clever.\\n\\nThe same can be said about some other changes you\\'ve probably heard about, they don\\'t necessarily feel natural especially the bathroom one. I just don\\'t see why they would have three figures instead of just the one with halfpants/halfskirt, or just a sign saying bathroom since there are no gendered bathrooms on the ship from what i understand. It feels contrived and unrealistic which might take away from immersion for some people.\\n\\nI\\'ve played through the game once, on NG+ now and still having a lot of fun with the mechanics. Cutting limbs off of necromorphs with an engineers tools somehow never gets old (unlike Nicole amirite huehue).\\n\\nAmazing utilization of Raytracing, my stock settings had it turned off and turning it on was like night and day. I haven\\'t seen many games where it\\'s this prominent.\\n\\nAtmosphere is great with a lot of background noise keeping you on edge, weapons are fun and somewhat diverse (I mostly use the plasma cutter, and the flame thrower for those small creepy crawlies though), upgrade system is enjoyable and pushes you to play ng+ in a good way, the addition of keycards and backtracking gives a lot to the hoarder in me and ofcourse Isaacs iconic suits are just *chefs kiss*.\\n\\nI recommend this with all my heart and will now go and buy the bonus stuff just to show the developers that i love what they\\'re doing and hope to see more in the future.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Dead Space(2008) was one of my all time favorite games I ever played back on my Xbox 360. To see it remade is amazing feeling, one that I certainly didn't expect. For myself-and I imagine for everyone who played the Original- It's like coming home after a long time away. More importantly, it lets new players and perhaps even old ones who missed out, enter the wonderfully crafted world of The USG Ishimura. In a sense, remaking a game after all this time for young and old alike to share in. Makes us whole.\\n\\n10/10\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Dead Space is a classic of the survival horror shooter style games set in a sci-fi universe. Not having played the original, so I will talk about the game itself and not the remake part.\\n\\nThe game will put you on board the USG Ishimura, a surface breaker ship that goes dark after arriving on a distant planet. When you arrive on board, you'll discover different monsters that you'll have to face to survive.\\n\\nWe feel a slight inspiration of resident evil in the gameplay but with many unique and innovative elements. There is an exploration side with a lot of loot to find allowing you to improve your armor and the different weapons you find during your adventure. You will also find different gagdets adding a real dimension to the gameplay. There are also puzzles, some of which will force you to face monsters while solving them which makes these passages terrifying, I hope you are not afraid of the dark...\\n\\nThe game is also very immersive, the audio design is really insane and makes you very paranoid. One of the best things about it is that all of the game's hud are directly embedded in the game, so there is no pause time when you are on your map or in your inventory, you see what your character sees.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I recommend this game to anyone looking for a unique survival horror, as mentioned above, the gameplay is quite rich and innovative, the atmosphere is insane. This game really stands out from its genre and is a must have for any fan of this category.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Awesome remake of the cult classic sci-fi horror game (Dead Space) from 2008. The graphics looks very good and detailed and the sound effects in this game is outstanding. Very creepy to explore the big space ship (USG Ishimura) as a disaster on board the ship has happened. You have several great weapons to handle and upgrade in this alien outbreak. Great monster design and it feels like the cult horror movie (The Thing) from 1982 or the remake of that same movie from 2011. Very disturbing feeling.\\n\\nI played the game on my dated (2016-2017) PC: (Asus, GTX 1070 -GPU, 6700k -CPU, 32GB -RAM, SSD install, Windows 10, ASUS 24\" 144hz monitor @ 1080p)\\n\\n** I played with LOW setting @ 1080p resolution getting 30-50 fps. The game requires a much newer machine to bump up the graphic goodies. \\n\\nGreat work by (EA Motive). This game is an instant buy. I envy you guys who never played (Dead Space) before. This is the version to get no mather the cost..\\n_________\\nScore: 9 of 10',\n",

Not only has the graphical fidelity been brought up to modern standards, but many weapons have been tweaked or refined to be much more useful in combating the Necromorph threat. The cherry on top of this layer-cake of gaming goodness is the return of Isaac Clarke's talented voice actor Gunner Wright, who has joined us on our return to the Ishimura to breathe new life into the story by giving a voice to our armor-plated favorite engineer.

       "  'review': 'This positive review makes me sad for my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/1544020/]Callisto Protocol[/url] review I wrote. On one hand, I really enjoyed revisiting the Dead Space universe with Isaac. It’s well polished (outside of some performance hiccups (which I am acknowledging but not condemning). Gun play is great as a reskinned [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/254700/]Resident Evil 4[/url] clone. On the other hand, I am praising a game that I absolutely sprinted through the first half- because I knew exactly what was going to happen and where it would happen, because of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/17470/]my love for the original game[/url]. \\n\\nThe conundrum becomes, we as consumers are praising a remake, and voting with our wallet, we would rather play a retelling of a story we already know, than to acknowledge the hard work it takes to create an entirely new IP, doing new and DIFFERENT things in the genre. I really hope developers are not discouraged for trying new things with survival horror. Remaking a [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/17470/]15 year old game[/url], with virtually the same look at and feel almost feels too soon. I’m sure people will be quick to point out the praise and success of the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/883710/]Resident Evil 2 Remake[/url], however, there was much more time in between both games (21 years) which allowed for the vast difference in technology and console generations, and the remake radically changed the gameplay into a more modern feel. Dead Space (2008) and this game are virtually identical with the story beats.\\n\\nI gave [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/1544020/] Callisto Protocol[/url]a negative review, primarily because of some of the gameplay decisions, BUT, I was much more interested and invested in exploring the story of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/1544020/] Callisto Protocol[/url]\\n, then any slight deviation or side mission in Dead Space. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dukefrukem/recommended/1544020/]The Callisto Protocol[/url] universe appeals to me a tad more, creatively. That being said, I loved Isaac Clark in the original trilogy, I was invested in where the story was going to go after the Awakening DLC, and I HOPE, EA uses this opportunity to use this game as a launching pad, to propel the story in a different direction. Pretend Dead Space 2 and 3 do not exist, and let’s see where you can take this character moving forward. But if you’ve played the first game, and recall the series of events even vaguely, you likely won’t be surprised by anything in the remake outside of some nice eye candy. (BTW, Callisto Protocol is a much better looking game for what it’s worth)\\n',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]Intro[/h1]\\nEven after completing the remake, I still think Dead Space (2008) doesn’t need a remake, as the technology and design of the original are so advanced and future-proof that it is more like a game from 2015. That being said, the remake is a welcome addition – it extends and enhances the original experience, and as a fan, I love seeing the long-waiting return of a dormant franchise.\\n\\n[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]\\nThe atmosphere building is a staple of the franchise, inspiring lots of later horror games. With the smart use of light, shadow, darkness, creepy environmental noise, unsettling background music, claustrophobic environments and jump scare, the OG excels at creating psychological horror – players are so stressed about their surroundings for anything that might come out. The remake not only recreates this essence of the original, with updated visuals and technology, it also makes it better thanks to higher fidelity. For example, due to technology limits, the OG doesn’t have great flicking light effects or completely dark areas, which the later DS2 shows their existence can take the horror atmosphere to another level. The remake makes up for them while looking very good (the OG looks brown like many games at that period).\\n\\nAn issue I have with DS3 and the latter part of DS2 is enemy encounter becomes so frequent that there is no chance of building up atmosphere. The unsettling feelings are gone because players are just busy shooting enemies nonstop, effectively making the game an action shooter. I am glad the dev realized it - or because the OG doesn’t have this problem so it wasn’t inherited by the remake. Anyway, the remake has a good encounter frequency – there is room to build up tension while players won’t feel bored for not having encounter for too long. \\n\\n[h1]Level Design[/h1]\\nFor returned players, I think the level design is an even more meaningful change than graphics. I am very happy to revisit familiar levels and iconic locations, as most (or all) levels were retained and rearranged (with new levels added) while undergoing a modern spin to add more playability, such as adding side quests, more zero gravity and vacuum areas and locked rooms can only visit in later process etc. My favorite is the new circuit breaker where players must turn one or another switch on/off, like kill the oxygen or the light. This “pick your poison” mechanic is very brilliant as players must live through the consequences they choose, adding a new layer of stress.\\n\\nThe OG level design is good but suffers from being too linear – levels are divided too distinctively by basically starting from getting off the train and ending in getting on it, making the game kind of predictable. In the remake, levels transit more seamlessly and there is no longer getting on the train and goodbye, as Ishimura is now an open map that players need to traverse back and forth for the story and exploration. \\n\\nI like the idea of exploration, but it is not done good enough. As the story progresses, players acquire different levels of clearance for locked rooms and locked boxes, and a big part of exploration comes from back-tracking to open them. However, because the map system follows the original, it is not good for displaying the multi-layer and more complex map of the remake (OG doesn’t even need to use map). The locator was supposed to be a good solution to this, but for whatever reason, you cannot customize waypoint to the locator. Players are forced to use the map making it a cumbersome experience to explore. \\n\\nOn top of that, the exploration is too dispensable for not being rewarding enough. The most valuable rewards are weapon parts, which unlock more weapon upgrades. But they are not get-and-use, you still need to spend nodes to upgrade, making them much less appealing, not to mention even without them weapons are pretty powerful already even at hard difficulty. The worst part is that side quests (except one) only tell more story background and give some consumables along the way, which come plenty anyway.\\n\\nFor the rest, it is a shame that the game doesn’t improve the control in zero gravity areas as it is still as clumsy and disoriented as before. In these areas, combat is kind of cumbersome as well, since they are often not bright enough but have enemies coming from any direction. \\n\\n[h1]Balance[/h1]\\nWeapon, enemy, inventory all went through rebalancing to overcome some drawbacks of the original. I beat the game at hard difficulty and noticed enemies are slower than OG so that there is enough time for me to rotate over weapons to perform tactics, opening up more possibility for strategy, like I managed to shoot out fire wall with flamethrower to keep enemies in place, cut the limbs off from tougher enemies with plasma cutter and finally blast the rest of them off with contact beam, all of which were done without stasis.\\n\\nEven at hard difficulty, the game is kind of easy, but enemies are definitely more spongy than my liking, which is done for not only strategy but also for balancing supply and weapon. In the old games, I always bring plasma cutter, line gun, pulse rifle because they are good for all circumstances. But in the remake, they receive less ammo drop than they consume (un-upgraded) at hard difficulty. An un-upgraded plasma cutter kills enemy in 8 to 12 shots while it only drops 6 shots for once, so in the first half of my game, my cutter and rifle often had no ammo. Also, if you keep four weapons in inventory, these three tend to get less or no chance of ammo drop. I think it is to balance out them being too powerful (force rifle feels nerfed in actual use), opening more chances for other weapons. I honestly like this change as otherwise I wouldn’t discover the flamethrower has the highest kill-to-ammo consumption ratio among all weapons.\\n\\nOne small problem with trajectory and collision is that sometimes grenades and explosives just go through enemies without hitting them, but it doesn’t affect that much.\\n\\n[h1]Story[/h1]\\nNot much was added to the already abundant space Lovecraftian world setting, and the story changes focus on new characters and some original characters having altered fate and stance, paving the way for sequels. One of the biggest issues I have with the original is the protagonist is a silent tool man, displaying no thoughts and emotion whatsoever and just doing what was asked. In the remake, he is given a proper backstory and character development so that the audience can finally sympathize with him and understand his motive and thoughts that were not clearly told before.\\n\\nIn the original, most storytelling is by conversations while you are busy exploring or even fighting, leading to a hard time focusing on the story. The remake gives proper conversation windows (you aren’t too busy with something else) while keeping it succinct so that the storytelling feels better.\\n\\nAs for the downsides, there are some cringy dialogues, and I don’t think the story goes as naturally as the original. “Make us whole again” is a very memorable line in the original and is presented in very powerful moments, but the remake sort of spams this line everywhere losing its charm and impact. The remake does have a better reunion scene between Isaac and Nicole, with the game suddenly changing from fast to slow and having smooth music amidst the tension, but I still think the original story was presented better and has better writing.\\n\\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\\nI like the OG slightly better in terms of story, and its level design does have its charms. Because the OG is not really outdated, I won’t call the remake a replacement of the original, but rather a new way to experience the classic with a better atmosphere, adjusted balance and modernized level design. It is excellent even with a few minor flaws. I hope EA keeps remaking Dead Space in this style, but surely DS3 will need a big overhaul.',\n",

The gameplay and atmosphere are both still great so if the devs fix those problems I will obviously change my review. Until then, it will remain negative.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"The USG Kellion receives a distress signal from the USG Ishimura, where Isaac Clarke’s girlfriend Nicole is stationed, is how your roughly 12-hour nightmare starts. You don your RIG and reload your plasma cutter as Captain Hammond calls everyone on deck on approach of the massive flagship. Floating in space, the planet cracker thrones over everything surrounding it, a dark grey shape that seems so vast on the outside and so crammed on the inside, truly a monster of steel and glass.\\n\\nInside its dark and filthy guts, almost the entire crew has either been killed or transformed into Necromorphs, twisted, reanimated bodies that want nothing more than to kill you in one of very many, very violent ways. As the infection took everyone by storm, they left behind half-interrupted lives, notes and half-completed jobs, the web of which you will explore through notes, videos and audio logs.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927376329\\n\\nThis entire aesthetic, heavily inspired from early entries into the Alien franchise and heavily reliant on a type of dim, sort of candle-light lighting eerily revealing metallic, industrial textures is so memorable that a well-done remake of Dead Space would not only introduce its engaging world to newcomers and younger generations, but would also reignite interest in the rich extended universe this franchise has to offer (two novels, a bunch of spin-off video games and sequels, a comic book miniseries, two feature animation films, two graphic novels paint a detailed mosaic of the origins of Unitology and the Markers).  \\n\\nWhat is a game made with love? It seems strange to use the term when referring to a video game featuring, but not limited to: body horror, dismemberment, jump scares galore and oceans of blood, but Motive’s remake of 2008’s Dead Space is, without a doubt, a game made with plenty of this ingredient. The devs have a fundamental understanding of everything that worked before and made little clever changes that elevate the already solid structure of an inspired video-game into an even richer experience. For example, power reroutes will have you decide whether you want to traverse a dangerous section without light or oxygen, and the linear tram-based navigation now permits you to revisit any unlocked section of the ship before a point of no return that takes place before the last chapter. The levels have extremely similar layouts to the original but are arranged in a very intuitive way that makes backtracking for sidequests and optional locker rooms very simple and straightforward.\\n\\nOpen spaces are much more interesting than in the original, in no small part because there’s no more zip-based navigation. Wide, crowded hangars now invite you to boost yourself around and loot everything, and there’s even a bossfight in Zero G that makes full use of the free range of movement while floating. Sidequests develop backstories for some of the secondary characters and monsters, and credential-dependant lockboxes can only be opened after the appropriate-level RIG is looted.\\n\\nThe graphics are absolutely spectacular, offering plenty of vistas and eye candy worthy of modern GPUs. The game really shows its strength in the dark, where subtle changes, fog and particles create a deeply unsettling atmosphere and where you can truly feel Isaac’s fear. It’s a pity, however, that the game doesn’t use modern ray-tracing capabilities to show Isaac’s reflection in mirrors, which could really enhance his growing insanity under the Marker’s influence. Speaking of Isaac, he’s no longer the Gordon Freemanesque mute in the original, having an entire personality and a much angrier attitude towards Unitologists. There are some other minor changes, gender flips and race swaps and more heroic and dramatic deaths, but the ensemble has the same players and follows the same patterns.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927375738\\n\\nDead Space’s sound design also deserves special mention, not only because of the unsettling score, layered noises and clean blending of themes, but especially because of the convincing way sound behaves in a vacuum and the spatial design that enables you to quickly assess all dangers.\\n\\n \\tWhile retaining the spirit, narrative beats and most mechanics of the original, 2023’s Dead Space manages to improve upon numerous aspects and provide a clean, streamlined and well-optimized thrill ride out of the box. Its iconic and immersive game design sports the same diegetic UI, and the weapons and mechanics are for the most part the same as they were fifteen years ago, with a few different alternate fires and improved Zero G navigation, similar to the one in Dead Space 2.\\n\\n\\tAs in any other game in this franchise, limb-chopping will be your bread and butter when it comes to dispatching the monstrous Necromorphs, with an updated system that allows peeling, where you weaken limbs but do not cut through them. I feel the remake is more demanding in terms of precision and angles, where accuracy will save you a ton of ammo and weapons are more evenly balanced. \\n\\n\\tYou spend credits to buy medpacks, ammo and suit upgrades (with the addition of weapon upgrades that unlock greyed out nodes in the bench tree), and one of the most satisfying progression feelings as your suit gradually becomes more elaborate and advanced. The Contact Beam and Force Gun were my two favourite weapons in terms of punchiness, but the numerous upgrades, special passives given by unlockable upgrade slots and a fistful of Nodes will turn any gun into a powerhouse. Stasis and Kinesis remain priceless in the array of gauntlet events, ambushes and bossfights you will have to traverse.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2927376148\\n\\n\\tYou can get most collectibles and upgrades within a single playthrough, but if you’re wondering about replayability features there’s the obligatory New Game+ (and the final suit can only be purchased on your second run) and if you’re feeling particularly ironman-y there’s Impossible mode, where you only get one save slot, a single life and the option to continue on Hard difficulty if you die. Beating the game on its hardest difficulty unlocks not only a special skin but also the Foam Finger thing from Dead Space 2. There’s even an alternate ending you can only see if you find all the Marker fragments hidden in New Game Plus runs, so there’s more than one reason to complete Dead Space more than once.\\n\\t\\n\\tWhether you’re a fan of the original or simply a survivor horror enthusiast who never got around to checking this franchise out, Dead Space (2023) can be worthy of your time, provided you aren't deterred by the expensive entry price.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"As of February 5, 2023, I cannot recommend buying this game on PC-- this is subject to change pending the devs fixing the widespread framerate drops/stuttering issues that seem to plague the title. \\n\\nIN GENERAL: The game is phenomenal across both my Steam Deck and my desktop. It's a straight upgrade over the original, taking everything good about the OG Dead Space and improving it. \\n\\nHOWEVER: whether it be related to the invasive Denuvo DRM that EA has deemed this title to be saddled with, or some texture streaming issue, this game has serious frame drop and traversal stutter problems. In certain segments, my desktop rig (a 3070/9600k build) drops from just over 80fps at 4K down to lower than 30 fps (as low as 10, as I've recorded). These low framerates will continue even into menus. This is a widely reported issue that has yet to be fixed, and does not occur on console versions of the game.\\n\\nThe drops have outright ruined entire setpieces, made combat frustratingly difficult, and come at unexpected times. You can be moving along at 120fps in a complex environment with plenty of particle effects and lighting details, only to have a low-detail room tank the game down to 20fps. The drops and stuttering also occur on the Steam Deck, but are less severe (it's less noticeable to go from 45fps down to 25 than it is from 120 to 30).\",\n",

       "  'review': 'TL;DR Some improvements in the gameplay department, make it feel like a \"modern game\" however, steps back in the atmosphere department which overall makes the original a better experience. \\n\\nNo this isn\\'t a negative review focusing on the optimization issues. No this isn\\'t a negative review on Denuvo, this is negative review of the remake. I\\'ve seen a lot of positive reviews praising how this game is a better experience in every way to the original, though I don\\'t concur with that statement. Of course graphically, it is better in every way, and there are some game play improvements. I\\'d like to add that in preparation for this remake, I\\'ve played the original just a week before release and thus I think the comparisons I make below are fair considering I have both games fresh in memory.\\n\\nOf the top of my head, I like the new node system (in which it locks you out of future node slots initially). Furthermore, finding weapons instead of buying them has better encouraged me to use other weapons besides just sticking with the plasma cutter. This in conjunction with the game giving more varied ammo, forces you to use more varied guns. Zero Gravity gameplay is also changed to DS2 mechanics, which is for the better. Another improvement that I can think of is the power management system, which in some sections makes you choose cutting out power or air, which add some variety. Furthermore, the removal of loading times making it one seamless experience, and lastly the AI director for spawning enemies. Regarding enemies themselves, in the original, enemies would essentially stagger everytime they were shot, in the remake, enemies dont stagger pretty much at all, which makes things much more intense as you have less time to before they come at you. Overall there are some minor improvements which can make the game play more enjoyable. \\n\\nWhile there are more improvements that I have not listed, those are the ones I can think of the top of my head, of which most are in the graphical and game play department. Where the most of the negative aspect of this review comes down to main reason why everyone loves dead space, the atmosphere. The remake is significantly reduced in this department. While there\\'s no denying you are stuck on a spaceship alone in the middle of nowhere, the remake is almost worse in every aspect and not that close to the original in regards to making a survival horror experience. What I\\'ll list below are very slight changes that may seem insignificant, but on aggregate, really take away from the atmosphere.\\nStory - For one, while the remake does include more background story, it kills the mystery of what is going on in the ishimura, the VERY FIRST data board you read mentions the untiology and paints them in a bad picture right away, and soon enough you learn about the marker. While this information was fed at about the same rate as the original, in the original, we we\\'re left wondering what the unitology was and where these aliens came from, etc, compared this to the remake which gives way too much info too early. \\nMusic - Another big change is the inclusion music in some sections where it doesn\\'t need to be. Of the top of my head, when flying in space in zero-g they\\'ve added some background music which slightly reminds you are just playing a game. The original had no music, and all you could hear was the muffled sounds of footsteps and isaac\\'s breathing/choking as he started to run out of air. I\\'ve also noticed this music addition in some sections without zero-g, where I think switching the music with more atmospheric diegetic sounds would fair better.\\nSound - Honestly, the sound is great in most parts, as they just took the one from the original, but some areas such as the head banging scene and the introduction scene to the baby necromorphs were much more visceral in the original, the original was more powerful sounding, while in the latter, the terror in the guys voice was much more present.\\nAnimation - Again, animation so far is overall better, or the same. Yet a minor detail is isaac\\'s movement, in the original, his movement and stance were visually much more careful and tense whereas remake is less. This extend to running as well, in zero-g, running looked more hefty and had more weight to it, which really drives home the idea that you are this one man against the elements of space in this bulky hard to maneuver piece of equipment.\\nOverall Direction? - I guess the main point i\\'m coming down here is that the game feels like its pandering more to you the player which once again detracts it from reaching that realistic atmosphere the original achieved so well. It feels like a present day dramatized piece of media, whereas the original feels like a more realistic representation of what would happen and while it still panders to the player, the remake does so more. I\\'m quickly reminded of the intro where you get this gore filled stabbing of your crew mate all the while being shoved onto the window, compared  the original where its just him being stabbed. Another example being  or the cinematic introduction of the necromoorph that transforms dead bodies instead of watching it helplessly. \\n\\n(Spoiler ahead regarding one scene)\\nOr how about when Doctor Mercy puts stasis on you, I loved the idea and thought it really added to the experience, however the stasis actually freezes you, which would contradict that our stasis merely slows down things. It also just so happens you are in stasis for the right amount of time Dr. Mercer can monologue and leave. Wouldn\\'t it have been great if perhaps they could make you move while in stasis, and mercer takes your gun and walks around so you cant do anything but slowly chase after him. \\n(Spoiler end) \\n\\nOverall, the modernization makes it feel less unique... less dead space? I\\'m not sure what to call it, but if you play both games, I\\'m almost certain the original Dead Space will feel much more like a unique game rather than the remake which feels like a modern title.\\n\\nPerhaps i\\'m too harsh on the game, given that I\\'m making a lot of nitpicks. Overtime, as I put more runs into the game, my perspective may change. Though the game is a well done re-imagining, and certainly, if this game were released today as a new IP, I would love it more. However, the original does exist and there\\'s a reason its one of the greatest games of all time, which is why I nitpick. My point of contention focuses on the survival horror experience, which does not stand on par to the original Dead Space.\\n\\nReview was updated to fix typos and flow* and added the Spoiler example',\n",

       "  'review': \"I see a lot of people online praising the Remake so much and some people even saying how it does everything better than the original. I think the remake is mediocre, especially for an AAA title.\\n\\nThe animations look wonky. Some people like me were complaining about it before the game got released. They didn't manage to fix them and suddenly everyone doesn't care that they look straight up ridiculous? The moving, the stomp, the punching animations, etc. I managed to avoid being grabbed by necros in my first playthrough so I watched some of the death animations on YouTube. The moment Isaac gets grabbed the camera suddenly changes. It's really bad, I have no idea how people can praise this so much. In the original when you had to to face the drag tentacle, you could move freely while it pops up before it finally grabs you by the ankle. In the remake, your character completely stops and waits to get grabbed. It feels a bit disrespectful as the original creator of the game said that it was a huge issue for them but they managed to nail it. The remake devs just avoided the problem entirely.\\n\\nVoice acting is better in the original than in the remake. I like the original characters way better too. I didn't like how they also changed some of the story and added unskippable cutscenes that take controls of your character so you're forced to sit and watch. The cutscenes also hinder replayability greatly. That part where Isaac's with Johnston or Hammond and before he can move he slowly stays still in one spot and removes his helmet from his head, making you walk slowly, unable to sprint or do anything until the dialogue finishes, only for Isaac to slowly put it back up 30 seconds later? Yeah, that too.\\n\\nThe game also has some performance issues reported by many people on good gaming rigs like constant stuttering and input delay. I have an RTX 3070. While I did manage to play on 140ish (it can go way lower on some parts) FPS at 1080P, I did experience constant stuttering as well as input delay on the weapons. I also crashed thanks to a forced patch while I was half way through playing on Impossible without saving once, so when I booted up I started from the very beginning without any weapons. I kept playing a day later, this timesaving from time to time. Managed to get an infinite loading screen 2 times randomly so I had to forcefully close the game and revert a bit.\\n\\nThe combat loop is better than the original and you can no longer stun lock necros with your weapons, however they screwed up the kinesis. They are times where I wanted to pick up objects right infront of me and the game for some reason would not let me. That includes the dead necromorhph's blades or stasis/explosive canisters. I would try to grab them, but I would get some other object instead way off where I aimed or I would get some necro body I killed earlier. Also the fact that no one can really run this game at really high fps like +200 or 300, making aiming a bit sloppy. I've played FPS games semi competitively and playing on lower fps I can really feel the difference in the mouse feel. I'm not sure how to explain it properly but I feel like people who've also play FPS especially on low sensitivity would understand. Though it's not really a thing that the devs can do much besides optimizing the game better as the graphics are good. Maybe soon we'll get an overpriced GPU that can run games like this on +200 fps on low. Who knows.\\n\\nIt's an alright game but the original does everything besides graphics way better. If you're gonna get it, I suggest you wait for a sale. Also don't get the DLC. The suits are straight up just reskins that do nothing. I only equipped them once to see them.\",\n",

No Origin/EA launchers, no MTX so far - just some \"Deluxe Edition\" skins. (Fine as long as there\\'s no nagging for purchases in-game.)\\n\\nOnly major concern right now is performance, as the game basically requires DLSS or FSR to get anything playable. I would have expected much higher FPS considering how small and segmented most areas are. Some minor bugs and QoL concerns. PC controls are well mapped by default and supports multiple binds. There are some menus (store, inventory) that require the use of the keyboard (Q, E, space, arrow keys) to navigate, even when the player is immobile and should be able to use the mouse instead. Ultrawide is supported at launch (finally!) Steam deck is supported, but performance is not what I would call \"playable\" (minute long stutters, can\\'t hold 40fps, muddy visuals).\\n\\nI would consider this the definitive edition for anyone who hasn\\'t played the original, and I\\'d consider it a worthwhile upgrade for those who have.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1]The Dead Space Remake is already an early GOTY contender.[/h1]\\nI have had no experience with the Dead Space franchise up until this remake. I’ve known it’s been critically acclaimed for years, but I never got the chance to play it. So when I heard the original was getting remade, I knew there wouldn’t be a better time to play it. I kept up with the dev blogs about this game and seeing how much passion they had for the original only got my hopes up even more. Does it hold up to that level of expectation? Absolutely yes.\\n\\nOne of the most critical factors of any horror game is immersion: When the game pulls you out of the experience, it isn’t scary. Dead Space goes above and beyond when it comes to this. Every single detail and mechanic is integrated naturally into the story and world. Finding hundreds of weapons on a mining ship would seem a little too convenient, which is why everything except the Pulse Rifle is a repurposed mining or engineering tool. The open space segments are filled with complete silence. Every problem you’re trying to fight in each chapter has a natural progression to it. Even factors like the HUD and level design take this idea of immersion to the extreme by making it all an organic part of the game’s story. Your health meter is part of your suit and your ammo count isn’t tucked away in the corner, it’s a literal part of your gun. You won’t even see a loading screen past booting up the game or dying, it’s all hidden away behind traditional elevators or tram rides. I cannot express how far Dead Space goes to pull you into its world. This game alone has raised my standards for calling games “immersive”.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930632859 \\nBut how does the game actually play? Not only does it play incredibly well, it’s got a clear shtick to its combat. Everyone else is probably aware of it, but you don’t aim for the head of a zombie in Dead Space. Cutting off a Necromorph’s limbs is what you’re gunning for. Shooting the arms and legs is not only more effective, but oftentimes essential to keep your ammo count high. This gimmick doesn’t stop there. A few enemies are entirely focused on making risk-versus-reward decisions based on where you hit them. Shooting the belly of a pregnant Necromorph does kill it faster, but then you’re stuck dealing with its tiny offspring. Shooting an exploder’s arm kills it instantly, but if you’re not far away from them, you’re going to get hit by that blast and probably die. Great enemy interactions aren’t the end of Dead Space’s great combat though. Every weapon is incredibly unique and serves a purpose in your arsenal. There’s your standard rifle and flamethrower, but some of my personal favorites were a gauntlet that fires out a sawblade, a gun that shoots out pure concussive force, and the overpowered plasma cutter. Each weapon also has an alternate firing mode, and while I didn’t use them too much, I’ve already seen other people come up with crazy shit from using them. Another one of my favorite weapons isn’t even held in your hands. The kinesis module lets you pick up and throw stuff around as weapons. Explosives, sharp objects, and even the limbs of Necromorphs can be chucked as deadly weapons. I found it not only fun, but very effective to use, especially against Brutes. Besides the shooting, there’s a major emphasis on exploring your environment for resources and some light puzzles. My one disappointment stems from the fact that I never felt resource-starved, which some will argue as a positive.\\n\\nThe game also looks amazing. The lighting in the mining sector of the ship is my favorite, just seeing the metal gleaming and reflecting the literal stars was gorgeous. Even the worst AAA games handle their lighting really well, so I always look forward to it, but this clearly stands out among that crowd. A lot of horror games don’t really care for lighting because they go out of their way to minimize the amount of light for the spook factor, so I adore it in Dead Space. And the amount of body horror coupled with the realistic visuals offers a playground for the fear that video games have rarely replicated. Looking at a generic slasher enemy is enough for someone’s nightmares alone and I love that. \\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930632610 \\nBut so far, all of what I just said could be applied to the original Dead Space, minus the better visuals. And even then the original already looked really good for the time. Again, while I have not played the initial version, I have done some research on what’s different. The remake makes several changes and I would argue that all of them are for the better. The most obvious and likely most controversial for some is that protagonist Isaac Clarke is now voiced like he was in the sequels, they even got Gunner Wright back for the role. Dialogue changes were done so well that the back and forth banter without Isaac would just feel awkward for me. Several story beats are changed outside of this factor though as well. I won’t spoil too much detail on what’s different for this part but I particularly liked how they killed off one character in the remake way more. In the original, they just get bopped by a tough enemy, but they get a proper sendoff this time. As for gameplay changes, the Ishimura is no longer a chapter-based system but a full-on world for you to explore. You can backtrack from anywhere back to the very start of the game up until a very obvious point of no return. Not only does this vastly help with picking up any missed collectibles and help further immerse you, but there are also now a few sidequests that offer you more items and flesh out the story a bit more. There are probably other changes that I’m not aware of, but the remake is worth playing even if you already dabbled in the first game.\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2930628154\\nGenuinely the worst thing I can say about Dead Space is that the story is just alright. The plot entirely focuses on “Alright this part of the ship is broken, we gotta fix it or we’ll die. Now we gotta deal with this monster and call for help.” There are some literary themes that get lightly touched upon but don’t get flushed out past the basic ideas. The monsters also have a huge potential to be an absolutely great interpretation of cosmic horror that isn’t fully explored in DS1. And what potential it had gets kinda squandered in the later games, from what I’ve heard about DS3 and what I’ve played of DS2. And while the characters feel real and I could absolutely believe that they existed, I just kinda didn’t care about anyone other than Isaac. The story isn’t bad by any means, don’t get me wrong. There are no glaring plot holes or awkward bits of dialogue which is a huge point in my book but it just didn’t pique my interest that much. \\n\\nDead Space 1 was a phenomenal game from what I’ve seen. And the remake lives up to that legacy and more. This game is a pinnacle for the survival horror genre and horror as a whole. Hell, John Carpenter, widely considered the “master of horror”, gave the game his approval too. As of the time I’m writing this, I’ve already started a second playthrough. This game is absolutely worth every penny and rekindled my hope for AAA games and remakes. A lot of remakes cut content and are sometimes worse than the original and I’m pleased to say this isn’t another example of that. I liked it so much I started DS2 immediately because I got it as a free pre-order bonus. [b]I feel incredibly comfortable giving Dead Space 2023 a perfect 10/10, it is the definitive way to play the game.[/b]',\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1]NOT TRASH.[/h1]\\n\\nIn [b]Dead Space[/b], you are Isaac Clarke, an engineer sent on a repair mission to USG Ishimura, a gigantic spaceship that also seems to have lost contact with the rest of their mission. But you quickly realise this will not be your regular run-of-the-mill task as you discover that the entire vessel seems deserted, bodies have risen with blades for arms, they’re spewing acid, want you dead, and oh, the church is also involved?\\n\\n[table]\\n[tr]\\n[th]🟩 Pros[/th]\\n[th]🟥 Cons[/th][/tr]\\n[td]\\nAmbience\\nIt will make you anxious\\nSatisfying encounters\\n[/td]\\n[td]Some mechanics did not age too well.[/td][/table]\\n\\n[h1] is Dead Space a good remake?[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Dead Space[/b] is a third-person shooter horror game with gloomy corners, little to no lights, and metallic hallways that could potentially hide a monster at every step. The atmosphere is frightening, and your only mean of survival is to dismember your enemies.\\n\\nWe can also start by praising the development team for what seems to be an impossible feat lately. A game was released and was functional and optimised adequately on Day 1. Throughout my gameplay (so far), I never encountered a single frame drop or a loading screen. The transition in action is seamless.\\n\\nGameplay-wise, the mechanics have been refreshed and are adding a whole new spin on Dead Space; the Telekinesis and Stasis are getting some significant improvement and proper tools in your arsenal; you are not confined to one way of playing the game, even though nothing will separate me from my plasma cutter. Each gun is enjoyable to handle and provides a unique way to use it, depending on the situation. The difficulty levels are significant in HARD and above and seem just enough for Normal. The completionists will have a solid task ahead to complete the game without dying once. Finally, maybe it was the force of habit, but it took me a minute to remember that there is no dodge button, loyal to the original gameplay and reminding you that it has been 15 years. Furthermore, replayability is essential nowadays; Dead Space offer the possibility to play in New Game +. \\n\\nThe ambience is superb. Dead Space truly shines in the inclusion of modern graphics in the game, the metallic hallways, every dark corner, flickering lights, and the anxiety of an incoming jump scare. Every little detail has been used to put you in the universe of Isaac and make you feel like part of his adventure. The sound design is crucial in the game as it alerts you of enemies you haven't seen yet (looking at you child-monsters-on-walls); the engine noises, the random screams, sobs, and voices are developing more anxiety than having to host my wife's family over for the holidays. The music also goes along the situation; you forget it's here, but it switches between light tension, full-blown heart attack and deafening silence, which makes your heart race. Finally, different collectables offer tidbits of information, lore and audio logs; all add just enough to the general theme without being a chore to find or essential to the game.\\n\\nThe story did not change from the original, except that you are now part of it. Isaac Clarke has lines which contribute a lot more to the immersion. This is probably the weakest part of this remake as it remained untouched primarily, without being a negative in itself due to it staying loyal to the original content. The addition of different dialogues, lines and other elements was welcome.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924637819\\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\nIt is now time to answer the original question: [b]yes[/b]. I think this remake performs better than its predecessor in many aspects.\\n\\nDead Space stayed faithful to the original game of 15 years ago; purists should not feel concerned. Dead Space kept the same gameplay ideas and mechanics from then and improved on them a little bit. What sets this remake apart from the rest is that a whole new generation of players that can't build up on nostalgia will be able to explore the franchise in a modern setting. The graphical facelift is superb, on par with modern technology, and all the added extra details contribute significantly to the general ambience and atmosphere of the game.\\n\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2924932920\\n\\n[h1] Let's connect [/h1]\\nIf you liked this review, you can check my curating page for other games you may like.\\n[quote]• [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33562948/]Curating Page[/url]\\n• [url=https://discord.gg/U5Katayh6v]You can also join the Discussion on the Trash Can Discord server [/url][/quote]\",\n",

I watched the reveal happen live and I screamed with joy. EA Motive have shown nothing but passion, dedication and love to this remake by respecting the original source material and upgrading it by adding new material on top of it. The developer streams, no MTX's, just buy once and enjoy the experience! The game looks stunning visually and runs absolutely beautifully on my 3080 at Ultra settings, everything maxed. Thank you EA and Motive for bringing this gem back, I'm looking forward to more Dead Space content from you in the future\\n\\nMake. Us. Whole\",\n",

I believe it would even be enough for some people to check out DS2 and even 3 after they finished playing the game.\\n\\nNO CUT CONTENT.

       "  'review': \"I'm a total noob when it comes to Souls-Games. Usually I play RPGs on easy mode to enjoy the story in peace.\\nObviously there is no proper easy mode in Elden Ring, but the game allows you to play it in your own pace.\\nI literally spent the first 12-14 hours just riding around on my horse which I named Dolly, picked up flowers & only killed some easy enemies. The more I played the more I got confident & noticed that I'm able to kill some small dungeon bosses, because the game allows you to level up without going for the big bosses. When I felt strong enough I went for my first story boss & it was fun, not too easy, not too difficult. \\n\\nLike that's the great part of Elden Ring: you don't have to be this awesome Souls-Veteran to be able to enjoy the game. \\nYou can just take your time with everything, explore the beautiful world from the get go & just enjoy the view & smaller bosses.\\nThe game doesn't push you to kill a certain difficult boss in order to get somewhere ingame. You're not forced to farm the same enemies for hours on end until you're strong enough to continue your journey. You can just keep exploring & will eventually level up in the mean time. & if you're not getting any further with a specific boss, then you can just leave it be for now & do hundreds of other things instead.\\n\\nI would also like to mention that the open world is done really good! You're able to explore every single corner & the game even rewards you for being curious. There are no useless areas in which you waste your time. You're always getting some kind of reward everywhere you go.\",\n",

Elden ring is as hard as you make it.Flaws are few and far between (a few npc quests were unfinished and guess what, its already been patched-looking at you coz!).

       "  'review': \"This being my first FromSoftware game, I was a bit nervous about the difficulty as I'm not usually a fan of hard content (or very good at it), but to my pleasant surprise, it wasn't as daunting as I'd thought it'd be, and it actually ended up becoming one of my favorite games.\\n\\n[h1][u]The World[/u][/h1]\\nI can't remember the last time I had this much fun just exploring and running around in a game's open world, and realizing the sheer scale of it all was both exciting and overwhelming. I spent something like 50 hours exploring Limgrave alone and getting familiar with the gameplay and controls.\\n\\nIf I had trouble with a boss or an area, I'd just go somewhere else on the map until I felt ready to take it on, and there's plenty of things to do before even beating the first story boss. \\n\\nCreature summons were also a huge help, and I was very happy with the options available. Trying out new weapons was fun, and even finding new ones for the lore bits was very compelling and made me want to collect them all.\\n\\n[h1][u]The Gameplay[/u][/h1]\\nMy first playthrough ended up being something like 300 hours long, though plenty of those hours were spent doing random things like climbing hard-to-reach places to enjoy the view or leaving fellow players a message!\\n\\nI also spent plenty of time stubbornly dying to enemies I wasn't quite yet ready to take on, and there were two specific bosses that I had a really hard time with, but finally beating them felt SO satisfying, and it was worth all the rage I'd felt when dying repeatedly to them.\\n\\n[h1][u]The Multiplayer[/u][/h1]\\nI asked for help from some friends at times, and there are a lot of funny moments to be had when playing with others. It's also not that difficult to find a random player to summon if you need help with a boss or dungeon. \\n\\nWhen you're in a boss arena, you can't be invaded, so if you're worried about that, you just have to limit summoning other players to when you're fighting bosses.\\n\\nThough honestly, the invading wasn't as scary as I'd expected, especially when you have the option of asking a hunter for help. I have some great memories from when me and my friend were invaded, times where we got absolutely decimated but also close calls that made us whoop or sigh in relief!\\n\\n[h1][u]Ending Thoughts[/u][/h1]\\nI loved the npc's, although some of the quests felt like they ended too suddenly :( Also, I don't care what anyone says, Fia's hugs are nice and warm.\\n\\nSeeing my character in cutscenes, however few, felt very satisfying. Especially as I can't help but dress up for that purpose alone lol.\\n\\nThe only bad experience I really had with the game was towards the end. I absolutely hated a certain zone ([spoiler]Farum Azula, cough[/spoiler]), and it was the only zone I ended up trying to rush through. Moving around the environment was annoying especially because of the enemies. It's also the only location where my game crashed multiple times. \\n\\nI have to say the location boss was awesome though, as was every main boss honestly. \\nThe optional boss in the area was also one of my favorite designs and one of my most memorable experiences in the game.\\n\\n\\n\\nOther than that, I had a few stutters here and there, but nothing too disrupting to my experience.\\n\\nEven if the game seems difficult, I think giving it a chance is really worth it. The game gives you a lot of options if you're struggling, and there are plenty of playstyles you can give a go. \\n\\nSuffice to say, I'm super excited to see what the future dlc will bring and I [b][u]highly recommend[/u][/b] the game! \\n\\n\\nAlso, sometimes you really just do need to git guud ([i]I never did git guud myself tho.. :/[/i])\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Medium performance issues (as of 2/28/22) but GOTY game. This game is amazing and absolutely dripping with content. FromSoft didn\\'t make Dark Souls 4. This game is Dark Souls 4, 5, and 6 all in one. Absolutely massive game and the open world part doesn\\'t feel like an attempt to pad the game like most games, here\\'s why:\\n- Picking up items in the open world doesn\\'t have a pickup animation. This might not seem like a lot but go play something like Dragon Age: Inquisition and you\\'ll know what I\\'m talking about.\\n- You can pick up items while on horseback (also no animation), Greatly speeds up looting while in the open world\\n- Summoning pools makes getting summoned for bosses is easier than ever. All you have to do is be in the same general overworld location as a pool and all location get a summon sign\\n- Sooooo many more bonfire locations. Can also fast travel from almost anywhere using the in-game map.\\n- packed with stuff to do. Very rarely are you walking/riding for long periods before running into a dungeon/boss/camp/npc/etc. Every single side location has something to discover, Plus you never know what you\\'re going to get and the feeling of discovery is unlike any other game out there.\\n\\nThere are a lot of improvements over previous installments as well. In no particular order, here are some of my standouts:\\n- POWERSTANCING IS BACK BABYYYYY. Was always my favorite thing from DS2.\\n- Slottable weapon arts. Taking the weapon art system from DS3 and making it even better. This system is also tied to the weapon affinity system which allows you to switch up the scaling of a weapon at any bonfire. No more committing to a specific element or stat.\\n- The open world makes the game more accessible. Hit a wall with one zone? Just go somewhere else and come back when stronger. Sekiro had this a little but this game it\\'s extremely pronounced.\\n- The statues of Marika make it so the runbacks for bosses is not nearly as grueling. These statues work as \"respawn only\" bonfires that you can choose to respawn back at and are usually just outside a boss fight room after a lengthy run. You can\\'t rest at them or adjust your build there, but they prevent the grueling runback and allow you to smash your face into a boss over and over with minimal downtime.\\n- Having a dedicated jump button but keep the power of jump attacks. Risky usually, but can also be used as a counter to low swinging attacks. This also adds into the next system of...\\n- Poise breaking enemies. Is done by heavy attacking, jump attacking and guard countering. Adds even more move types to the game and makes every weapon a totally different playstyle and adds to the replay value.\\n- What are guard counters? After successfully blocking and attack, you can follow it up with a special heavy attack that has high poise damage. Allows for more critical hits. You might think this makes it easier but it takes more skill than you\\'d think to time these ripostes and it always feels good.\\n\\nAs with any game, it\\'s not for everyone, but if you love souls games, you\\'d be doing yourself a disservice by missing this one. If you\\'ve never played a souls game, this is the best one to try. The most accessible by far. No crazy hard tutorial bosses, the new ashen summoning bell gives some great support in difficult areas, and the fact you can always leave harder fights and come back to them later makes it so you rarely run into situations where you know booting up the game means you\\'re gonna be brick walling until either the boss dies or you give up.',\n",

       "  'review': '[h1][u]TLDR:[/u][/h1]\\nElden Ring, while imperfect, is the best implementation of an open-world action RPG that I\\'ve ever played. It feels like the culmination of every iteration of FromSoft\\'s \\'Souls\\' games into one truly amazing experience filled with intrigue, struggle, and eventual triumph. \\n\\n[h1]GENRE:[/h1]\\nFantasy, third-person, open world, action RPG, \\'Souls\\' game\\n\\n[h1]GAMEPLAY:[/h1]\\nElden Ring is basically Dark Souls 4, or Dark Souls but now you can sneak, jump, and ride a steed around the open world areas. You start by creating a character and choosing a class to determine your starting gear and stats  (e.g. Astrologer to be a spellcasting sorcerer, or Samurai to be a katana-weilding DEX melee build). You progress through the game by traveling around the map and finding items/gear to upgrade your equipment setup and defeating enemies to gain \\'runes\" that you can spend to level up or buy items from shops. \\n\\n\\'Sites of grace\\' are the bonfire equivalents in Elden Ring, and most of the time they visually display a path of light that indicate the direction you need to head in to progress the main story through locations of major bosses. There are plenty of these grace sites littered everywhere in the open world and within dungeons so it is easy to fast travel to where you want to go immediately.\\n\\nElden Ring is an open world game and there are various minidungeons/secrets hidden away in every corner of the map. It is to your advantage to seek out these locations to find rare materials and unique weaponry that may or may not change your play style altogether. The open world feels like there is always something waiting for you to discover, such as powerful enemies that drop unique weapon arts (ashes of war) or an NPC standing around waiting to offer you a quest. With the introduction of a day/night cycle, there are even some bosses that only spawn at nighttime in specific locations waiting to ambush you, but offer unique drops as well.\\n\\n[h1]GRAPHICS/PERFORMANCE:[/h1]\\nElden Ring, at launch, was pretty shaky in terms of PC performance. I personally played this game to completion with below minimum specs (AMD FX 6300, RX 480) averaging 40-50 FPS at High settings. I encountered no game-breaking bugs/detrimental FPS hiccups in any playthrough, though the only issue I encountered was that enemies would sometimes become invisible on my screen whenever a large group of enemies were in an area, but they were still lock-on-able and would render again when I got closer/killed some of the group (this is probably just because my CPU is ancient). \\n\\nIn terms of graphics, Elden Ring doesn\\'t break new ground when it comes to overall presentation, but it is a very colorful game compared to previous Souls games. You can really tell when you enter a new region when all the colors transition from one palette to another and the sky/landscape dramatically changes as well. Dark areas are also pretty spooky as you can only see far enough from the light of your torch or lantern and enemies hide in the shadows very well. \\n \\n[h1]STORY:[/h1]\\nThe long story short is: the Elden Ring was shattered into fragments and various demigods took the pieces to gain the fragmented powers within them. You are a \\'Tarnished\\' which is basically a pseudo-undead human who is guided by grace to seek out the pieces of the Elden Ring, put them back together, and become Elden Lord in order to bring the world back to \"order\". (All of the details in between for NPC\\'s and items is basically found in NPC dialogue and item descriptions for you to piece together, or until a genius puts all of the information together in a YouTube lore video)\\n\\n[h1]STRENGTHS:[/h1]\\n•Combat feels the best it has ever been for \\'Souls\\' games. Sneak attacks, jump attacks, ashes of war, NPC summons, mounted combat, guard counters, power-stancing, and everything else feels very, very good.\\n\\n•Touching more on ashes of war, they basically allow you to add (and remove later) a unique skill to most non-unique weapons in the game. They also allow you to change the scaling of a weapon to a different one of your choice (if you also have the right whetstone) so you can make a weapon scale with INT or FTH even if it originally didn\\'t.\\n\\n•Boss encounters are exciting and challenging. If you feel underprepared, you can always to back to the open world and look for missed locations and items to better prepare yourself. (Also, feel free to use your ash summons whenever possible; it is a game mechanic after all)\\n\\n•You can build a character however you desire, whether it be dual-weilding greatswords, holy knight, melee-spell-casting wizard, or pure archery.\\n\\n•There are lots and lots of weapons to try, leading to more replayability as you try a new one in a future playthrough\\n\\n•The crafting system is interesting as you can create consumables and throwable items when out of combat. You can even create bow/crossbow ammo which is very neat.\\n\\n•Just when you think you\\'re near the end, the map expands further and there is even more to discover.\\n\\n•Compared to the other Dark Souls stories, Elden Ring\\'s story feels the most digestible at face value without feeling completely puzzled from the outset.\\n\\n[h1]WEAKNESSES:[/h1]\\n•PC performance isn\\'t stellar if you are bothered by occasional FPS spikes or the rare game crash on loading screens. \\n\\n•Not game-relevant, but the game doesn\\'t fully \"exit\" when you quit out until a while later.\\n\\n•Early game bosses reappear as \\'mini-bosses\\' or just wandering around later game areas leading to some feelings of reused content.\\n\\n•There is a massive spike in game difficulty from the mid-game to the late-game. It feels weirdly balanced when enemies all of a sudden go from doing 1/5 of your HP in damage to 1/2 of your HP in damage.\\n\\n•UI could use a feature to compare stats of shop items with currently equipped items\\n\\n•Online connectivity can be hit-or-miss. Sometimes when you are summoned to another world, you get a \"connection error\" and the game boots you back to single player. \\n\\n•Be wary of hackers when playing co-op/PVP. Previous exploits have occurred where upon death, you would return to single player but be instantly dying forever because the hacker put you in an endless death loop. That exploit was patched, but we all know how hackers don\\'t just give up.\\n\\n•(Not a negative for me, but maybe if you like PvP): You can only invade other players if they are participating in co-op. Basically, unless a host uses a specific item, invasions usually lead to 1v2 or 1v3 scenarios (note: AFAIK fight clubs are only affected in that # of summonable participants is limited). I don\\'t invade, but I\\'ve seen many people whining about this change when it makes sense why it is this way.\\n\\n•So many important names sound very similar to each other that it could be difficult to remember who is who (e.g. Godwyn vs Godfrey vs Godrick).\\n\\n•\\'Great Runes\\' are pretty underwhelming in terms of power. \\n\\n•Although I enjoy the game design of not having a dedicated questlog ingame, it is still to your benefit to just read an NPC\\'s quest guide off the wiki to keep yourself on track.\\n\\n[h1]NUMERIC SCORE (if you care):[/h1]\\n9.9/10; easy recommend\\n\\nElden Ring has set my bar for \\'open-world RPG\\' standards. The added gameplay features like jumping, horse-riding, sneaking, etc. make the game\\'s action much more interesting and fun than previous FromSoft games. The game kicks my ass at every step of the way, but the struggle and eventual triumph is worth all of it. Though it is not without fault, I love this game and can\\'t wait for future DLC. \\n\\n[quote] Checkbox reviews are lazy copy & paste bullsh*t. ASCII art reviews tell you nothing. \"Let\\'s be honest, I only wrote this review for awards\" is a waste of everyone\\'s time.

       "  'review': 'I bought this game out of spite because one of my best friends convinced me for the 5th time in a row that \"Soulslike is for me\" even though I could barely be bothered to play up to the first boss in previous entries.  He\\'s not wrong that the game seems perfect for me: a character customization heavy ARPG that actually makes the player work to [b]play better, not farm harder[/b], with mysterious lore, gritty aesthetic, and rogue-like punishment.  Yet time and time again, as much as I [b]want[/b] to be enamored by the game, I find myself too frustrated to justify spending time improving, and default to things that are more forgiving.  I am weak.\\n\\nBut when I walked out of the gates and saw The Lands In-Between for the first time my jaw hit the damn floor.  I immediately identified multiple places I wanted to explore, and I felt like there was nothing stopping me from doing it.  Of course, the first thing I investigated reassured me that many things could, in fact, stop me from doing it.\\n\\nThat\\'s actually what I realized I needed from other Soulslikes.  I don\\'t mind a linear path, but I don\\'t like feeling trapped in the same mistake.  When I\\'m playing Elden Ring, if I can\\'t figure something out, I don\\'t feel like my entire experience is blocked.  I can walk away and go check out something nearby, maybe find a spell or new armor that gets me through the fight that was stopping me.  I\\'m [i]always[/i] progressing, even if I walk away.  That option solved my biggest problem with getting into the genre.\\n\\nWhat KEPT me, was all the stuff I\\'d hoped to get out of the other games.  The characters are vague, but the details they share are just specific enough to cause a sense of wonder.  I actually feel like I\\'m a part of this huge world torn apart by a tremendous war.  I didn\\'t feel important at the start...but I slowly started to say \"Wait you think I\\'m not tough after I took down [[redacted]]?!\"  I actually felt like the world was reflecting my actions and I worked to earn my place as the difficulty rose, and it was fun doing it!\\n\\nI felt this way when I was a kid and played The Legend of Zelda for the first time.   The storytelling is enough to get you interested in doing things/going places, but doesn\\'t flood you with details.  Dungeons are fun to explore and you know you\\'ll get something out of them.  There are clear rules to getting to the end, but your path there is mostly up to you.  It\\'s wonderful!\\n\\nNow to be clear, there are some issues I have.  The UI is pretty unintuitive, the important things are difficult to recognize as such, but honestly they\\'re so small compared to the highs I really don\\'t care.\\n\\nIf you want your hand held, you\\'ll hate this.  If you want to feel like you\\'re discovering a new world that will constantly have you wondering if you can survive the next encounter and push a little further every day, this is for you.',\n",

       "  'review': \"My mother has always been a gamer. She played many various series throughout the decades, but her most recent interest was Elden Ring. I've personally never played any of the Souls games for my own reasons, nor did I have much interest, but my mom would tell me about her grand adventures exploring The Lands Between. She was always enthusiastic about it and I would listen, even if I had no idea about anything she was saying.\\n\\nOn April 7th, my mom had a stroke and I found her slumped in her chair. She was rushed to the hospital but, after five long days, she passed away. After the funeral and some time to grieve, I was going through her things and found Elden Ring on her computer. It dawned on me that she never finished this game she was so ecstatic about, so I decided I would complete it in her memory.\\n\\nElden Ring is a fantastic world of exploration and discovery. It allows the player to cheerfully change course as they discover the next distraction every few seconds. There's hardly any required order of activities to perform and you can serpentine across the world at your leisure.\\n\\nThe gameplay is challenging, but rewarding and exciting. Hitboxes are tight, animations are fluid, and everything controls well. Melee combat is weighty and the enemies react in a satisfying manner. Magic is powerful and varied in execution to keep things fresh. Just about everything is viable, so have fun with it. There's many small rewards to enhance your gameplay hidden around, so it pays to take your time and comb over areas you think you've completed.\\n\\nDueling against other players is also exciting. They're capable of everything you are, so you have to stay on your toes. Be ready to counter their actions and punish openings.\\n\\nDifficulty is high, but not impossible. I spent enough time wandering early on that the first real boss fight was no issue at all. You can also level up and grind stats, if you want/need. Some fights are obviously going to be harder than others, but you can learn most of them and overcome anything the boss throws at you if you relax and read their inputs.\\n\\nThe story is interesting, but obtuse. Not enough is explained well in-game, and I relied on some abridged lore videos to better understand what's going on. I'll refrain from spoiling anything here though.\\n\\nI played through the first half of the game on my own, offline. Then I decided to try online when a friend was continuously asking if he could join. Both are enjoyable experiences, but I would suggest offline/solo play if you're a slower and more thorough individual.\\n\\nI enjoyed the time I spent in Elden Ring alone, with friends, confused, triumphant, and even despaired. It's an exhilarating experience that invaded my dreams and had me theorycrafting builds during my work hours. I'll enjoy many more hours in the near future when DLC arrives.\\n\\nI hope my mother enjoyed watching me play and was satisfied with the story path and ending I chose. I will never forget the life she gave me and the struggles she faced along the way. There are so many things I never got to say, so many milestones in my life she will never get to see, and locations we never got to visit.\\n\\nTo anyone reading this, please do not take for granted the time you have with your loved ones. Life really can surprise anyone at any time, anywhere. Every day you wake up with breath in your lungs on this beautiful planet is a gift. Spend it together.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'So, I came into this game as a person who hates the Souls-genre. I\\'m not that good at combat in video games as I typically like games where you can just hack or slash your way through everything. So when Elden Ring was announced and talked about pre-release, I was like \"Nah, i wont like it.\". Fast-forward to when it released I was watching a few friends play it and it looked amazingly fun. So I was like... I gotta bite the bullet and try it.\\nLo and behold it was the best decision ever! Elden Ring while a souls-game has a feature to it that actually made it a lot more comfortable for me to play than any other souls game: It was open world without a defined path you have to take. Sure, the grace sites tell you WHERE you should go, but you can generally ignore them. Also sure, you have to beat certain things in order to \"win\" the game, but you can like ignore that for a really long time and just explore. I had so much fun exploring the game and just messing around with magic that it really didnt feel like a souls game until like mid-game. That\\'s when the bosses started to get really punishing for me. However, I only had to really call in my friend like three times? One of those times was just because it was like eleven at night and I was exhausted and just really wanted to get past the boss.\\nSo, honestly, without going further into it and allowing you to explore on your own, YES get Elden Ring, even if you typically hate Souls games. This game is literally the souls-genre redone in a way that almost anyone can get into it. One last thing to mention before i peace out, but I have REALLY bad ADHD to the point where it\\'s rare that a game actually keeps my attention. I was absolutely hooked from start to finish with this game.',\n",

       "  'review': \"After 98 hours I believe I have fully finished the game, completing all bosses and completing what I believe are all 6 endings to the game, although I'm convinced there's 7 and now confidently write my review on the game.\\n\\n[b]For the sake of not wasting much of your time with this review i will start with the bad[/b]\\n\\n- Weird FPS stuttering issue, I didn't really get this bad compared to most people seemingly but I did encounter it in a particularly foggy and snowy area of the game. Hopefully they can fix up these PC port issues quickly.\\n\\n- The worst PvP invasion system out of all their titles. The only way you can invade is if someone has summoned help already, that means the invader has to always 2 v 1 at a minimum but in fact most of the time they are actually 3 v 1ing as the person being invaded will summon in additional help. I personally think this invading system is absolute garbage awful design and it's especially tragic with how well the rest of the game is designed and it really cuts deep with the potential this title had in regards to PvP.\\n\\n- Bad summoning multiplayer system. I believe this game has a level scaling system if you play multiplayer with your friends and use a password so your high level character can help out a friend, however for absolutely no reason, this is not the universal multiplayer system and they did not extend this level scaling system to the random summons to help people or the random invading PvP. This means that I, with my level 165 character are destined to never be able to use multiplayer system to help out new players kill early game bosses even though they actually have a system in the game that I should be able to use in order to do this.\\n\\n- An issue that almost all open world games have towards the end of the game. Copy and Paste enemies and bosses where unfortunately due to the scale of the game that variety of bosses and enemies gets thin, and you get bosses that are 2 or 3 man of previous bosses. Also due to the nature of an open world if you explore and happen to successfully grind through a difficult or area you're underleveled for, this will ultimately mean you have thus overleveled another area. I had this problem myself where I explored and facesmashed through a couple of massive hidden zones and thus overleveled probably 2 main zones I had to progress through later. Having said that in the last 2 or so zones and especially the last hidden zone of the game I seemed to be at the correct level for them so it seemed to equalise regardless towards the end of the game. \\n\\n- I believe the game actually tricks new players into a more difficult experience. At the start of the game you are given a direction of where to go through arrows on the map pointing you where to go. The arrows in Limgrave, and in Liurnia point you towards a major boss / zone that is actually substantially more difficult than the other major boss and Points of Interest in the zone. I believe for the sake of new players they should somehow adjust the arrows. I highly recommend new players, especially to the series as a whole explore zones to their maximum before actually following the arrows which seems counter-intuituve design.\\n\\n[b]Now let's talk about the good parts[/b]\\n\\n- There are a couple of systems in place that make it the most accessible From Software title for new players. The main system is the Spirit Ashes system that is basically an offline summoning system that summons an upgradable NPC or group of NPCs to help you. This system alone makes the game exceptionally accessible for new players to the series as these NPCs are frankly and I believe intentionally busted, if a player ever gets bored and wants to progress a frustrating part of the game they can pop one of these and fly through it.\\n\\n- Another major plus to this game compared to previous titles is the sheer variety of builds, especially through the Ashes of War system that allows you transform any standard weapon to scale with any stat. This with the sheer variaty of weapons, armour etc. that are already in the game adds massive replay value to the game over time. Also the game has a built in easily accessible respec function. I'm already looking forward to trying new builds through new game+. The culmination of this variety in builds really solidifies Elden Ring as the Magnum Opus of the Souls combat system, which once again makes how bad the PvP is sting extra hard.\\n\\n- Open World, Storytelling and Characters. I really enjoyed the Open World myself and believe it was a great evolution to the series that just requires some kinks sorting that I've discussed previously. You can actually see landmarks on the map without having visited them yet. Caves, Towers, Churches and especially the Ruins are all clearly visible on the map before you have visited them although there are also some hidden ones for the people like me that also like exploring.\\n\\nOverall I found the world and zones themselves very varied and interesting going between zone to zone, so that's definitely a big plus of the Open World design. Whilst From Software isn't the pinnacle developer of graphics, From Software has always been phenomenal at environmental design and they carry on their form in Elden Ring.\\n\\n- I enjoy the Elden Ring story more than other Souls titles. I found it had a much stronger foundation that you could more easily understand and follow, it made you want to explore the world more and interact the NPCs regularly. Elden Ring didn't leave a lot of the story vague, throughout the game it solidified the lore into quite an easy to understand package and I believe this is a plus personally.\\n\\nIn my opinion Elden Ring has the most interesting NPCs and also Quests out of all the titles. I love the secrets in From Software games and fortunately Elden Ring has a good few of them that were a treat to discover with all the NPCs. The NPC quests were quite long, fleshed out, interesting to the story and if you explored the game fully weren't really terribly difficult to miss. They also contributed a lot to a few of the endings which I found really cool.\\n\\n[b]Middling things that can be positives and negatives[/b]\\n\\n- The ambient soundtrack for the zones is the best out of all the From Software games, however I found a lot of the actual boss music quite hit and miss. Overall it was good enough for me to buy the Soundtrack so there's that I guess.\\n\\n- They managed to make, in my humble opinion the worst 'poison swamp' area out of every souls game. Take that as you will. Hidetaka Miyazaki spared no expense in the creation of this area.\\n\\n[b]Closing Notes[/b]\\n\\nTo summarise this review, I strongly believe this to overall be the best From Software title for a singleplayer experience and possibly the worst for a multiplayer experience. New players and Veterans alike can have an absolute blast due to the systems they have implemented. The sheer freedom in this game is incredible from the build variety to how you explore and progress through the game which gives this game a ton of replay value compared to previous titles and also gives Elden Ring the strongest combat in a souls game so far. The story is interesting and in my opinion more concrete than previous From Software games which made it very fun to learn about as you played through the game, the NPC quests are the most interesting so far. The PvP invasions had the potential to be the best in all Souls games due to the aforementioned build variety but they messed that up, hopefully they will change it. The multiplayer with randoms is unfortunately hindered for absolutely no reason. Hopefully they fix the performance issues, luckily I didn't really have any except a little bit in one zone.\\n\\nNaturally this review is all my opinion, if you disagree that's cool. If you have performance issues that's unfortunate, hope they fix them.\\n\\nYour review is 4,745 characters too long. Please shorten it and try again. Bruh.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"It will seem unfair, almost rude and insulting to play, at first. Every step of the way Elden Ring challenges what you think you know about action games, and video games in general. You're plopped into a world with little to no map markers. Zero quest log. Dialogue is spoken once to you by npcs, better remember what they say! And the world is completely open. It takes modern open world concepts that have been overused and some how makes them feel fresh. The reward of continuing on despite your many failures, is what makes Elden Ring so unique and enjoyable to play. \\n\\nNobody in their right mind would release a game like this in 2022. But here we are. Elden Ring feels like it's from a different time period in gaming. Like it came straight out of the 1990's early 2k's but with the graphics and precision you would expect from a title in 2022. Without all the bloat and nonsense. Elden Ring doesn't waste your time when you play it. \\n\\nIt's just a masterpiece. It's like the game we have all been waiting for. If you have been playing games since you can remember and loved Ocarina of Time, the Elder Scrolls and multiplayer games like Halo. There is something you will love in this game. The multiplayer alone is an exceptionally unique and wacky experience that I highly recommend.\\n\\n10/10, wish I could replay it all over again for the first time.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'FromSoftware said, \"Hey, we\\'ve never done an open-world RPG, I guess we can take a whack at it.\" Then they delivered the best game of the genre in over a decade (perhaps ever). Everything I dislike about modern OWRPG games is gone from Miyazaki\\'s masterpiece. Other AAA games just keep copying the success of Skyrim, but having bigger and bigger maps with wide open level design, 1000 map markers telling you exactly where to go and what to do at all times, and combat systems that are generally pretty lackluster and simple.\\n\\nElden Ring shatters all of those contrivances with a fresh approach. The world of Elden Ring is admittedly massive, but unlike other games in recent memory, no corner of this map ever feels empty or boring. The level design is lightyears ahead of most open world games. Verticality, labyrinthine platforming, and environmental puzzles are back on the menu after being abandoned by the hundreds of Skyrim clones this past decade. The \"legacy dungeons\" as they are known here, are on par with the best of FromSoft\\'s Dark Souls series (which is famous in part due to its long track record for stellar level design).\\n\\nThe combat system and character customization are familiar for fans of FromSoft\\'s previous entries, but in the new context of the OW genre, it feels better than it ever has. The addition of jumping mechanics, simple but satisfying mounted combat and exploration, and a heavily customizable weapon skill system compliment the play style of a huge game like this. Weapon balance has been a bit shaky since the launch of ER, but recent patches have helped every playstyle feel satisfying and powerful without sacrificing the challenge.\\n\\nSpeaking of difficulty. This game is difficult. More difficult than people unfamiliar with the developer would expect from a game of this genre, but not quite as difficult as the more punishing examples from other \"Souls-like\" games. The game does not hold your hand or litter your map with dozens of quest markers and points of interest. If your map is marked, it\\'s because an NPC just told you that they would mark your map, or you\\'ve just discovered a new fast travel point. The game subtly guides you to the next major objectives through unobtrusive visual cues and context.\\n\\nAnother way the game accomplishes this task is by avoiding the shortcut most developers take to \"level the challenge\" to the player\\'s current level. Elden Ring allows you to go wherever you want to go, but if you enter an area that you are not \"supposed to\" yet, then you will be punished by 15 foot tall hyena beasts, giant demon crows, and plagued wolves that will bleed you out in seconds. You will either naturally gravitate back toward the areas appropriate to your level, or you will rise to the punishing difficulty and be appropriately rewarded for your determination. \\n\\nEvery area feels rewarding. Discovery is an element that is difficult to get right. Even in some of the best OW games ever made, the lazy answer to reward exploration is to create 200 collectible items hidden in obscure locations that award trophies or minor character progression. Elden Ring makes genuine exploration feel rewarding nearly every time. Somehow they have significant secrets hidden nearly everywhere. if you spend 5 or 10 minutes striking out into the unknown you are almost certain to find sexy loot, a secret dungeon, an interesting enemy or NPC, etc. (but none of it feels like \"Hooray, you found your 147th korok seed!\")\\n\\nA few points of criticism are the performance issues that have been present since the launch. Despite having graphics that feel more like they were released late last generation, there is some persistent stuttering even in the most powerful rigs, so a consistent 60 fps can be a bit elusive. While the art direction and style are phenomenal as always, the graphics themselves are a bit dated. This is most likely due in part to the long development of the game, and partly due to FromSoft insisting on using their same old engine instead the newer options. Some long time fans may find the gameplay systems to be a rehash of \"Soulsborne\", and have heard some fans say that they wanted more variation this time around. I personally do not agree with this take, as I\\'ve played every single FromSoft game since Demon\\'s Souls on opening day, and Elden Ring did not strike me as stale, but I do understand why some would see it this way.\\n\\nI see these drawbacks as very minor in the greater scheme of this game, and they do not take anything away from the spectacular execution on virtually every level of game design. Though I may be slightly biased in favor of FromSoft, If I am trying to have a modicum of objectivity I am comfortable saying that I think Elden Ring is one of the best open-world games of the last 15 years, in the same tier as the likes of Skyrim, Breath of the Wild, and The Witcher 3. However, my more subjective view is that this is likely my favorite game of all time.\\n\\nEither way, this game is an easy 10/10.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Elden Ring is a very good game that not only deserves game of the year but is easily a candidate for game of the decade. Good gameplay, fascinating story, tons to explore, beautiful world, interesting characters, fair monetization, tons of replay potential, little to no bugs... Pretty much anything a game can do right, Elden Ring does right. I believe this is a game that everyone should own.\\n\\nThat being said, I do have somewhat of a bone to pick with this game. That bone being how lonely and depressing it leaves me feeling while playing it. For clarity, I’ve played and finished all three Dark Souls games and understand that it’s pretty par for the course with Fromsoft games of this genre. Maybe I’m just tired of this trend in the series, or maybe it’s the current state of the world leaving me looking for a more upbeat form of escapism.\\n\\nRegardless I couldn’t bring myself to finish the game seventy hours in. After lengthy play sessions I found it impacted my mental health for days afterwards. It’s a depressing world; once great, now all but dead. Everyone in it is either dead or dying and of those remaining, only a handful aren’t actively trying to murder you. They’re sprinkled around the world serving as beacons of hope in a world where there is no hope, and there is no future. Try as you might, there is nothing you can do to help these people. \\n\\nTo add onto the lonely nature of the game is the depressing ambient music playing constantly in the background and the ravaged landscapes littered with war torn battlefields. The utterly decimated remains of cities, and fortresses once great, now inhabited only by lifeless husks, or mindless monsters. You’re late to the party; there’s no [i] war [/i] to fight. The war is already over. You’re not the hero sent to [i] save [/i] the world, you’re the janitor sent to clean up what remains of it in the hopes that a clean slate can birth a brighter future.\\n\\nI think something that could have helped alleviate this constant feeling of loneliness would have been to implement a city full of people. Something to show the player that there’s more than just five people on this planet, there’s actually something to fight for. Instead we’re left with a hopelessly nihilistic perspective of the world of Elden Ring. No doubt by design; yet, nonetheless soul-suckingly depressing.\\n\\nIronically this game serves as a beacon of hope in an industry full of unfinished, half-assed, rehashed, overly-monetized garbage. Godspeed Fromsoft, and long live Miyazaki. Praise the sun.\\n\\nEDIT: Also, give us [i] actual [/i] co-op please. Not only would this help alleviate the feeling of loneliness, but is a long desired feature for the souls-like series.\\n',\n",

       "  'review': \"I honestly believe all of the people who say that Elden Ring has unplayable fps and microstutters. \\n\\nI've been lucky to be in that Goldilocks zone where my hardware doesn't encounter any of that; any frame rate dips only occur when quickly moving through environments. Load times are about five seconds at the most when using fast travel on a i79750, RTX2060 and 16GB of RAM.\\n\\nThe game itself is a marvel. The addition of jumping, reintroduction of powerstances and weapon arts make it the darkest of all Dark Souls. \\n\\nJust refund it under Steam's <2 hour played policy if you're encountering performance issues, otherwise you're missing out on a really neat game :)\",\n",

I found TWO new areas after I had beaten the final boss)\\n\\n I have done nothing since 4pm on Thursday, February 24th but wake up, play this game, and go to sleep. If you are concerned about not liking open worlds but you like FromSoft games, just give Elden Ring a chance, I swear it will be worth it. Most open world games for the last decade are full of nothing. They look nice, but have next to zero substance. Elden Ring's open world is comparable to Breath of the Wild, and no game in since BotW's release has made me feel the way BotW did. Every way is the right way. There is insane new stuff around every corner. You'll think you have dementia because every 20 minutes you'll find some insane new thing and forget what you were actually trying to do beforehand. It's not a graphical marvel, but FromSoft has never had the chance to apply their style to a fully realized world, and the Lands Between are jaw dropping at times, and always stunning regardless of your location. While at its core its still SoulsBorne, it's hard to compare to the rest of the series because of how much of a difference the open world makes. Elden Ring was worth the wait, and is easily one of my favorite games of all time. This game is worth full price and always will be and you should support FromSoftware and buy this game at $60 if you can afford to do so. Hopefully they will be making memorable and creative games for the forseeable future.\\n\\nIf you are worried about the PC performance issues many people have complained about, here is my input on them. I have a 2070 super, 32GB of ram, and an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor 3.59 GHz. It only occasionally (every 15-30 minutes maybe) stutters when I'm in a large open area or when there are lots of particle effects on screen. It's not unplayable, it is a second or two of reduced framerate. It has never gotten me killed or made the difference between life or death in 60 hours. It is locked at 60fps, which is not a problem to me and it shouldn't be to you either. Like I said, FromSoft games have never been graphical innovators. The difference between 60 and 120 frames is negligible and FromSoft has made it clear they're working to optimize it as much as possible. There has been noticeable improvement from day 1 even. You could probably run this game just fine with a 1070 as the recommended specs suggest. It's not unplayable unless you're a complete snob, in which case I suggest you remove the graphics card from your rear end.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"[h1] The Lands Between me and the Elden Ring [/h1]\\n\\nThis is going to be a long one, go get a cup of coffee if you care enough about it. \\n\\nYou know that feeling of being completely hooked to a brand new thematic world? Elden Ring manages to do it just as you start your journey in The Lands Between. \\n\\nFight your journey through dungeons and catacombs, find treasures, get to know your enemies and discover brand new areas, each containing new lore and development that can be discovered by various meanings, talking to NPCs, reading items descriptions, finding patterns that links the bosses and lords of that area to the creatures there. It's everything we always wanted in a Classic Fantasy Medieval RPG. \\n\\nFor the first days If I could I would not have stopped playing this game by any means, I just wanted to discover more and more and unravel it's secrets, so much fun, especially when you have friends to talk about and when you realize, they are in a totally different area that you don't even got to explore yet, but the game gives you that freedom, you are allowed to do what you can in order to progress, by your own pace and your own way. \\n\\nThe combat got much better from previous titles in the soul series, being able to jump is amazing and having your horse to battle along side you creates a feeling that the other games simply couldn't give you. The hitboxes are better, the battles are fluid ( When you don't have that FPS drop from nowhere, but I'll get there ) and I truly believe that everyone can enjoy this game, you are the one who defines the actual difficulty of the game, there's a reason people can beat this game without getting hit, and even though of course, many bosses are tough especially if you want to play a certain way, you can and will GIT GUT, take your time. After you are done with that annoying boss the adrenaline rush you will have will be worth it. \\n\\nThe soundtrack and the world sounds are just amazing, you can hear the noises inside dungeons, the miners banging their pickaxes against the rocks, the screeches of the creatures, the mad-whispering of the anguished souls, the water flows, the birds chirping, everything feels natural and involving. Everything made so that the world feels alive and true to it's nature. \\n\\nAs far as the lore goes, it's a Souls game, it will be cryptic but this one gives you much more to know about, it hints you about it's mysteries and what's happening in a way that feels more natural and approachable. And all the endings and ways to get there will allow you to speculate in your own way if that happened because it had to be this way or you couldn't really do anything else about it, letting a lot for your own mind to imagine and distinguish. You'll have your own theories at the end of the game, wondering what could possibly follow your decisions. What will happen to that world after that lowly tarnished changed it. \\n\\n[h1]The Ring was a bit broken though...[/h1]\\n\\nWell,  not everything is as amazing as it could be, being very straightforward, some recycled bosses felt a bit underwhelming and the optimization could be much better. After the first patch things got better, and it's far from being unplayable, but the game still struggles in some areas, and that it's not dependent on hardware, rather, it's probably related to the way it was programmed. Hopefully the will keep following with the intended patches and keep improving that segment as much as they can.\\n\\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\\n\\nAll in all, it truly is an amazing game and I'm happy that it managed to keep up with our expectations, it's certainly a title that Ill keep coming back to play more in the future. It's hard nowadays for games that have an open world to not feel empty and to not make the player feel tired, they sure managed to do it in a much better way than other recent titles could, and that alone is something that I was sure looking forward to.\",\n",

FromSoft have managed to somehow create a huge (and I do mean huge) open world version of Dark Souls with lots of Bloodborne and Sekiro in the mix too that surpasses them all in pretty much every way. A game full of wonder, secrets and excitement all the way through. The art style and soundtrack are glorious and of course there's the challenge. It's tough at times but rarely does a game feel so satisfying overcoming those challenges. Great fun.\\nA fantastic gaming experience. I highly recommend Elden Ring.\\n\",\n",

       "  'review': \"Game is bloody brilliant. They took the classic Dark Souls format and made it more accessible in 3 ways.\\nFirst, there's more to do. More items, quests, and materials to collect means progression feels more meaningful. \\nSecond, the graphics are much prettier.\\nThird and most important, the game feels easier. It's not *actually* easier, but the open world structure means you don't get stuck bashing your head against a really hard boss fight. If an encounter is too hard, you just go around it and find something else to do while you get stronger. You probably won't even attempt the first boss until you've hit a major power spike. This means less time head bashing and more time making progress and improving your character. Feeling stuck was one of the chief complaints I had about the Dark Souls series, and it seems like From Software has fixed that.\\n\\nEdit: I was super butthurt by the stuttering too until I followed the steps in this thread and completely fixed it! https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/t0q22j/possible_fix_for_pc_frame_rate/\",\n",

       "      <td>[h1]A dream for every Potterhead and those who want to become one![/h1]\\n[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]\\n\\n\\nSometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....\\n\\nHogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.\\n\\nI don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of \"Harry Potter\" made me buy it in an instant.\\n\\nThe following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.\\n\\n[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won't be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613\\n\\n\\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\\nSo far so good. It starts off with a generic \"You are the chosen one!\" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nOverwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.\\n\\nFirst off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.\\n\\nThen you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.\\n\\nAlso: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.\\n\\nIf you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the \"Floo powder\" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  \\n\\nDecorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Combat:[/h1]\\n\\nWhat would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. \\n\\nFighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. \\n\\nFor your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.\\nThe further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.\\n\\nAs a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]\\n\\nThere is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.\\nI just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]\\n\\nJust wow!  \\nHogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]\\n\\nI play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]\\n\\nSimply magical!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8\\nI also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!\\n\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]You know you want it! For me it is already GOTY. Not a single game in the last months kept me so occupied. Now if you excuse me I have to collect more things for my potions and maybe get lost on my way in a random ruin hunting for treasure.[/u]</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I have finished my first playthrough of the game, have put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.\\n\\nPersonally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. \\n\\nThe story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.\\n\\nI have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.\\n\\nOutside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable.</td>\n",

       "0  [h1]A dream for every Potterhead and those who want to become one![/h1]\\n[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]\\n\\n\\nSometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....\\n\\nHogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.\\n\\nI don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of \"Harry Potter\" made me buy it in an instant.\\n\\nThe following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.\\n\\n[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won't be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613\\n\\n\\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\\nSo far so good. It starts off with a generic \"You are the chosen one!\" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nOverwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.\\n\\nFirst off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.\\n\\nThen you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.\\n\\nAlso: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.\\n\\nIf you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the \"Floo powder\" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  \\n\\nDecorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Combat:[/h1]\\n\\nWhat would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. \\n\\nFighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. \\n\\nFor your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.\\nThe further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.\\n\\nAs a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]\\n\\nThere is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.\\nI just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]\\n\\nJust wow!  \\nHogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]\\n\\nI play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]\\n\\nSimply magical!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8\\nI also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!\\n\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]You know you want it! For me it is already GOTY. Not a single game in the last months kept me so occupied. Now if you excuse me I have to collect more things for my potions and maybe get lost on my way in a random ruin hunting for treasure.[/u]   \n",

put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.\\n\\nPersonally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. \\n\\nThe story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.\\n\\nI have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.\\n\\nOutside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable.   \n",

       "      <td>[h1]A dream for every Potterhead and those who want to become one![/h1]\\n[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]\\n\\n\\nSometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....\\n\\nHogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.\\n\\nI don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of \"Harry Potter\" made me buy it in an instant.\\n\\nThe following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.\\n\\n[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won't be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613\\n\\n\\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\\nSo far so good. It starts off with a generic \"You are the chosen one!\" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nOverwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.\\n\\nFirst off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.\\n\\nThen you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.\\n\\nAlso: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.\\n\\nIf you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the \"Floo powder\" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  \\n\\nDecorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Combat:[/h1]\\n\\nWhat would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. \\n\\nFighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. \\n\\nFor your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.\\nThe further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.\\n\\nAs a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]\\n\\nThere is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.\\nI just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]\\n\\nJust wow!  \\nHogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]\\n\\nI play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]\\n\\nSimply magical!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8\\nI also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!\\n\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]You know you want it! For me it is already GOTY. Not a single game in the last months kept me so occupied. Now if you excuse me I have to collect more things for my potions and maybe get lost on my way in a random ruin hunting for treasure.[/u]</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I have finished my first playthrough of the game, have put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.\\n\\nPersonally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. \\n\\nThe story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.\\n\\nI have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.\\n\\nOutside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable.</td>\n",

       "0  [h1]A dream for every Potterhead and those who want to become one![/h1]\\n[b][u]Spoiler free Review![/u][/b]\\n\\n\\nSometimes games are getting released with way too much hype. Forspoken, as an example, would be such a game. Either is it because of bad optimization or misinformation by the studio, the disappointment can end up being immeasurable for people who already pre-ordered these games, or people who have those games on their wishlist for months. Sadly, we had a lot of those lately. Don't even get me started with license games in general....\\n\\nHogwarts Legacy, on the other hand, shows that sometimes the hype train can be true.\\n\\nI don't usually pre-order games anymore, but the premise of being the best game based on the fantastic world of \"Harry Potter\" made me buy it in an instant.\\n\\nThe following review won't contain any spoilers! I also want to mention that I am not even close to the end of the game, because I have way too much fun exploring.\\n\\n[i]Also I know about the controversy, but it won't be part of my review (Not even as a meme!).[/i]\\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2929913613\\n\\n\\n[h1]Story:[/h1]\\nSo far so good. It starts off with a generic \"You are the chosen one!\" scenario, but it is going to get better and better the further you go. You just have to trust me on this one, because I don't want to give away too many information. All I can say is that the story fits the HP universe very well. If this game would be a book I wouldn't be able to stop reading it until the very end.\\n\\n\\n[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]\\nOverwhelming, would be the right word. There are so many mechanics in this game it is amazing and exhausting at the same time.\\n\\nFirst off you have the exploration part, where you can move around freely and explore every inch of Hogwarts and its surroundings. I tell you there is a lot to discover and to collect. Mysteries that need to be solved, locks that need to be picked and information about special places that need to be gathered. The amount of collectibles are insane and you will most likely spent hours over hours getting everything to 100%. The puzzles you can find are very well-made and solving them is fun.\\n\\nThen you have your main quests and side quests. I really love the side quests in this one, because they involve your fellow students. You learn to know them a bit better every time and the most of the quests are very creative.\\n\\nAlso: You don't get exp by fighting enemies! You get exp by discovering new locations, doing mini games or other things like that.\\n\\nIf you want to get from one point of the map to the other, you can also use the \"Floo powder\" fast travel service, or use your good old broom! I prefer the last one. It just feels great to fly around and enjoy the world. It might even sometimes happens that I just fly around aimlessly just for fun.  \\n\\nDecorating, Crafting and Fantastic Beasts are going to be part of the game as well. But it would be way too spoilery to mention anything more! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Combat:[/h1]\\n\\nWhat would be a wizard/witch without a magical wand. Most of the time you might be using it for puzzles, lighten up the area or scanning your surroundings, but the further you go the stronger enemies you have to face. Good that you start to learn attack and defense spells very soon. There might just be a handful of them, but the key is that you can combine them. Hit an enemy with 3 basic spells, pull it towards you, hit 3 more times, set it in flames, push it back and hit it ones again. Different combos cause different effects, combining them makes them stronger. You learn those combos as well, but you are also free to experiment on your own. \\n\\nFighting the enemies also never gets old. Some of them might have shields and you need the right spells to break through them and others can only be dealt with when they get attacked by fire. \\n\\nFor your defense you can also use a shield spell or dodge roll out of the danger zone. It should be clear that you can't really deflect a power attack by a troll. It has something of a Souls-Like, because it also comes with a parry button and more.\\nThe further you go the further you can upgrade your spells as well, for extra effects and power.\\n\\nAs a sidenote: You also don't need to fight most of the time, if you don't want to. There is always the option to sneak past enemies, or silently stun them.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The RPG Part:[/h1]\\n\\nThere is not that much RPG in this game as I hoped it would be (And this is my only negative point.). I feel like that you don't really can control most quest/story outcomes. In dialogues you can be mean or friendly, but there is not as much difference in both as I wished it would be. You might get more Gold out of a quest by asking for a better reward or by blackmailing, but that also doesn't fit your overall appearance during cut scenes. I mean you can create your own character and choose the house you want to join and also have a skill tree, but thats about it.\\nI just want to throw in that the voice actors are doing and amazing work! \\n\\n\\n[h1]The Atmosphere:[/h1]\\n\\nJust wow!  \\nHogwarts alone is gigantic and it feels amazing to get lost in all those beautifully handcrafted and unique halls, rooms and dungeons. The living paintings, the ghosts and the students running around in the halls is so atmospheric. The neighboring villages and landmarks do the same trick. You maybe want to walk all the way to Hogsmeade and drink Butter beer, just to lose yourself in that weird looking, but fascinating architecture of the buildings. Don't even get me started with the Forbidden Forest and other locations, you would be able to recognize from the movies and books.\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Graphics:[/h1]\\n\\nI play this game on a mix of medium to low, on my I7 4790 and my 1060 6 GB and the game still looks amazing. As a passionate screenarcher (screenshoter) I won't be able to make any good screenshots in the game, but just for playing it is more than enough. The fps are stable and I never noticed any pop-ins or any texture loading. The Unreal Engine 4 does a wonderful job and just shows how good it can still be (Compared to UE5)!\\n\\n\\n[h1]The Soundtrack:[/h1]\\n\\nSimply magical!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAesuW6qZU8\\nI also love that they mix new composed songs with the soundtrack from the movies. It just feels right!\\n\\n\\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\\n\\n[u]You know you want it! For me it is already GOTY. Not a single game in the last months kept me so occupied. Now if you excuse me I have to collect more things for my potions and maybe get lost on my way in a random ruin hunting for treasure.[/u]   \n",

put 57.9 hours into it at this point and completed the content to 100% outside of a few steam trophies.\\n\\nPersonally, I have really enjoyed this game and think it's a great release and everything I ever wanted out of a Harry Potter game. \\n\\nThe story is good, the voice acting is actually phenomenal on the part of the non player characters. As for the player characters there is a slight issue of a robotic voice likely due to the pitch but nothing that was game breaking. The combat is engaging, though I do lament a lack of variety when it comes to the enemies we confront. Hogwarts and the world are represented in incredible detail and I have lost myself running through the castle and taking it in more than once.\\n\\nI have a few gripes with the game sadly, that I do hope are fixed in down the line. The lack of a photo mode for example, a few animation issues with certain foes like the trolls who rubberband to follow the player character to complete their animations, and as said above a lack of enemy variety. As well, I wish there were more missions in the school focused around the student life, as we quickly feel like a part time student. The castle does lack a bit in classes to take to learn more about the universe itself or even just student activities like Quidditch, Wizards Chess, and more.\\n\\nOutside of those slight gripes with the game, I think Avalanche did a terrific job bringing the universe of Harry Potter to life through this game. And I look forward to what they do in the future with it, may it be via DLC or potential similar games exploring other parts of the wizarding world with other academies like Ilvermorny, Beauxbâtons, Durmstrang or even stories focused around the adults of the universe with the Ministries. I believe a lot of people may enjoy playing as an Auror or a Unspeakable.   \n",

       "      <td>[h1]Summary[/h1]\\nHogwarts Legacy is the best Harry Potter game to date, but as a game on its own merit, at its current price range, it leaves something to be desired. \\n\\nThis game is a [b]THUMBS UP[/b] for Harry Potter fans, or fans of the Witcher 3's combat and exploration. This game is very similar to the Witcher 3 in a LOT of ways, from the style of the combat, to the four equippable spells, to the repeating side-mission-esque puzzles and minor boss fights.\\n\\nFor everyone else, however, it's a thumbs down. For 60 euros, you're getting maybe 20-25 hours of actual content. The rest is copy+paste side-missions and exploration. Now, the team here has made a AMAZING environment, but its big heavy-hit is nostalgia. Without the nostalgia, the environment is impressive, but not nearly as much as it is for a fan of the series.\\n\\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Story[/b]\\nThe story is awful. I'm sorry, but I have to be honest here. It's so bland and childish it's kind of embarassing. And it leaks into the characters and conversations too. The protagonist literally massacres hundreds of dark wizards and goblins, as a 15 year old, and nobody, including themselves, bats an eye at this. The actual main plot is not explored nearly to the extent that I wish it was, instead giving you a moustache-twirling villain, with hopelessly under-explored motives.\\n\\nIf you're here looking for the magical story-telling of the books, RUN! It's not here!\\n\\nThis is really what ruins the game for me. As I will cover later, the game actually has good characters that I'd love to see more of, but you rarely see more than one of them at a time. You interact with them in the same way that a WoW character interacts with quest NPC's, and that's a real shame.\\n\\nWhat that means is that the main plot is mainly just you, the bland self-insert, doing literally everything. Sometimes another character is along, but it's just for the ride. You're the chosen one.\\n\\nThe combat is good, very good, but it's not THAT good.\\n\\nIn fact, the story ruins more than that, because it means that your main interaction with the beautiful environment is just... collectibles. The story utilises the awesome environment so little, in fact, often you are spirited away to completely separate mini-dungeons, where you then fight off boss-goons to advance.\\n\\nJust... why?\\n\\nOh yeah, and of course, the actual story is also super short, meaning you get very little content for your money. And replayability? Forget it. There are no decisions here. All playthroughs will be the same pretty much, especially if you try to complete your side-quests.\\n\\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\\n\\n[b]Side Characters[/b]\\nThe other characters fit well into the Harry Potter universe, without being carbon copies of book characters. In general, I found most of the characters pretty memorable. My favourite was Natty. I just thought she was nice.\\n\\nNone of the characters feel out place, and there is a pretty good selection of main characters to interact with. Sadly, only one of these characters really interacts that much with the main story, Professor Fig. He's the only one who is really there from start to finish, and even then only really as a mentor character. You really miss the shenanigans and shared adventures that the books portrayed. \\n\\nSadly, this just adds insult to the injury that is how they are used in the main story. I NEVER, not even ONCE, felt like I needed any of these characters. Except for teaching me a few spells, I, the main character, do EVERYTHING MYSELF. You don't get the feeling of complimenting talents like you do in the original series at all, it's just you against the goblin horde, assisted by Professor Fig who does boring study-stuff for you.\\n\\nWhat a waste!\\n\\n[b]Combat[/b]\\nThe real attraction is the combat. As I mentioned, it's very similar in feel to the Witcher 3. Now, if you've played the Witcher 3, you know that all runes except the protective one are basically useless compared to just hitting stuff with your sword.\\n\\nSo imagine the Witcher 3, but with awesome spells, and you have the combat in Hogwars Legacy. If you're good at cycling spell sets, you can do combos with an array of up to 16(!) different spells. The skill ceiling is insanely high on these, and it's a lot of fun to watch the fireworks so to speak, as you sling burning goblins into each other, back to you, set them on fire, and back again. It's A LOT of fun!\\n\\n[b]Environment[/b]\\nOh my goodnees, the environment! This is hands-down the most fun I've had exploring since... ever, probably. You get to bloody fly, and they barely restrict it! And it's awesome! There's so much to see, so much to collect. For completionists like me, it's both a dream and nightmare at the same time.\\n\\nMost places have little lore tid-bits for you to collect and read, and the environment is lovingly hand-crafted, with a real attention to detail. Especially Harry Potter fans will really appreciate it, but honesly I think it's impressive no matter who you are.\\n\\nThe only thing that really ruins it a bit, is the population of this world. Similar to early Cyberpunk, the sidewalk characters do.... literally nothing. They just walk around aimlessly, or stand idle in their set positions. Sometimes they say some neat things, but it's generally pretty disappointing when we're so used to better in games these days.\\n\\nBut otherwise, the environments of this game are beautiful. Graphically it's a bit last-gen, but the art direction is superb, and to top it off, it actually runs pretty well. At least, it does for me.</td>\n",

In the end... I´m the hero. \\n\\nNeither the ending nor anything else apart from maybe learning the 3 unforgiveables feels like its up to your choice. \\n\\nBeeing rude to NPCs / extorting them / betraying quest givers. \\nNothing happens... apart from maybe a different voiceline, but then everything is back to normal. \\n\\nI literally chose to take the powers. \\nI used all unforgivable curses. \\nNobody cared. I was the hero... YAAAAAAY.... \\n\\nReplay value probably 0 unless you want to see a different common room / play in different house colours and maybe have 5 different side quests... \\n\\nApart from that. \\nCharacter feels overpowered very very easily if you put the talent points in the right talents combined with the right gear enchantments. \\nWhich is very hard to avoid considering how many points you get vs how many points are even possible to spend in total...</td>\n",

       "      <td>I strongly believe that this game would not be as popular if it wasn't about the world of Harry Potter. There is an obvious love for visual details in the game, but there is not much substance behind it. \\nThe common rooms look beautiful, but there is absolutely nothing to do in them, you cannot talk to the npc's there, you cannot sit in a chair or sleep in your bed...\\n\\n These are but  a few minor details, but indicative of a bigger problem with the game; there is no immersion, your character does not seem to be part of the world. You cannot interact with most NPCs. they do not react to your spells, the dialogue options mostly do not matter for the progression of the story, there is no real day/night cycle (There is day and night, but shops are also open in the night, vendors do not seem to sleep or go out of their shop).\\n\\nAfter a few hours the combat gets repetitive, there is not a lot of enemy variety, the number of brewable potions and of plants is low. There is no real excitement of which spells you will be able to learn because the UI shows you all the spells and their names from the beginning, they are simply not selectable. The \"unforgivable\" curses are totally forgivable, there is 0 consequences to using them, during missions you can use them right next to your professor and he won't care in the slightest...\\n\\nMost hidden areas just contain a single chest with randomly generated loot. Your gear slots are very limited so you will have to fast travel a lot to vendors simply to get rid of the loot. Your gear is upgradeable, but I never bothered to upgrade it and under normal difficulty there really seems to be no reason to upgrade it.\\n\\nFinally there is a ton of collectibles (field pages, chests etc...) But these mostly to have been put in there to artificially add playing hours which provide little entertainement.\\n\\nI had a few hours of fun in the beginning, exploring the castle etc, but after that the veil fell and I noticed how basic the gameplay is and how unoriginal the main story line is. I would definitely wait for a price drop before buying it.\\n</td>\n",

There is one path, and it's the one the game gives you. There is no becoming a dark wizard, or a good one... you're just the character the game tells you to be.\\n\\nThe whole game is lifeless, NPCs don't react to anything you do, you can talk to some of them but that's it. You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people's house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won't say or do a thing, they just act like you're not even there. \\n\\nMost of the time you can't jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I'm still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can't attack centors, because yeah... you're not a bad person, so the game won't let you do bad things. \\n\\nYou can fly on a broom, and again, it's slow, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it's okay to ram into a wall. \\n\\nThe only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It's well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don't change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game's lead. It's basically a playable cinematic.\\n\\nSo to sum it up, it is yet again a very expensive game that brings nothing new to the table, with empty promises and seemingly half finished features. Was expecting this to be a Skyrim with HP world, turned out to be a plain adventure game you can't even play with your friends.\\n\\n4/10</td>\n",

I love this game with all my heart but the developers clearly do not and would rather sell you resused assests from the last kof in their game than give this game a netcode overhaul. I am deeply dissapointed in SNK and this is their 2nd best game after KoF 13 in almost a decade, which is pitiful to say the least. Would I like to be proven wrong? Absolutely. But SNK has resorted to being as cheap as possible with their game and refuses to fix their multiplayer in every game they've ever.</td>\n",

       "41    [h1]Summary[/h1]\\nHogwarts Legacy is the best Harry Potter game to date, but as a game on its own merit, at its current price range, it leaves something to be desired. \\n\\nThis game is a [b]THUMBS UP[/b] for Harry Potter fans, or fans of the Witcher 3's combat and exploration. This game is very similar to the Witcher 3 in a LOT of ways, from the style of the combat, to the four equippable spells, to the repeating side-mission-esque puzzles and minor boss fights.\\n\\nFor everyone else, however, it's a thumbs down. For 60 euros, you're getting maybe 20-25 hours of actual content. The rest is copy+paste side-missions and exploration. Now, the team here has made a AMAZING environment, but its big heavy-hit is nostalgia. Without the nostalgia, the environment is impressive, but not nearly as much as it is for a fan of the series.\\n\\n[h1]The Bad[/h1]\\n\\n[b]Story[/b]\\nThe story is awful. I'm sorry, but I have to be honest here. It's so bland and childish it's kind of embarassing. And it leaks into the characters and conversations too. The protagonist literally massacres hundreds of dark wizards and goblins, as a 15 year old, and nobody, including themselves, bats an eye at this. The actual main plot is not explored nearly to the extent that I wish it was, instead giving you a moustache-twirling villain, with hopelessly under-explored motives.\\n\\nIf you're here looking for the magical story-telling of the books, RUN! It's not here!\\n\\nThis is really what ruins the game for me. As I will cover later, the game actually has good characters that I'd love to see more of, but you rarely see more than one of them at a time. You interact with them in the same way that a WoW character interacts with quest NPC's, and that's a real shame.\\n\\nWhat that means is that the main plot is mainly just you, the bland self-insert, doing literally everything. Sometimes another character is along, but it's just for the ride. You're the chosen one.\\n\\nThe combat is good, very good, but it's not THAT good.\\n\\nIn fact, the story ruins more than that, because it means that your main interaction with the beautiful environment is just... collectibles. The story utilises the awesome environment so little, in fact, often you are spirited away to completely separate mini-dungeons, where you then fight off boss-goons to advance.\\n\\nJust... why?\\n\\nOh yeah, and of course, the actual story is also super short, meaning you get very little content for your money. And replayability? Forget it. There are no decisions here. All playthroughs will be the same pretty much, especially if you try to complete your side-quests.\\n\\n[h1] The Good [/h1]\\n\\n[b]Side Characters[/b]\\nThe other characters fit well into the Harry Potter universe, without being carbon copies of book characters. In general, I found most of the characters pretty memorable. My favourite was Natty. I just thought she was nice.\\n\\nNone of the characters feel out place, and there is a pretty good selection of main characters to interact with. Sadly, only one of these characters really interacts that much with the main story, Professor Fig. He's the only one who is really there from start to finish, and even then only really as a mentor character. You really miss the shenanigans and shared adventures that the books portrayed. \\n\\nSadly, this just adds insult to the injury that is how they are used in the main story. I NEVER, not even ONCE, felt like I needed any of these characters. Except for teaching me a few spells, I, the main character, do EVERYTHING MYSELF. You don't get the feeling of complimenting talents like you do in the original series at all, it's just you against the goblin horde, assisted by Professor Fig who does boring study-stuff for you.\\n\\nWhat a waste!\\n\\n[b]Combat[/b]\\nThe real attraction is the combat. As I mentioned, it's very similar in feel to the Witcher 3. Now, if you've played the Witcher 3, you know that all runes except the protective one are basically useless compared to just hitting stuff with your sword.\\n\\nSo imagine the Witcher 3, but with awesome spells, and you have the combat in Hogwars Legacy. If you're good at cycling spell sets, you can do combos with an array of up to 16(!) different spells. The skill ceiling is insanely high on these, and it's a lot of fun to watch the fireworks so to speak, as you sling burning goblins into each other, back to you, set them on fire, and back again. It's A LOT of fun!\\n\\n[b]Environment[/b]\\nOh my goodnees, the environment! This is hands-down the most fun I've had exploring since... ever, probably. You get to bloody fly, and they barely restrict it! And it's awesome! There's so much to see, so much to collect. For completionists like me, it's both a dream and nightmare at the same time.\\n\\nMost places have little lore tid-bits for you to collect and read, and the environment is lovingly hand-crafted, with a real attention to detail. Especially Harry Potter fans will really appreciate it, but honesly I think it's impressive no matter who you are.\\n\\nThe only thing that really ruins it a bit, is the population of this world. Similar to early Cyberpunk, the sidewalk characters do.... literally nothing. They just walk around aimlessly, or stand idle in their set positions. Sometimes they say some neat things, but it's generally pretty disappointing when we're so used to better in games these days.\\n\\nBut otherwise, the environments of this game are beautiful. Graphically it's a bit last-gen, but the art direction is superb, and to top it off, it actually runs pretty well. At least, it does for me.   \n",

Finished the Campaign and most other stuff ( 97% completion of my challenges ). \\nThe soundtrack and feeling you get is very nice, the artwork is amazing. \\n\\nI have stuttering issues but it was playable. (might be my pc tbh... i7-6700k isnt what it used to be :P ) \\n\\nThe thing that actually made me sad is the feeling that none of my decisions mattered.\\nWhatever I said, whenever I pushed for the \"Dark Side\".... In the end... I´m the hero. \\n\\nNeither the ending nor anything else apart from maybe learning the 3 unforgiveables feels like its up to your choice. \\n\\nBeeing rude to NPCs / extorting them / betraying quest givers. \\nNothing happens... apart from maybe a different voiceline, but then everything is back to normal. \\n\\nI literally chose to take the powers. \\nI used all unforgivable curses. \\nNobody cared. I was the hero... YAAAAAAY.... \\n\\nReplay value probably 0 unless you want to see a different common room / play in different house colours and maybe have 5 different side quests... \\n\\nApart from that. \\nCharacter feels overpowered very very easily if you put the talent points in the right talents combined with the right gear enchantments. \\nWhich is very hard to avoid considering how many points you get vs how many points are even possible to spend in total...   \n",

There is an obvious love for visual details in the game, but there is not much substance behind it. \\nThe common rooms look beautiful, but there is absolutely nothing to do in them, you cannot talk to the npc's there, you cannot sit in a chair or sleep in your bed...\\n\\n These are but  a few minor details, but indicative of a bigger problem with the game; there is no immersion, your character does not seem to be part of the world. You cannot interact with most NPCs. they do not react to your spells, the dialogue options mostly do not matter for the progression of the story, there is no real day/night cycle (There is day and night, but shops are also open in the night, vendors do not seem to sleep or go out of their shop).\\n\\nAfter a few hours the combat gets repetitive, there is not a lot of enemy variety, the number of brewable potions and of plants is low. There is no real excitement of which spells you will be able to learn because the UI shows you all the spells and their names from the beginning, they are simply not selectable. The \"unforgivable\" curses are totally forgivable, there is 0 consequences to using them, during missions you can use them right next to your professor and he won't care in the slightest...\\n\\nMost hidden areas just contain a single chest with randomly generated loot. Your gear slots are very limited so you will have to fast travel a lot to vendors simply to get rid of the loot. Your gear is upgradeable, but I never bothered to upgrade it and under normal difficulty there really seems to be no reason to upgrade it.\\n\\nFinally there is a ton of collectibles (field pages, chests etc...) But these mostly to have been put in there to artificially add playing hours which provide little entertainement.\\n\\nI had a few hours of fun in the beginning, exploring the castle etc, but after that the veil fell and I noticed how basic the gameplay is and how unoriginal the main story line is. I would definitely wait for a price drop before buying it.\\n   \n",

How are we at this point with PC builds of AAA games where they're actually unplayable because of stutters and fps dips. Regardless if I have everything on low or ultra, it doesnt matter.   \n",

This was advertised as \"make your own path\" kind of game, yet it can't be further away from the truth. There is one path, and it's the one the game gives you. There is no becoming a dark wizard, or a good one... you're just the character the game tells you to be.\\n\\nThe whole game is lifeless, NPCs don't react to anything you do, you can talk to some of them but that's it. You can go around casting spells, no one will even look at you or react the slightest. You can go and enter people's house after forcing their locks, go through their chests, they won't say or do a thing, they just act like you're not even there. \\n\\nMost of the time you can't jump to places, invisible walls everywhere, making exploration very linear and flavorless. Combat is fun, but I'm still looking for difficulty. Basically entered one of the most dangerous places, the Forbidden Forest, after 2 hours playing and defeated everything that came my way without breaking a sweat, there is no real danger or even sense of danger, and of course you can't attack centors, because yeah... you're not a bad person, so the game won't let you do bad things. \\n\\nYou can fly on a broom, and again, it's slow, no sensation or feeling of speed, you can go into an obstacle at full speed and you will just stop, no impact, no animation, nothing. You just stop like it's okay to ram into a wall. \\n\\nThe only decent thing about the game so far is the story. It's well designed, for now, but there is not much choices or decisions to take, and the only few really don't change anything to the story... you just go with it and follow the game's lead. It's basically a playable cinematic.\\n\\nSo to sum it up, it is yet again a very expensive game that brings nothing new to the table, with empty promises and seemingly half finished features. Was expecting this to be a Skyrim with HP world, turned out to be a plain adventure game you can't even play with your friends.\\n\\n4/10   \n",

It's fun, I loved it when playing it on the PS4 and was waiting for the Steam release so I could play more... but the online somehow is EVEN WORSE than the console version (where you have to deal with people more on wifi) ... SNK idk what you did, whether it's your dumb DRM you crammed into the game or what, but I'm disappointed. I actually have to refund this as an inferior product.\\n\\nDon't buy this on steam, but console if you have one. There's just no point here.   \n",

game to get love from SNK after the their horrendous track record when KoF 14 dropped. I love this game with all my heart but the developers clearly do not and would rather sell you resused assests from the last kof in their game than give this game a netcode overhaul. I am deeply dissapointed in SNK and this is their 2nd best game after KoF 13 in almost a decade, which is pitiful to say the least. Would I like to be proven wrong? Absolutely. But SNK has resorted to being as cheap as possible with their game and refuses to fix their multiplayer in every game they've ever.   \n",

But I can't condone SNK and their exclusivity deals with Epic, I only hope they don't pull this same garbage with the next KOF, it took Samurai Shodown nearly two years to come to Steam, and that is Haraam.   \n",

with multiple seasons of DLC, somehow still very long load times even when running on beastly computers, terrible terrible delay-based netcode. Very disappointed in SNK. This game is a gem underneath but it needs rollback netcode to stand a chance. As it is, there are very few players even during the first week of steam launch and it's only going to get deader from here.   \n",
